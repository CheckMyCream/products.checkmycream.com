      <li>I like the product even though I do prefer to make my own rose water.  </li>
      <li>It helped my hair grow faster and softer AND it gave my hair a nice shine  </li>
      <li>the rose water froze on the delivery truck I assume.  </li>
      <li>Sooo nice.</li>
      <li>It smells nice.</li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s a really nice treat to spray all over after a shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hertiage brand Rose Water for years and it is an excellent product. They did change the formula over the years, but it still works for me. I use it along with NAPCA with aloe vera. I spray the two head to toe every morning. I have the NAPCA on auto delivery here on Amazon @ 2 bottles per month. I don&#x27;t necessarily use that much but I don&#x27;t want to ever be without it. Good beauty/skin care involves committment. My rule of thumb is... whatever you do to your face, do for your whole body. The described is just part of my daily morning regimen. Hope this helps…</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner, has a very nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more (currently have this in my shopping cart).</li>
    <li> Wonderful for mid eastern cooking, adds the perfect touch to Baklava and rice cookies, but also has a lovely scent for cosmetic use.</li>
    <li> Great item. Packaging not so much. The cap was not securely closed/taped causing leakage and product loss. Other than issues with packaging, the product performed as it should.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! And it takes to freezing. It froze during shipping lol.  I use it as a body spray and occasionally in cooking.</li>
    <li> Awesome facial moisturizer for after makeup</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Once you&#x27;ve actually used natural rose water you&#x27;ll know the difference. This is like a refreshing spray, not something that should be put on your face. It made my face breakout in tiny little bumps.Thayers is a much better NATURAL product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma, light and envigorating!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and as described great product great seller thank you</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing my hair in between wash days! (4a-c hair)</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping. Love flower rose water - so many great uses, love that I could buy several - great deal. Thanks</li>
    <li> this smells absolutely divine!!  i love this spray!!!!  i will order it over and over!  it smells just like fresh roses!!!  this is perfect!</li>
    <li> It smells nice. But for some reason it occasionally make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. The atomizer works great. I use this on my face before moisturing with a lotion. I also use it to refresh my skin during the day. It does smell like roses and it&#x27;s not an obnoxious scent. I have naturally curly hair so periodically I use it to refresh my curls and add a bit of fragrance to my hair.</li>
    <li> This rose water smells really nice.This smells of a light but refreshing rose smell.I like how this feels in my skin.Im happy with this purchase.:)</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with rose water</li>
    <li> i love this, i carry it in my purse and spray to keep moisterized and anytime i need a wake me up, its better than going for the candy dish in the afternoon, very refreshing and smells good, hasn&#x27;t gone rancid and ive had the same bottle for a while now, i even spray the boys in my office :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted..was quick to be delivered. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love the rose smell and the nice mist bottle</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now. To be fair, I have completely changed my skin care routine so it&#x27;s difficult to attribute any changes to one particular product.  But i can say that the spray smells very light and flowery and it is quite refreshing for skin and hair. Also the delivery came as expected and i had no issues with any damage. I wish that I was patient enough to introduce one new item to my routine at a time so I could be sure what&#x27;s working and what isn&#x27;t, but that isn&#x27;t in my personality.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works great as a moisturizing facial mist, hair refresher or makeup setter. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I like the product even though I do prefer to make my own rose water.  Until spring comes around though this is a great alternative.  Very fragrant,  I love to use this for toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did though by ordering when the snow has arrived.  Even though the package was only on the porch for a few minutes before I brought it inside the rose water froze on the delivery truck I assume.  Since the water froze it expanded causing the bottom of the bottle to bow out so it will no longer sit flat and it also leaked.  I had to dump some of the product out as well as it began to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s fault of course.  I should have realized this could have happened considering it&#x27;s even so cold or the last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this rose water though.  Decent sized bottle for a decent price.</li>
    <li> I love this rose  spray.  It really is very calming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have in three rooms in my home and also at my office</li>
    <li> Smells great, use it for hair, face toner, make up setting and perfume. Freshen up towels sheets and makes baths delightful</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! And the smell is AMAZING!!!! I spray on my eye gels and they last a lot longer also!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. Much better price than other rose water I&#x27;ve found online. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells so great. I use this as a toner, mostly just to smell it!</li>
    <li> The rosewater smells very pleasant and fresh. The scent does not last, but that is probably (positively) related to the lack of chemicals to fix the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious as rose petals</li>
    <li> This is heavenly.  It is so much nicer than any of the products that you can buy at the stores.  Smells wonderful and is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and have purchased it for friends who also like and will be buying it again</li>
    <li> Super multifunctional. I use it as a face spray throughout the day and right after I shower and as a setting spray after my foundation routine to keep me from looking too matte.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. I use it constantly</li>
    <li> Great to spray anywhere even yourself. very useful in bathroom ;) Really does smell like fresh cut roses</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I love it! It&#x27;s wonderful for the skin with a subtle rose scent. Perfect as a toner and as a spritzer on hot days.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a youtuber said she used it directly on her hair. The smell of roses is very strong and even though the ingredient list says it&#x27;s only water, I diluted it with additional spring water in a spray bottle for use on my natural hair. It works great and smells great! You can even use this as a body splash and the scent stays with you for some time (not all day). I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> came without a cap so that was a little weird, but seems like a good product. smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing for the hair and even to spritz on your face!</li>
    <li> This spray bottle of magical rose water is wonderful.  It smells lovely...just like roses, but not too strong. Very soothing, the fine spray moistens your face but does not drip down your neck (unless you get carried away).  This has been around a long time.  A friend of mine recommended it.  Her father used it over 60 years ago to soothe his chapped face caused by working outside in all kinds of weather.  She inherited his sensitive skin and this is the only thing that she can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
    <li> Looove this product! It really calms my problem skin year round. I have combination skin type; in the winter it&#x27;s tight and dry - this adds a bit of moisture and calms redness. In the summer it helps keep acne clear and oil at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hate rose perfumes, soaps and such but this rose scent is so beautiful and natural. It&#x27;s not too strong and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the sprayer bottle because it cuts down on waste with cotton balls etc. and is quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone of any skin type looking for a good toner or refreshing mist for their face and body!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it in comparison to Essential rose water.  This Hydroessential is rose water does nothing for my skin but it smells like roses! The process it takes to make hydroessential rose water is the same as when making the essential rose water but the difference is they use the actual water the roses are bioled in and the essential water is from the steam that roses make during the boiling process, much like how distilled water is made.&lt;br /&gt;There is a world of difference between the quality.  I would use this for scent purposes only since it has more of a pugent rose fragrance than the essential rose water, which is excellent for my skin as is the Rosehip seed oil.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of the Rosewater. It&#x27;s a great product and will buy again. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love using this as a freshener throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells and feels great. The spray pump is awesome and the mist comes out very fine and evenly spread out. It&#x27;s also a large bottle that should last year anywhere from 6 months - 1 year depending on how often you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like to spray this on immediately after I wash my face before I apply my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Good way to refresh skin on hot days and hydrate when traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for me.  Really smells like roses....refreshing and delicious</li>
    <li> This smells pretty but what else does it do?  I used this on my face and neck area two times a day for a little over a month and didn&#x27;t see any particular changes in my skin. I&#x27;d read on the internet that it was supposed to act as an anti-inflammatory, rejuvenate the skin, soften it… yada, yada, yada.  It was refreshing and again, smelled nice, but nothing really that special.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again, but maybe just for the smell alone.</li>
    <li> I can barely smell the rose scent- it&#x27;s very diluted.  The smell also changes to something very unpleasant on the skin, hair or anything else that&#x27;s being sprayed on after a while.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Loooovvveeee this... I need more so glad bc this reminded me of that.. Going to order it now.. I&#x27;m trying to see where I can buy it locally</li>
    <li> I mist my face after every shower and night washing and it hydrates and gives me a beautiful slightly dewy look. The scent is light and perfect. Would recommend this again and again!</li>
    <li> This rose spray is absolutely wonderful. As a perfume, as a refresher any time anywhere- it smells amazing and raises energy vibrations.</li>
    <li> Good for my face but my decolage broke out from it.  Not a fan of rose scents as I am sensitive to strong scents but it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> Really does work! Gets rid of acne, dark circles, and really hydrates the skin! Absolutely love it; I just purchased my third bottle! :D</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s done for $10 but it works! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff! I even started mixing it with rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle to clean my makeup brushes with. Now I can literally stop and smell the roses every morning!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE...WILL ALWAYS REPURCHASE.</li>
    <li> Sooo nice. This is fantastic for summer weather. I spritz this on my face right before bed, and after cleansing in the morning. It is also great for &amp;#34;Frownies&amp;#34;. I never had results with them until I used this to spritz. That&#x27;s not even why I bought this, but a nice added bonus. (*_~)</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater! It has a light, fresh scent. I use it daily as a face toner; it&#x27;s great sprayed on alone or mixed with a little apple cider vinegar. Also nice sprayed on throughout the day when you need to feel refreshed, especially on a hot summer day. It&#x27;s also nice sprayed onto hair, clothes, &amp; body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand synthetic perfumes or other strong scents, so this rosewater is a good option for me. It has  a light, natural floral scent, which others would only be able to smell if they put their nose up to your skin (which is how I like it); it makes you feel feminine, without being overpowering. If you want to leave a cloud of synthetic fragrance wherever you go, then buy some stinky perfume. However, if you&#x27;d just like a lovely light kiss of natural rose scent, with other great skin benefits, choose Heritage Rosewater!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I regularly purchase this brand of rosewater at my local health food store.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing as a pick me up during long days.</li>
    <li> Smells so good!! i use it very often, because i live in a tropical country i use this as a refresh splash.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Refreshing for the face and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> This rosewater smells heavenly....just like old fashioned roses I remember from my grandmother&#x27;s garden.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long but it&#x27;s a really nice treat to spray all over after a shower.</li>
    <li> Good smell, great as a toner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this rosewater for years and, w/ \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot; &amp; living above 5000 FT, it has worked WONDERS.  Immediately after showering, when I wake up, when I get off work, before I go out...I just spray my face 2-3 times and I&#x27;m good to go.  Not only does it smell fresh, the spritz on my face is super-refreshing AND, I can tell it does an awesome job moisturizing my face.  As an added note, I also use ROSEHIP OIL as a moisturizer in combination w/ this product (though only once a day) and my skin looks and feels better than it ever has.  I will swear by this product and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> smells great and goes on clean.  I use it as a toner and also in my homemade vitamin c serum.  Love the way it smells and it is easily absorbed.  Would order again, just love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Use this as a facial and body toner under oils and lotions.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this to, but I love spritzing this before my lotion, to freshen up, or just because I feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps to kill the smell of my dog, but he hates it when I spritz it on him!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it after I take a shower and also in the morning.It has a nice mist to it when I spray it.  It has a rose smell which I love! I like it because it feels comfortable.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Quality product that has a fragrance that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have never tried rosewater before but I was curious and read on the benefits for the skin. I have hormonal acne, with an oily T-zone and then dry flakiness in other areas. This helps my skin feel balanced but moisturized if I throw it on in place of my witch hazel toner. The Rosewater literally smells like you&#x27;ve stuck your face into a bouquet of 76 roses! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing and made me feel like a beautiful garden all day. I spritzed it in my hair, on myself as well as a mild toner for my face.&#x27; I just can&#x27;t get enough of the smell. It&#x27;s not &#x27;old lady&#x27; roses -- it&#x27;s a fresh rose. I&#x27;m 21 and have never loved roses until recently and boy am I glad I&#x27;m a convert because whoa is the scent strong. If you don&#x27;t like rose scent, you will be overpowered by this. For me, it&#x27;s a wonderful thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from a different site but I am SO happy to see it here and in different smells?! I would like to try Lilac...and Lavender...and the rose/glycerin!! Soon! It&#x27;s a good deal, IMO, compared to other retailers. I bought mine for $9 for 8 oz and I think that&#x27;s a great deal. The big bottle is too large to travel with but it&#x27;s super pretty and very pink on my vanity so I love it!</li>
    <li> Although I have found higher quality rose water, the spray on this bottle is a nice fine mist so I can use it to set my makeup or lightly spray on my body. Also, it is a very good value.</li>
    <li> COOL AND VERY REFRESHING AFTER EXFOLIATING MY FACE. I LEAVE IN THE FRIDGE FOR EXTRA COOLNESS. UGLY PACKAGING BUT OTHER WISE WONDERFUL PRODUCT</li>
    <li> The Rose Water is literally that - water with a slight scent of Rose that does not last at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered the regular rosewater and got the glycerin water instead and it&#x27;s sticky and tacky on your skin. I would not order the glycerin rose water, it doesn&#x27;t smell good either, kind of like baby powder or diaper product like that. Wish I could find my old brand at the healthfood store, it was so good. This just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> amazing product and smell really nice!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  I use it in my hair.  This is the 2nd time purchasing and I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what it says it is. Perfect condition. A lovely scent. Really smells like actual roses and not processed chemicals.</li>
    <li> fast deleivery excellent</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. But I have used others. I&#x27;m sure its the same.</li>
    <li> My favorite rose water, shipped fast.</li>
    <li> As far as rosewater is concerned I&#x27;ve tried expensive brands of pure rose water, made my own rosewater, etc. I was looking for a nice product that I didn&#x27;t have to make myself. Heritage is a nice compromise. It is water with rose absolute in it, not made by the steam distillation of rose petals. All in all, it works as a toner with nice &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; rose smell, and didn&#x27;t make me break out :)</li>
    <li> it smells nice but I was kinda dissapointed when I found it&#x27;s just a mixture of water and lavender oil. real lavender water should be made by distillation.</li>
    <li> This is no longer manufactured by Heritage House -- it&#x27;s now manufactured by something called &amp;#34;Seychelles Organics, Inc.&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s not as good now. There&#x27;s less rose scent.   Seychelles Organics also bought out the company essential-oil company &amp;#34;Simplers&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;ve noticed a steep decline in that company&#x27;s products as well.</li>
    <li> Great products&lt;br /&gt;This is the best toner I have ever used for my dry skin. I am happy I read the review and decided buy two for myself.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I spray it to refresh my face when I wake up or if I am just around the house with no makeup on. Its very light and again refreshing!</li>
    <li> I love this Rose Flower Water and use it as a toner before moisturizing, have for years and will order from this seller again if available in the future.</li>
    <li> beautiful and natural scent. love it! It&#x27;s a relaxing and moisturizes the skin very quickly. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I spray it on my face before I go to sleep and when I wake up. My boyfriend even has me spray his face before we go to sleep :)</li>
    <li> I use this rosewater as a facial toner! It&#x27;s so soothing, fresh, and is very useful for my combination skin type! It also smells really good :)</li>
    <li> Great Product at a great price !</li>
    <li> Loved this product i use it on hair as well as my face. its so refreshing !!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a lot of scented things but I am not allergic to roses so this is wonderful. It helps clear out any old stale air in your house - and brings a more positive energy. Both of my kids are sensitive as well and they love spraying this in their rooms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and love it! Order was recieved in the time promised. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just LOVE the product!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, not overpowering, can spray it on your body.</li>
    <li> Great product and I use daily.</li>
    <li> Love this rose water! I use it everyday after I wash my face as a natural skin toner to even out my skin tone, and absorb additional oils in my face. I put some on a cotton ball after washing my face and apply in an upward motion then put a mixture of almond oil and castor oil on my face then spray my face with the rose water.</li>
    <li> The Rose smell is delightful!</li>
    <li> Perfect as ordered.  Just goes too fast.  Time for more...</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my hair i loved it. It smells great the smell this is one of the reasons I love this product.  The smell is not to harsh it has a light smell. It helped my hair grow faster and softer AND it gave my hair a nice shine  .It came in a big bottle to so it was worth every dime.THIS IS A MIRACLE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is such a delicate fragrance, not cheap or artificial  like a lot of rose waters. Its so calming and refreshing. My daughter has dry hair and she started using this on her hair after styling. It made her hair so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this I have been waiting so long for this! I use it right after I shower as a spray for my face and after I do my makeup as a setting spray it really does help my makeup stay on longer. No irritations it is very good in my skin and I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Compared to other rosewater, this one smells perfumey. I have am allergic to stronger scents, so I have to be careful what I use near my face. Having said that, I went ahead and tried the rosewater anyway. It&#x27;s very soothing, and my skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! If you&#x27;re looking for a product that soothes, moisturizes, and softens and you can tolerate a strong scent then I would recommend this for you. **Update, since I&#x27;ve opened the flower water and air has gotten into the bottle, the strong odor has quieted down considerably!**</li>
    <li> Its helped calm and soothe my skin. I love it. I wish the rose smell was less old timer and for sweet smelling rose. But I&#x27;m going to make my own next time.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very hydrating</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this rose water for use in blending all natural facial products. Having no thickeners, it blends wonderfully with liquid aloe and essential oils to create witch hazel free natural toners and cleansers. It even makes for a wonderful moisturizing toner all by itself! This is great for anyone looking for remedies for acne and other skin complaints.</li>
    <li> Been using this for months now. I love combining it with avocado oil to make a facial serum - the only things I could put on my face after my second pregnancy made me highly allergic to virtually everything that touched my face, neck and decollete. The smell is divine. My only choice!</li>
    <li> I will definitely order again.  I water it down and add glycerin for a refresh in hair mist.  My hair is braided now so I&#x27;ve added some oils to keep my hair moisturized.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I will never again be without it</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Wonderful smell and have used it for many different reasons. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is crap.  You get scent for a second and then it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> It came pretty quickly and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Never tried rose water before - Ilike it - I have been using on my face to freshen  up</li>
