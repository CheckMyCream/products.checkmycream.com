### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
      <li>It is perfectly ash!!!!  </li>
      <li>It gave me multi demential color which looks great!!!!</li>
      <li>I am still very happy with the results</li>
      <li>Very very very impressed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this toner!!</li>
      <li>My hair looks absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Perfect color for me, helped way better than t18 at getting the brassiness out of my hair after bleaching!</li>
      <li>Great product as it was under $10.</li>
      <li>Works great, I just prefer the T18 for my hair type/color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>My hair is even and it&#x27;s a gorgeous shiny silver.</li>
      <li>the warm tones on my warm complexion was just - ick.  </li>
      <li>I have a habit of doing beauty treatments on my own</li>
      <li>I actually kind of liked it --</li>
      <li>I have been super happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>This is very strong toner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that really nice &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; blonde-it kinda darkened it, but it looks really beautiful and natural.</li>
      <li>I think this one (after lots of trial and error) is the best blue to cancel out orange and get the results you want.</li>
      <li>So I ended up creating more orange than I was cancelling with the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am wondering if the cooling violet additive would help, or if I use vol 10 developer instead, I will have to do more research before I try anything else.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So to get that lighter, more silvery color</li>
      <li>The blonde is PERFECT!!!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d call the toner Gray Lady, not Silver Lady -- but decided I wanted it lighter, more like what I think silver should be :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>-mostly it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure those are fixable.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
      <li>I left it on 15 minutes and it seemed like the perfect amount of time.</li>
      <li>I like it more than the T16 which didn&#x27;t do a thing to my hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give this a fair rating since it wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.  </li>
      <li>The T14 toner did not look very good on my virgin hair that was bleached (lemon yellow level/white level) however, so a mix w/T18 or doing each part separately is advised.</li>
      <li>I was a notch below light brown in most parts and light brown on top, but it was still &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; I guess</li>
      <li>Less than 15 mins of using this toner, my hair was perfect!</li>
      <li>So I used Clairol&#x27;s Nice &amp; Easy permanent color, and that was a great light ash blonde, but I didn&#x27;t want to keep using permanent color -- too much</li>
      <li>and now I am not afraid to do it again!</li>
      <li>I used this to tone my rather brassy hair, which was originally black-brown</li>
      <li>I always used Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts light ash blonde and loved it -- but they&#x27;ve changed it so much over the years that it no longer gives me the beautiful ashy blonde that I loved.</li>
      <li>Most looked okay, but the roots were pretty much pee-yellow.  </li>
      <li>It did reduce the bright brassiness and yellow</li>
      <li>I am so happy I only tried it in some strands of hair first (1st.</li>
      <li>I have medium length thick hair and ordered two which covered all my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>Definitely a success, and cheap,</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as is described you need to make sure your hair is prelightened to a very light shade of blonde.</li>
      <li>I looked more like a dark blonde and was very happy with the color.</li>
      <li>that T-18 is for super blond hair and if you haven&#x27;t lightened all the way you should use T-14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried to find a toner that would make my hair close to the gray that&#x27;s coming, kind of a gray/blonde, if possible, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to tone</li>
      <li>You should do it right after bleaching</li>
      <li>/&gt;Luckily I still have lots of manic panic left so I was able to get my hair back to a color suitable for work.  </li>
      <li>So glad I did not put this in my entire head.</li>
      <li>In the first part of the photo you can see</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll say that 1 bottle was a stretch, so definitely purchase 2 bottles unless you have super fine hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased two more times, would not bleach my hair again without following up with this toner.</li>
      <li>I adore the shade of blonde it gives me (compared to the T18, which seems to be everyone&#x27;s favorite).</li>
      <li>I bleached again leaving the hair even more yellow somehow.</li>
      <li>Rinsed, didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference so with the leftover product I put the rest on my roots again, this time for a full 30 minutes as instructed on the box.  </li>
      <li>It took all brassiness out of my medium/dark blonde hair and gave me a nice cool blonde.  </li>
      <li>Toner worked well and easily with Wella Volume 20 Developer to remove brassy tones left by bleaching.</li>
      <li>I use Wen and followed up with a 20 minute wen conditioning treatment and my hair is super soft and not damaged.  </li>
      <li>My hair turned out a lovely natural looking cooler shade of blonde, pretty similar to my eyebrows which is pretty sweet.  </li>
      <li>It arrived within a day or so of ordering and was really well packaged.  </li>
      <li>I have to mix 2 parts toner to 1 part developer though because otherwise my hair lifts too much</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>and now my hair is still a warm blonde but not orange blonde.  </li>
      <li>It lifted nicely and i got it to a pale blond shade.  </li>
      <li>My hair is an exact match to my natural color.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how gray it came out, no brassiness at all, almost exactly the color of my natural gray.</li>
      <li>I used a 30 volume developer with Super Blue by L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
      <li>It also helps to add a few drops of coconut oil to it for keeping my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It turned out a little orange but after using the wella toner my hair was a nice light brown/ dark blond color.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend this stuff.</li>
      <li>got fed up with my hair being so high maintenance that I dyed my hair brown with a demi to be done with it.</li>
      <li>For some reason, it didnt do much so the next day, i got my hair wet, left some good conditioner in and did it again.  </li>
      <li>If I love that, I&#x27;ll use it with 40 volume to permanently get rid of the remains of the N&amp;E, then use it as a toner every few weeks.</li>
      <li>Used this exactly to the directions and barely toned my hair at all.</li>
      <li>I have medium/dark brown hair which I have been lightening to light brown with some dark blond.  </li>
      <li>I bleached once and my hair was pretty yellow at the roots</li>
      <li>my natural hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this in one instance so far:</li>
      <li>It totally fixed the brassiness.</li>
      <li>I might get a more green blue).  </li>
      <li>So I bought some Loreal super ash blonde or something and dyed it all back blonde.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t immediately tone after bleaching anymore as the bleaching process is already pretty rough on my hair.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a dark enough blue to counter the orange in light brown/orange hair</li>
      <li>Like a couple of other reviewers said, this stuff works fast!</li>
      <li>It looked fine, just after a while it started to wash out, the sun lightened it :/, and ultimately my roots were showing from a mix matched tone, not level.</li>
      <li>or higher volume in porous hair, it will absorb all the ash/black of the color and your hair will become dark.</li>
      <li>have thick, coarse, full volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair naturally that pulls heavy gold when messed with.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to leave it in very long, (some ladies report that it can turn light levels of hair green).</li>
      <li>I first went back from black to blonde</li>
      <li>I ordered the T14 pale ash blonde and this item was shipped exactly as described.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s awesome.  I left it on to the grey stage.</li>
    <li> I pre-lightened my hair.  I used a 30 volume developer with Super Blue by L&#x27;Oreal.  It lifted nicely and i got it to a pale blond shade.  I left it in for 45 minutes.  I then used Wella toner T14 with 20 developer and left it in for 30 minutes.  For some reason, it didnt do much so the next day, i got my hair wet, left some good conditioner in and did it again.  Left it in for 25 minutes.  It is perfectly ash!!!!  Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies also has everything.</li>
    <li> *This review is for the t14 shade*&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go blonde from very dark brown. I have a habit of doing beauty treatments on my own-mostly it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Anyways after bleaching twice and using some loreal ash blonde, as well as their brass banisher, I still had a ton of brass red &amp; orange tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the wella 20 vol developer cream, left it in for 30 min. I&#x27;ll say that 1 bottle was a stretch, so definitely purchase 2 bottles unless you have super fine hair. during the 30 min it looked like my hair had some blue/purple/green tones, so I knew the toner was working it&#x27;s magic. My hair also looked dark-honestly kinda like a gross dirty blonde, and I was concerned it would look crappy when I rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong-The blonde is PERFECT!!! finally!!! It&#x27;s that really nice &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; blonde-it kinda darkened it, but it looks really beautiful and natural. It totally fixed the brassiness. I totally would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking to fix orange/red tones.</li>
    <li> If you have dark brown-medium brown hair that has been dyed then bleached and it&#x27;s not the shade of blonde you want, try this toner. You should do it right after bleaching but I did it the day after my hair was done at the salon and it toned it and evened out this horrid orange color. I think this one (after lots of trial and error) is the best blue to cancel out orange and get the results you want.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve been experimenting and trying to go silver for a while now. I bleached once and my hair was pretty yellow at the roots so I toned with Wella T18. It left my ends a weird grey purple and my roots were still really yellow. I bleached again leaving the hair even more yellow somehow. Finally I decided to try Wella T14. I mixed it with a 10 volume (1 part toner to 2 parts developer) and left it on for about 25 minutes. My hair is even and it&#x27;s a gorgeous shiny silver. There are still yellow tones but I also didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough so I&#x27;m sure those are fixable. Overall I&#x27;m very impressed and I would highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is very strong toner. I am so happy I only tried it in some strands of hair first (1st. 30 minutes, 2nd. 5 minute trial  with 10 volume developer). In the 30 minute strand test with 10 vol. developer it turned the honey-blonde/reddish brown strands platinum-ashy blonde like the picture! In the the 5 minute strand test with 10 vol. developer still too blonde-ashy, still too pale gray. In the last 30 minute strand with 20 volume developer as recommended by the manufacturer Wella, it turned the strand dark brown almost black! So glad I did not put this in my entire head. I would have cried! I conclude that if your hair is porous (damaged hair, or hair that has been bleached) only use 10 volume to deposit color (but do not use ash colors in porous hair), if you use an ash color with a 20 vol. or higher volume in porous hair, it will absorb all the ash/black of the color and your hair will become dark. In summary, in porous hair 10volume-gray results, in porous hair 20 volume-black results.</li>
    <li> After bleaching my hair at home from a brown it turned into an orange.  I have medium length thick hair and ordered two which covered all my hair perfectly. I left it on for recommended 35 minutes and took away alot of the orange. I looked more like a dark blonde and was very happy with the color.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for me, helped way better than t18 at getting the brassiness out of my hair after bleaching! It also helps to add a few drops of coconut oil to it for keeping my hair nice and soft. I left it on 15 minutes and it seemed like the perfect amount of time. It&#x27;s a bit scary when all your hair turns purple while processing but it all rinsed out. It gave me multi demential color which looks great!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been super happy with this product.  It took all brassiness out of my medium/dark blonde hair and gave me a nice cool blonde.  Just wish it would last longer.  I have to mix 2 parts toner to 1 part developer though because otherwise my hair lifts too much and I don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
    <li> After watching several youtube videos I realized I had needed a blue/violet toner on my hair to get rid of the brassiness and yellow.  I ordered the T14 pale ash blonde and this item was shipped exactly as described.  It arrived within a day or so of ordering and was really well packaged.  I mixed this item with a 20 volume wella color charm developer which I also purchased from Amazon.  My hair was just slightly damp when I applied and left it on for about 20 minutes.  It did reduce the bright brassiness and yellow and now my hair is still a warm blonde but not orange blonde.  I like this product and will definitely order again.  I use Wen and followed up with a 20 minute wen conditioning treatment and my hair is super soft and not damaged.  I will probably tone my hair again in a few weeks as usual and will use this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the T14 - Pale Ash Blonde to tone my hair after bleaching (I used Schwartzkopf&#x27;s Crystal Blonde Me bleach and 9% / 30 volume toner) which took the shade way down, but definitely left a brassy tint on my hair. In the first part of the photo you can see my bleached, sort of orange hair - in the subsequent two photos are after toning - a lot of the brassiness has gone (the ends are still a bit strawberry blonde owing to the fact that they had been dyed dark some time ago, the rest was my natural hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a 20 vol developer, left it on for fifteen minutes, but I may do so again tomorrow to remove any lingering brassiness - I was afraid of my hair turning grey / purple - it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this a fair rating since it wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.  I have medium/dark brown hair which I have been lightening to light brown with some dark blond.  To tone out the orange I use manic panic shocking blue mixed in my conditioner (although shocking blue has red in it(its purplish) blue and next time I might get a more green blue).  I am still very happy with the results but I have to use it every time I wash my hair so I thought I might try something that lasts longer.  I did a little research (but not enough!) and I found this.  I read somewhere that T-18 is for super blond hair and if you haven&#x27;t lightened all the way you should use T-14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake 1: I got T-14.  This isn&#x27;t a dark enough blue to counter the orange in light brown/orange hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake 2: I got vol 20 developer because it said to on the box.  The developer lightened my hair a shade or 2 like its supposed to, but my hair is still dark enough that lightening turns it orange.  So I ended up creating more orange than I was cancelling with the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I still have lots of manic panic left so I was able to get my hair back to a color suitable for work.  I am wondering if the cooling violet additive would help, or if I use vol 10 developer instead, I will have to do more research before I try anything else.</li>
    <li> Got a lot of the brassiness out of my blonde hair,  but I&#x27;m going to have to tone again to get the rest. Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> mix it with with 14 it&#x27;s was okish</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was soooo nervous to try an at-home solution to a salon-created problem that was costing me lots of money, but I decided to go for it.  I am normally about a 7, the darker end of a natural blonde, though have had highlights, color, etc for years, usually some variation of blonde.  Recently I tried am ombr&amp;eacute; look from the salon that ended up a catastrophe.  I had copper roots, blondish ends, and the warm tones on my warm complexion was just - ick.  So I bought some Loreal super ash blonde or something and dyed it all back blonde.  Most looked okay, but the roots were pretty much pee-yellow.  Ha.  Dealt with it for a few days until I had time to work out the dilemma on the weekend.  Went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and bought the T14 which has blue-violet hues to tone down orange and yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my hair and followed the instructions - 2 parts 20-developer and 1 part wella product.  Put it all over roots for about 15-18 minutes and got nervous.  Rinsed, didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference so with the leftover product I put the rest on my roots again, this time for a full 30 minutes as instructed on the box.  My hair turned out a lovely natural looking cooler shade of blonde, pretty similar to my eyebrows which is pretty sweet.  I could have left it on even longer I think, but will just use shimmer lights blonde enhancing/brassiness-removing shampoo for a while, then retone again in a few weeks as needed.  I am so pumped about the result, especially for how nervous I was to try it myself.  Definitely a success, and cheap, and now I am not afraid to do it again!</li>
    <li> Works great, I just prefer the T18 for my hair type/color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, full volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair naturally that pulls heavy gold when messed with. I&#x27;ve used this in one instance so far: after bleach with 20vol developer (Wella Color Charm developer is my recommendation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first went back from black to blonde I had quite a bit of orange. For orange hair, I suggest this toner. The T14 toner did not look very good on my virgin hair that was bleached (lemon yellow level/white level) however, so a mix w/T18 or doing each part separately is advised. I didn&#x27;t have to leave it in very long, (some ladies report that it can turn light levels of hair green). If you are going for &#x27;silver&#x27; hair though, then you do want to use this toner on your lemon yellow/white level hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I need an all over application once every month and a half to two months. Also, that I prefer using the 10vol developer over the 20vol developer when following bleaching. I don&#x27;t immediately tone after bleaching anymore as the bleaching process is already pretty rough on my hair. But that also is because I&#x27;m not super fond of living life in hair masks often.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as is described you need to make sure your hair is prelightened to a very light shade of blonde. This is a toner not a hair dye so it only helps you reach the desired tone, It does not dye your hair or work that way.</li>
    <li> I have such a love/hate with the T14 toner. I adore the shade of blonde it gives me (compared to the T18, which seems to be everyone&#x27;s favorite). But I hate how it sometimes turns the lighter highlights near my face blue/grey if left on too long. I try not to apply it to those pieces of hair, but sometimes it bleeds.  When that happens I just mix some shampoo and lightning powder and apply to the blue areas until it fades away, but that is such a pain. Would still recommend for anyone who needs to get rid of that gross yellow/orange after bleaching.</li>
    <li> Used this exactly to the directions and barely toned my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this toner!! My hair looks absolutely gorgeous! I used two bottles with a 10 volume developer since I was only planning to tone, not lift. I was I bit short on product, but my hair is below my waist. Next time I&#x27;ll just use 3 bottles and mix in a little 20 to get a slight lift, but I will probably continue using this for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair background:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally dirty blonde that turns a light baby blonde from the sun (and I get a lot of sun). Well, we have very hard well water, so it would turn my hair orange :(. I tried glosses and a DIY apple cider vinegar toner. They worked, but not for long and it always just masked the brashness. I also used a few rust removers. Nothing stuck and made my hair look half this good.&lt;br /&gt;I got fed up with my hair being so high maintenance that I dyed my hair brown with a demi to be done with it. It looked fine, just after a while it started to wash out, the sun lightened it :/, and ultimately my roots were showing from a mix matched tone, not level. Well I caved and decided to give wella a try after a few vitamin c treatments to remove the dark brown color. I was nervous because my hair wasn&#x27;t technically my &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; anymore. I was a notch below light brown in most parts and light brown on top, but it was still &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; I guess so I figured why not. I was shocked. My hair is an exact match to my natural color. Very very very impressed.</li>
    <li> I used this to tone my rather brassy hair, which was originally black-brown but I&#x27;d dyed ombre. I could tell it had some effect: it paled the yellowness of my hair a bit, but it still looked on the brassy side. I ended up having to use L&#x27;oreal Excellence Cream (Dark Ash Blonde) to finish the process.</li>
    <li> My hair was orangey-yellow. I was going for a warmer platinum. Less than 15 mins of using this toner, my hair was perfect! I like it more than the T16 which didn&#x27;t do a thing to my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair started turning gray a few years ago, with some nearly white areas at my temples and above the ears. I always used Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts light ash blonde and loved it -- but they&#x27;ve changed it so much over the years that it no longer gives me the beautiful ashy blonde that I loved. So I used Clairol&#x27;s Nice &amp; Easy permanent color, and that was a great light ash blonde, but I didn&#x27;t want to keep using permanent color -- too much damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried to find a toner that would make my hair close to the gray that&#x27;s coming, kind of a gray/blonde, if possible, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to tone so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation, I finally found the Wella T14 Silver Lady and mixed it with 4 oz. of 20 volume developer. I&#x27;ve learned to watch my hair during toning -- if it looks dark, I know it&#x27;s going to be too dark. Like a couple of other reviewers said, this stuff works fast! After only 4 minutes, my hair with the toner in it looked darker than I thought it should, so I rinsed it out immediately and used a little bit of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying I was amazed at how gray it came out, no brassiness at all, almost exactly the color of my natural gray. I actually kind of liked it -- but I&#x27;d call the toner Gray Lady, not Silver Lady -- but decided I wanted it lighter, more like what I think silver should be :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to get that lighter, more silvery color, I ordered Wella&#x27;s T18 White Lady, although they&#x27;ve renamed it to Lightest Ash Blonde. If I love that, I&#x27;ll use it with 40 volume to permanently get rid of the remains of the N&amp;E, then use it as a toner every few weeks. Got my fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> Toner worked well and easily with Wella Volume 20 Developer to remove brassy tones left by bleaching.</li>
    <li> I used this toner after I bleach/ lightened my hair at home. It turned out a little orange but after using the wella toner my hair was a nice light brown/ dark blond color. Great product as it was under $10. Shipping was fast. I purchased two more times, would not bleach my hair again without following up with this toner.</li>
