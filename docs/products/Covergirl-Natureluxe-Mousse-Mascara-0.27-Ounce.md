      <li>The results aren&#x27;t amazing, it&#x27;s more for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking makeup style, but anything that I can wear without my eyes puffing up is a win in my book.</li>

      <li>This is the best one coat mascara I have ever used...and if you go for a 2nd or 3rd coat you are gonna get the longest lashes ever...and each one is separate...not globbed together or spidery looking.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often buy makeup on Amazon but wanted a more gentle and more natural looking mascara.</li>

      <li>All this does not make this mascara worth its price...</li>

      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>It stays true all day long and is easily removed at night.</li>
      <li>Bought this mascara for my daughter, who has naturally long  lashes, just to give them some more ooomph.</li>
      <li>Pretty much everything I want in a mascara.</li>
      <li>If you want a big, bold, super voluminous mascara then don&#x27;t get this</li>
      <li>It covers well and does not clump if you start with a clean eyelash, and don&#x27;t try to go back and give more coverage later.  </li>
      <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>not too much then this is for you.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m thrilled that they have the color black brown!</li>
      <li>I decided to choose this mascara as it is more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than some of the other choices.</li>
      <li>Looks like this will be my new go to mascara!</li>
      <li>very natural looking!</li>
      <li>Goes on light, but it build-able for a more dramatic look.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but so far I really do like it!!!  </li>
      <li>Only on rare occasions do I end up with a little clump that is easily combed/brushed away.  </li>
      <li>It lives up to its promises, but it&#x27;s a pretty standard mascara.  </li>
      <li>I like this mascara because it is natural and it doesn&#x27;t make my eye lashes fall out.</li>
      <li>It goes on naturally, clump-free, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>This brush is to soft.  </li>
      <li>when i saw that it was discontinued i went to other stores including Mac to see what other similar products exist and they were all $20 or more.</li>
      <li>She was so sad when we could no longer find this in local stores, but thanks to Amazon, she has a year&#x27;s supply :)</li>
      <li>She is blonde and prefers a natural look, so loves the black/brown shade.</li>
      <li>Regardless of how many layers I apply, it does anyway look too thin on my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t turn my eyes red and itchy.</li>

<li> You have to press to hard on your lashes and when you do that you end up using to much product, and it clumps.  </li>
<li> I was getting pretty tired of going to the mall and spending $25-$30 for mascara that didn&#x27;t perform as promised.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it because this one drawback isn&#x27;t enough to send me looking elsewhere, and every bad ingredient I can live without is a positive for me.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as other mascaras I have tried.</li>
<li> yeah, it contains some natural ingredients, but it also contains some unnecessary synthetic ingredients, which as I assume are used to preserve natural ingredients and which can be irritating to eyes.</li>
<li> I can build up my lashes a little or a lot depending on my mood and hey no clumping.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like washing my face with harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> After struggling with multiple mascaras (some expensive and some drugstore-priced) affecting my allergies, my co-worker suggested I try this.  </li>
<li> it seriously just glides on.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Cover Girl has discontinued this product and Amazon was one of the few places I can find it.</li>
<li> i hate mascara that requires heavy duty make up remover to get off.</li>

    <li> This is a wonderfully light, lengthening mascara. And a great color too! A good quality product, just like you would expect from Cover Girl.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t turn my eyes red and itchy.

    <li> I was getting pretty tired of going to the mall and spending $25-$30 for mascara that didn&#x27;t perform as promised.  I thought this price was worth a try....and omg!  What a surprise!  This is the best one coat mascara I have ever used...and if you go for a 2nd or 3rd coat you are gonna get the longest lashes ever...and each one is separate...not globbed together or spidery looking.  It&#x27;s as they promised...very natural looking! Love this product.  I&#x27;ve already signed up for regular delivery to get an even better price and the luxury and convenience of always having a fresh mascara at the ready!!</li>
    <li> great product, all natural, looks great on. people ask me and i tell  them cover  girl is the best to buy</li>
    <li> I am surprised that the ratings are not higher. I love the brush and consistency of this mascara. I can build up my lashes a little or a lot depending on my mood and hey no clumping. I purchased brown-black. I am a redhead and would tend to want brown but it was more expensive. The black brown  looks natural too. I don&#x27;t often buy makeup on Amazon but wanted a more gentle and more natural looking mascara. This is it!</li>
    <li> I decided to choose this mascara as it is more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than some of the other choices. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  It lives up to its promises, but it&#x27;s a pretty standard mascara.  It covers well and does not clump if you start with a clean eyelash, and don&#x27;t try to go back and give more coverage later.  If you apply over old mascara, or do a second coat, it begins to get fairly clumpy.

    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not only does it not make my lashes break, it actually helps them grow!  An  anesthetist asked me about my long lashes on a cruise just recently. Unfortunately, Cover Girl has discontinued this product and Amazon was one of the few places I can find it.</li>
    <li> I really liked how light it is when I put it on. I also love how it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, I&#x27;ve had problems with this before because my eyes are sensitive. If you want a big, bold, super voluminous mascara then don&#x27;t get this but if you&#x27;re looking for just a bit so it looks like you&#x27;re wearing something but not too much then this is for you.</li>
    <li> i love the texture of this mascara. it seriously just glides on. never chunky and gives good coverage with a natural look. it comes of very easy with just water. i hate mascara that requires heavy duty make up remover to get off. this is not the case with this one. for the price, it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the softest mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried! It glides on with a rich texture that isn&#x27;t clumpy or crumbly. It stays true all day long and is easily removed at night. I&#x27;ve used this brand for a while and really love it.</li>
    <li> After struggling with multiple mascaras (some expensive and some drugstore-priced) affecting my allergies, my co-worker suggested I try this.  It&#x27;s great!  It goes on naturally, clump-free, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying my mascara.  It&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump, and is easy to apply!  The wand is made out of plastic (instead of bristles) and I like that too.</li>
    <li> This brush is to soft.  You have to press to hard on your lashes and when you do that you end up using to much product, and it clumps.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Regardless of how many layers I apply, it does anyway look too thin on my eyelashes. And I do not like the formula: yeah, it contains some natural ingredients, but it also contains some unnecessary synthetic ingredients, which as I assume are used to preserve natural ingredients and which can be irritating to eyes. All this does not make this mascara worth its price...</li>
    <li> Bought this mascara for my daughter, who has naturally long  lashes, just to give them some more ooomph. She is blonde and prefers a natural look, so loves the black/brown shade. She was so sad when we could no longer find this in local stores, but thanks to Amazon, she has a year&#x27;s supply :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but so far I really do like it!!!  I may even love it at some point, but I don&#x27;t like to rush into using the &amp;#34;l&amp;#34; word.  ;)  Great product and great delivery time!</li>
    <li> For me, this mascara goes on smoothly.  Only on rare occasions do I end up with a little clump that is easily combed/brushed away.  I like that it easily removes with soap and water.  Win-win!!!</li>
    <li> I tried to get this product at the store but turns out they discontinued it. I love it though because i have sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t like washing my face with harsh chemicals. This products comes off with warm water and soap. It stays on great all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 because I don&#x27;t want to move onto another product&lt;br /&gt;PS when i saw that it was discontinued i went to other stores including Mac to see what other similar products exist and they were all $20 or more. So this price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it is natural and it doesn&#x27;t make my eye lashes fall out. It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as other mascaras I have tried. And I&#x27;m thrilled that they have the color black brown!</li>
    <li> Goes on light, but it build-able for a more dramatic look. Doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water. Doesn&#x27;t crumble as the day goes on. COmes off easily in the shower. Pretty much everything I want in a mascara.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
