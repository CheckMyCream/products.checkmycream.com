<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this soap. I use this a few times a week to help unclog my pores. I lather it onto my face and let it soak up the oil and dirt from my pores. Using in the shower is particularly beneficial so that the steam can open your pores. I like the grit in this soap too, I think it really helps in combination with the charcoal in exfoliating. The soap leaves a nice, clean, cool sensation on my skin after i use it as well.</li>
    <li> luscious and oh so refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;THis beautiful to see almost get black bar is like a zen stone but it has the power to create a deep rich creamy soap that nourishes the skin on my face and has just the right amount of light texture to help clean away the days worth of a big city&#x27;s grime.&lt;br /&gt;The lather comes up with just a little rubbing and is this beautiful lavender.&lt;br /&gt;It is rich and refreshing and smells divine.  The peppermint just lingers and as such after the facial washing leaving my skin feeling clean and  tingly.&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves my skin feeling very soft and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I am both pleased and surprised.</li>
    <li> Charcoal is the latest hot ingredient in skin care and it seems like every cosmetic brand - from high-end to drugstore - are rushing charcoal based products to the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dark Angels by Lush which, in my opinion, really sets the standard.  It&#x27;s a great all-round cleanser and exfoliant, but it&#x27;s also kind of expensive so I&#x27;ve been eager to try something at a lower price point.  I recently tried Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal Mask and Scrub which isn&#x27;t too bad and now I&#x27;m giving Biore&#x27;s Charcoal Bar a shot.  First off, it smells like peppermint.  Not a bad thing, but kind of unexpected.  While the bar itself is black, it creates a nice creamy white lather devoid of any grit, so while it might be &amp;#34;penetrating my pores&amp;#34; with the charcoal, it didn&#x27;t really give me that sense.  If I didn&#x27;t know differently it would just seem like a regular, albeit mint-scented, soap.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that my face didn&#x27;t feel tight after rinsing.  While someone with a younger, oilier complexion might like that tight feeling soap usually leaves, at my age it isn&#x27;t very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively for about a week and as a refreshing complexion bar, I give this high marks.  But compared to other charcoal cleansers I&#x27;ve used, it isn&#x27;t particularly distinguished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen more and more products lately that contain charcoal and I&#x27;ve been itching to try them. When the opportunity arrived to try this particular bar, I jumped at the chance. I&#x27;ve used Biore products off and on my whole life, but never really with any regularity. I think I&#x27;ll be using this bar for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the scent was pleasing, if a bit surprising. Once I looked carefully at the ingredients, I located the source: peppermint oil. The smell was pleasant, but I wasn&#x27;t really prepared for the little bit of eye burning that came with it. I know this is common with peppermint oil, so it didn&#x27;t really shock me, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. There&#x27;s no warning on the box about keeping it away from your eyes, which really did surprise me. There probably should be. Some people are more sensitive to the peppermint oil than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love the feeling this bar leaves behind. I keeps my face soft. Even on days when I forget to moisturize, I don&#x27;t get a dry, flaky face. Instead, it stays soft and silky all day, which is SO nice. I am also noticeably less greasy, which I&#x27;m very appreciative of. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in pores or blackheads, but the difference it makes in my skin alone is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month on a daily basis. My pores do indeed seem to be diminished. I have combination skin with an oily T zone.  The bar is a nice size and the shape feels good to hold - it&#x27;s got a rounded triangular shape. It&#x27;s not too soft, so it will last a while. It rubs into a modest lather. The mint provides a refreshing scent and a little tingle on the skin. The bar itself feels nubbly, but the lather doesn&#x27;t seem to have an exfoliating texture. It washes off cleanly with no residue and no excessively tight feeling to my skin. I only use it once a day - more than that can dry out my skin too much.    I&#x27;m a fan and will be restocking when this bar is finished.  EDITED TO ADD: After getting deeper into the bar, there is a gentle exfoliating texture to it.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed that this product has not done any good for blackheads, but acne is more infrequent, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
    <li> Fantastic little bar of soap. It works well with oily skin very well, and doesn&#x27;t over dry. Plus the exfoliation, the ingredients, and the smell are wonderful. Gonna stock up on this one.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product for reducing oily skin and clearing out your pores. The bar smells minty but the minty smell disappears quickly after washing. The bar also has little jojoba beads that act as an exfoliant. The charcoal in the soap is supposed to draw out impurities from your skin. This is really something for my daughter so I asked her for an opinion. She loves it. It leaves her skin soft and makes her skin shine. For my son and me it helped to reduce those nasty blackheads. Even though it is getting rid of the oiliness that leads to the blackheads it doesn&#x27;t leave our skin dry. I think that is from the peppermint oil that has a nice smell without leaving the smell of lifesavers behind. It says that it is for your face but if you have outbreaks on your back you might want to try it there as well. Whether you have a skin problem or not, this soap does a nice job of leaving your skin nice without drying it out. You should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Awesome facial cleanser!  One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes it would help shrink my pores and tone down my oily skin and it hasn&#x27;t done either.  It&#x27;s feels nice and toning and has a wonderful peppermint scent, as well as some exfoliants but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin.  For me, it&#x27;s just a pricey bar of soap.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this soap really &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; as it claims to, I prefer to use a charcoal mask. It&#x27;s sudsy, and on the drying side (I have combo skin). What I really don&#x27;t like about it is that because of the menthol, it stings my eyes, even after I rinse well.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s actually really helping my acne but it smells great and my face feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin loves this bar!  It is soothing and calming to my skin and the light scent doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it.  The bumps on the top of my back are gone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It&#x27;s very easy to us.  It smells great, gives off a peppermint type scent.  The only drawback is that over time it can be a little drying to the skin.  Top off with a nice moisturizer and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I like this bar of soap for three main reasons: 1) its spritely peppermint fragrance (which, thankfully, doesn&#x27;t linger afterward and doesn&#x27;t create much of an aroma when it&#x27;s sitting dry); 2) its attractiveness, like a modern black stone, very interesting to display; and 3) its exfoliation function. Note: The lather is smooth and slippery (on the body and on the tub surface), and I can&#x27;t tell if it \\&quot;drew out\\&quot; dirt/oil from my facial pores. But the bar itself is very rough and exfoliates well when run directly against my skin (arms, legs, torso; it&#x27;s too rough for the face).    I have rosacea and cleanse my face with [[ASIN:B000052YLF Neutrogena Acne]] bar. This lather did not aggravate the rosacea and it didn&#x27;t cause the dryness that Neutrogena can. With its fresh (and fleeting) fragrance, I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in the summer.</li>
    <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive, as in sometimes even tap water and seemingly the air will cause me to break out.  It&#x27;s not at all fun, and makes me wary about trying new face products.  I had heard that charcoal was the new trendy ingredient in such things, and I hadn&#x27;t had any issues using peppermint or jojoba oils on my face, so I felt like I could give this soap a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers pretty nicely - not an extravagant amount, but enough to get to the job done.  The little beads provide a nice, very gentle exfoliation - immediately after using it, my face feels much smoother.  The peppermint kicks in in a hurry in terms of the aroma, and it also serves to provide a nice, cooling, tingling sensation on the skin that lasts for a little while even after you&#x27;ve finished washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the star of the show - the charcoal - and how it is supposed to remove impurities from the pores, my results have been kind of a mixed bag.  I&#x27;ve noticed that some of my pores are smaller, and some blackheads have been cleared away.  However, I&#x27;ve also noticed the emergence of new, relatively large blackheads, too.  I suspect that that could be due to the impurities being purged, and that after a longer period of use (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now), those things will stop cropping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also say that this has not made me break out.  True, sometimes products seem to work on me for a little while, only for breakouts to emerge after a more extended period of time.  At this point, though, I haven&#x27;t seen any indications that this product upsets or aggravates my skin, nor have I detected any signs that make me think it may in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue that I&#x27;ve had with it - and judging by the other reviews, not everyone has this experience - is that it dries my skin out a fair bit.  I have gone from using it every day to every other day, and alternating its usage with the oil cleansing method, and that seems to help.  However, if you&#x27;re starting off with dry skin, I&#x27;m not sure that this wouldn&#x27;t make that issue worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this isn&#x27;t a bad product, by any means.  It&#x27;s worked pretty well for me thus far, and I think it may work even better as more time passes.  If it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and if those pesky new blackheads weren&#x27;t showing up, I would have given this 5 stars.  As it is, I&#x27;m hopeful that at least one of those issues will go away eventually, and it is possible to ameliorate the other problem by not using it on a daily basis.  So, for all those on the fence about trying it, I&#x27;d say to give it a try, and you&#x27;ll likely experience some pretty good results.elp.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Biore Pore Strips for many, many years and have always been pleased with the results. So when I found a new product from Biore, I though I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically the shape of a bar of soap, but almost better curved to fit in your hand. I really enjoyed the smell - subtle, with a hint of peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building a lather was easy, as was properly scrubbing. Rinsing took a bit more time, and there were MANY times I got suds in my eyes. Soap suds are painful, but the suds here were almost more painful - no matter how much I rinsed, I ended up just having to wait out the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the results were fantastic! I&#x27;ve always struggled with slight acne on my chin - using this bar once a day cleans it up brilliantly! And I don&#x27;t find that it sucks all the moisture from my face, leaving me a peeling mess (though I still try to follow up my wash with a good moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the bar. I suppose different skin textures and types might have different reactions, so definitely take care for that, but if you have average skin type, this should work pretty good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S.

    <li> This little bar has really changed my skin care life! I tend to get very bad blackheads on my body and nose. This practically ERASES them! This isn&#x27;t a product to use everyday, but it has really helped me! I even used it lightly on my nose and it gets rid of blackheads there too! (only use on face maybe twice a week) I will be repurchasing for a long time!</li>
    <li> I love most Bior&amp;eacute; products, I use this charcoal bar in the shower everyday on my face (T-zone) and it keeps me from breaking out. I have very oily skin and this bar is gentle enough to cleanse the oil and dirt from my face even in the winter without over drying my skin</li>
    <li> I love this.  Use it to wash my face before bed.  Skin has cleared up.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Used this product for my face for about four months. At night during my shower only, so not twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say if this product is wonderful or not. I switched to a liquid cleanser instead that appears to work just as well, with less drying on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the various Biore cleaning scrubs, I use the Biore pore unclogging scrub every night and now I&#x27;m using the Pore Penetrating Charcoal Bar at the mid-day after working out and doing chores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first charcoal bar and it cleans so nicely, it&#x27;s so refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m noticing much less dirt on my evening cleaning ritual and I feel much better in the afternoon, much cleaner and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now what I will be doing from now on, I don&#x27;t want to be dirty, I prefer clean and refreshed with the jojoba beads &amp; peppermint and the way it makes me feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this soap bar. It&#x27;s shaped to fit your hand and one side is coarse for a better grip. It lathers beautifully and leaves your face feeling smooth and squeaky clean. After only one week, I notice a difference in my skin, it&#x27;s more lustrous.</li>
    <li> Hope springs eternal, I guess.  My skin is not horrible, but clogged pores and stress breakouts are normal and a part of everyday life for me, ever since I was a teenager a few (*cough*) years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a new product appears, something I haven&#x27;t tried, and the old hope reappears.  And again, the new product makes no difference for me.  It&#x27;s probably just me, and if any product has worked for you in the past you might find that this one does, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a soap, this one is kind of nice.  It has a clean smell and a nice rich lather.  When I use it with a face brush it&#x27;s easy to see if I&#x27;ve gotten the brush clean--if there&#x27;s still black soap in the brush, it needs more cleaning.  There is no charcoal residue in my sink or my shower, or on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself feels bumpy, like an exfoliator, but the beads do not remain intact in the lather.  For me that&#x27;s fine, since I have other ways of exfoliating and I don&#x27;t want to overdo it.  It makes the soap a little easier to grip in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after a month of use this soap has not improved my skin-it&#x27;s just as oily, with just as many clogged pores.  But it hasn&#x27;t dried my skin or caused any other problems.  The soap smells and feels nice, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it for as long as it lasts.  For anyone with skin that is not as stubborn as mine, you may have better luck than me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different kinds of charcoal soap and enjoyed them greatly. When I saw that Bior&amp;eacute; had begun making one I thought &amp;#34;Ooh, I&#x27;ll give this inexpensive alternative a shot.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the soap lathers well, and it leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean - but squeaky clean, when it comes to skin, is not a good thing. Squeaky means your skin is verrrrry dry, and as a person with oily skin it takes a lot for my skin to feel squeaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR This soap is overly drying, and leaves skin feeling irritated. Not a great buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have super sensitive skin so I was nervous at first. But I&#x27;ve had no issues with allergic reactions. I Feel and see an immense difference in my skin. My face seems clearer, more even toned and significantly less oily. Absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always had pores in my T-Zone that clogged easily so after reading about this bar in an article I had to try it.  The first time I used it I thought my skin felt great after, it smelled minty so in my mind it had to be clean, right?  Within the first few days I noticed small bumps on my chin but thought they were just the charcoal bringing out the &amp;#34;impurities&amp;#34;.  Now after 1.5 weeks my skin is the worst its been in a long time.  Currently I have white bumps along my jawline, cheeks, and forehead.  Also, I have several bigger pimples on my forehead and chin.  I did not even use the bar directly on my cheeks because my skin is usually pretty clear there but the bumps have set up camp there too.  I only used this bar 4 times but I clearly am having an allergic reaction.  Did anyone&#x27;s skin clear up eventually after similar results?</li>
    <li> I started washing my face with this every night but it seems to dry it out more than anything. My skin is really shiny after using it. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference with my skin except for the dryness afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Marine and have been for some time, all the gear I have to wear rubs my back and creates heat and obviously makes me sweat so I get bad back acne, sadly. But this product does a great job of clearing it up. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This soap has a strong peppermint smell to it and it leaves your face cool and tingling. It does seem to speed up the healing of blemishes, but I only used it once a day as it&#x27;s very strong. When it runs out, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little drying, but cleans well.</li>
    <li> This soap sent me to the emergency room. I showered with it once last week, scrubbing my entire body with it. Over the course of the rest of the week, scabby breakouts randomly popped up over my body. I also had a strange night where I couldn&#x27;t seem to get these tiny black lint splinters out of my hands, but I never made the connection. A week later, I showered with it again, scrubbing all over. The next day, my face was puffy and inflamed, stinging and burning and there were dark solid pieces of something imbedded in my skin. I broke out everywhere, black marks and discoloration and even pus pimples that appeared within 10 minutes. Upon close inspection of the bar of soap, I discovered sharp wire-like pieces of charcoal throughout. After a painful few days and two urgent care visits before an ER visit, I am sitting here typing this review with splinters of charcoal imbedded in my skin from head to toe. There is a large chunk of it the size of a pea in my chin that stings every time I move. These splinters bubble in water, causing my skin around them to bleed and sting and pus. They are up to a few millimeters deep in my skin where I washed the most and all I can do is wait for them to come out, washing my sheets every night, since they break down into pieces that look exactly like tiny little black lint. I&#x27;ll post pictures later today, as I&#x27;ve been so dehydrated and in so much pain that I just returned to work. Biore will be hearing from me about this.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s face started clearing up within a few days of use!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that seems to improve with use.  I have used it numerous times since receipt and find it more enjoyable after each use.  I was a bit wondering after the first wash or so due to the charcoal but have found it to be much better after each use.  It is a good size and while it does sometimes leave a black substance on the wash stand it cleans up nice and overall I find it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has jojoba beads and peppermint and leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean.  It does leave your skin feeling tingly smooth and I would recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> The peppermint is awesome!  When I opened this black soap bar I wasn&#x27;t expecting the peppermint (didn&#x27;t read the whole description), and it feels great.  It takes very little to do the job and should last a long time.  It is a very gentle exfoliator, so use a washrag etc. if more is needed.  It does leave my face feeling a little dry after use, but to the touch it feels good.  It does seem to clean well.  I always break out after wearing makeup, so washed with this and had less of a reaction than usual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally not a fan of switching facial cleaning products, especially when the product I&#x27;ve been using for a long time works very well. The funny thing about change is that unless your willing to step outside your comfort zone, you will never know what the world has to offer. Enter the Biore pore penetrating charcoal bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long time user of Anthony&#x27;s red clay mask for keeping my pores clear, I always disliked the red clay mess and staining of white towels associated with cleaning up. The Biore bar is light years better in so many ways. There is zero to little mess, no staining of towels, and it leaves my skin glowing and vibrant. Pores have shrunk leaving skin looking more smooth and clear. I generally use about 2-3 times a week and have not experienced dryness, or irritation.  Highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about two weeks now. My first observation was that I really like the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; which is very faint. The bar is black, which at first worried me because I was concerned it might stain my shower. But when you lather it, the soap turns nicely white. The description on the box touts textured charcoal within the soap, but while you can feel a bit of texture while rubbing the bar to work up a lather, the lather itself seems very smooth. This isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; kind of soap, it&#x27;s actually just nicely soothing and kind to your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Cleans skin very well and leaves no oil behind</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this product. It makes my skin feel clean and tingles a little, in a good way. I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin, but i suspect those who do might have some issues with that. I have oily skin, so drying out my face is well... wanted. I haven&#x27;t experience a problem with that where I would reduce usage like the instructions say for that reason. Thee instructions say to use the foam to wipe your face, but then I don&#x27;t really seem to get the exfoliating as much. I like this enough to try a liquid form to see if i like it better, but I do like the bar soap.</li>
    <li> This scrub has been great for my 40yr old skin.  I still break out occasionally despite having normal/to/dry-ish skin especially in the winter.  I like this scrub because it doesn&#x27;t have too high a concentration of the scrubbing bits.  My skin feels nice after using it, and is not too dry like some anti-break-out products.  The fragrance is also delicious - I think of peaches, mangoes, and blackberries when I use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I can feel a definite difference in my skin after using it.  It definitely  opens the pores and the skin feels truly clean and fresh.  I use creams to moisturize my face as I have been on an anti aging campaign  for the past 4 months.  This product fits right in to my program due to its fantastic cleaning of the skin and pores.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Works well, but a bit abrasive for my skin. I have somewhat sensitive skin and my skin tends toward the dryer side so this isn&#x27;t for me. Made my face peel-y. My husband has oily skin and he loves it. So, if you have oily skin this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed as I have aged, (50) my pores are much more noticeable, and clog easier as well. I love Biore products, so I didn&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try. First of all, it is an excellent value, the cleanser is much larger than it appears in the picture, it creates a very rich lather  easily, and with little effort, plus the bar itself seems to be lasting a very long time.I did not personally notice much of a scent but it delightfully makes my skin tingle, and is a great wake-up tool.It rinses off easily, and believe it or not, my face actually feels like it is &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; ! It allows me to apply my make-up to a truly clean slate. I am absolutely thrilled with this cleanser, and I follow it up with Biore toner for a completely fresh start to my day.I also use Biore wipes to remove my make-up every evening. Despite my age, I am still quite acne prone, but since using this pore cleanser, that has not been an issue whatsoever. This complete collection is so reasonably priced, with many different options available for all types of skin problems. Biore products will be my daily requirements for a very long time, I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Read my other reviews for a greater product</li>
    <li> This bar leaves my fave with a clean, tingling feeling!! It&#x27;s a little drying so I only use it once a day. The bar seems to be lasting forever too!</li>
    <li> i absoulutly love anything biore</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before I tried it.  One reviewer said it broke them out.  Well, they weren&#x27;t kidding.  It broke me out as well...and I used it for 2 weeks and no change.  It seemed to leave my entire body feeling refreshed and squeaky clean feeling, but broke me out quite a bit.  I usually have blackhead prone skin with some blemishes here and there, but not a lot.  This bar broke me out very badly.  It really helped with my t-zone area and clearing the blackheads when I paired it with a facial scrub brush, but other than that it was no good for my face.  The body however, is a different story.  It left my skin feeling very soft.  I liked it overall just not the way it broke my face out.  I will add, that it also got rid of my Poison Ivy/Oak that I am fairly allergic to.  I usually cannot get rid of it for over a month, and this stuff calmed it down within 2 weeks.  It seemed to relieve the itching quite a bit as well.  I read somewhere that it is due to the peppermint oil in it.  Either way, that was nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: for me, I will not buy it again until the price drops OR I have another reaction to poison ivy.  I can buy other soap/body wash for the same price that lasts much longer.  Gave it 3 stars because to me--it is very overrated and overpriced.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful.  It worked great on my teens oily skin.  Within a few days my son&#x27;s skin was clearer and had substantially less breakouts.  In addition, it left his skin feeling clean without any residue.  I&#x27;m impressed with the results.  A few people commented &amp;#34;that his face looked clearer&amp;#34;  The peppermint scent is also really relaxing.  I will definitely repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have seen many cleansers now have charcoal in it and this is the first time using a product with charcoal.  The bar smells good - kinda minty- and it lathers really well.  The soap doesn&#x27;t leave any film or sticky residue on your face.  So far, so good.  After a couple uses my face started to break out.  I continued to use it just to see if the &amp;#34;pore penetrating&amp;#34; qualities were extracting the oils and dirt from my skin and my face would eventual come back to normal.  Well, after a week of use, my face continued to have pimples.  I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore because apparently it was not helping my skin.  Maybe it was just my skin type, but now I am turned off from charcoal products.</li>
    <li> I am loving this bar.  It smells fantastic like peppermint and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  After three days of use, I have noticed a reduction in blackheads.  It&#x27;s worth the price and the bar should last a while.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for about three weeks and likes it well, but not quite five stars worth. No problems, per se, but she is just OK with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Interesting looking, black soap with a nice oblong shape that is easy to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;* Cleans nicely on her skin (she&#x27;s 18) and seems to remove some (excess) oil from her skin.&lt;br /&gt;* The charcoal granules embedded in the soap add a bit of exfoliant capability. It is not intense, though. She uses other exfoliant products and this one will not replace them (e.g. apricot pit granule wash, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Takes a while to expose the granules. She was using it every day for almost a week before it was working well as an exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;* You may not like black colored soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;We all think it was a nice thing to get as an evaluation sample but probably won&#x27;t go buying it.</li>
    <li> It was a bit strange having a black bar of soap to clean my face with, but once you get past the look and shape of the bar, all is well.  There is some peppermint oil in the soap, which gives the skin a tingling feel while using it and a few minutes afterwards.  It&#x27;s a nice tingle.  The peppermint oil opens your pores allowing the charcoal to do it&#x27;s part.  Charcoal is used to help pull things out of other things (put some charcoal in a smelly area such as a car, and it absorbs the odors), so this helps to draw blackheads out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and using this daily dries my skin out a bit too much, so I switched to every other day - perfect.  It&#x27;s enough to keep my pores looking healthy and unclogged - meaning I don&#x27;t notice my pores anymore!</li>
    <li> I like using this on my face. It leaves a cooling &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; tingle on the skin. Skin feels very clean after use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was a bit taken aback by the color when I first saw it. The soap is black. But it leaves my skin feeling tingly and clean. The triangular shop fits my hand well. I have had no whiteheads since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap! the smell and the way my face feels afterwards is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This is the deep penetrating charcoal bar, sort of like a black soap with exfoliating beads. It has a light peppermint scent, not too strong or overpowering. I use this twice a day as instructed and so far I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was originally looking for something to clear out my pores. This didn&#x27;t really do that for me but it clears up my face right away. I tried the liquid wash but that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything and my face got a few pimples from the lack of effective product. After using this product once or twice my face clears right up so now whenever a different face wash I try breaks me out I can always count on this to clear my face up.</li>
    <li> Seriously charcoal is the best thing I have discovered in beauty.  After using this just one time my breakout was gone, not reduced gone!  My blackheads are greatly reduced again after only one use.  I don&#x27;t know if this is something I could use every day since I have super sensitive acne prone skin but a few times a week is really helping me.  I also can not say enough good about the biore charcoal warming mask which I bought as well.  Not only do those feel amazing when you put them on they only have to stay on for 1 minute.  Who doesn&#x27;t have one minute.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months. It cleared up my skin at first but for the last month it has caused pimples, larger, clogged pores, and blackheads.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and not too messy so far, this bar dries my oily sensitive skin while refreshing it. It has especially worked well on my blackhead prone nose.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to see this type of bar for such a low price compared to similar charcoal bars that are three times the cost.  This product works well to deep clean acne-prone skin.  However this bar can be harsh on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It worked much better for my son.  He has struggled with moderate breakouts all of his teens.  His skin looks much better since washing daily with this bar.  As for me, it is too harsh.  I have sensitive skin, and it seemed to make me break out more.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact I *knew* this was soap, I was still a little wary that I might actually be opening a bar of black coal and scratching my face up with it. I didn&#x27;t know if it would foam, or if I&#x27;d have to have a special sponge to use it, etc. However, it&#x27;s really just a bar of soap that is tinted black and contains very fine charcoal powder and &amp;#34;scrubbing beads&amp;#34; to really clean your skin. It foams up nicely and leaves skin feeling very clean and tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of sunblock and sometimes it can be hard to get it off my skin with facial soaps, and the gentle ones really do nothing for my skin when I have any kind of lotion on it that I want to get off. This bar did a great job of cutting through all the sunblock gunk and getting my skin clean and primed for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, or want a gentle cleanser, this is probably not a great choice. It does strip your skin quite a bit.  But if you like a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, this is the facial soap for you.</li>
