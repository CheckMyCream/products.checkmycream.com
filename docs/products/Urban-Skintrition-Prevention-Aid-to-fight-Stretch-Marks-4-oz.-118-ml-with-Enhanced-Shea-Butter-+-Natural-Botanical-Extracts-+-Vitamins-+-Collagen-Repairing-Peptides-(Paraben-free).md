### Positive Reviews

      <li>Revitagen FX was the best I have ever used, but I think they may have changed their ingredients because it doesn&#x27;t work like it once worked, Revitagen FX took about 70 % of my marks away!  </li>

      <li>: This is the first review I ever wrote in my life, so forgive the writting :)</li>
      <li>I found Jason&#x27;s vitamin E oil was much more effective (also sold here on Amazon and at a fraction of the cost of Urban Skintrition).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just don&#x27;t buy it thinking it&#x27;s magical ;)</li>
      <li>As a part off full body care routine does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I decided to try something different, thinking I would have a good result</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Since I got pregnant</li>
      <li>However, i&#x27;m going to try and be more strict with my new batch of this stuff</li>
      <li>, if you have extra money buy it and make your own review</li>
      <li>I know it sounds like an effort, but it&#x27;s really worth</li>
      <li>, i saw no improvement on my stretchmarks, i bought it because all the great reviews it had, but it only leaves your skin soft and moisturized but the stretch marks did not improve.</li>
      <li>Great small, live the skin smooth</li>
      <li>I was very petit before fall pregnant with twins.</li>
      <li>I find the scent to be pleasant and not too heavy.  </li>
      <li>I tried so many cream out there, but finally I started using this cream, the coconut mango,</li>
      <li>I have definitely have noticed that they are not as prominent as before.</li>
      <li>The cream is thick and smells great.</li>
      <li>I tend to try to spread it as much as possible then leave it alone despite still being able to see the cream.</li>
      <li>It let your skin so soft, so smooth.</li>
      <li>I think the first jar I had lasted me about 2-3 months.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product several times and am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>if it works on old stretch marks but it works like magic on new ones.</li>
      <li>a stretch mark cream works just as good as more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>Now, for my stretch marks on my hips that aren&#x27;t deep but bright red, this cream doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much except for keep the area moisturized.</li>
      <li>Having a baby shouldn&#x27;t mean saying good bye to a pretty body.</li>
      <li>Despite very frequent use I did not get any noticeable improvement on the many stretch marks I have on my thighs, as a result of constantly gaining and losing weight over the years.</li>
      <li>Great as a moisturizer, very thick but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian and my skin quite light</li>
      <li>I even went to my dermatologist and the bleaching cream she provided didnt do as much as this cream.</li>
      <li>so I dont see much of an improvement</li>
      <li>It wont make them disappear, that&#x27;s what we all want really.</li>
      <li>and I used this stuff the whole time.</li>
      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t really do much for stretch marks once they&#x27;re there</li>
      <li>, I grew about 1 whole foot.</li>
      <li>so my stretch marks is very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also wait a few minutes (10 mins) before putting clothes on to make sure that the product has been absorbed.</li>
      <li>I normally dont go for coconut scents (smells too much like sunblock) but combining it with mango</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing a new container of this stuff after xmas is over and can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
      <li>so I gained so much weight that I started seeing stretch marks on my sides, new ones on my thighs and butt.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Im new to amazon</li>
      <li>First of all, they&#x27;re not as deep anymore</li>
      <li>so smooth &amp; stretch marks are fading i highly recommend it everyday</li>
      <li>and i would recommend it to anyone who has old or new stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Then I got some deep and bright red stretch marks on my lower stomach area due to my son getting real big at the end</li>
      <li>This is a luxurious cream that absorbs completely into the skin.</li>
      <li>This might make them fade a tiny bit after using the whole bottle</li>
      <li>so i was surprised how well it took them away.</li>
      <li>The cream is so rich that a little bit goes a long way, so one 4-oz jar lasts for a whole month.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this stuff like all other stretch mark creams really doesn&#x27;t work guys. It wont make them disappear, that&#x27;s what we all want really. This might make them fade a tiny bit after using the whole bottle but when it runs out your money was basically just wasted. Do not recommend this item</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy &amp; soft a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks no change in my stretch marks yet. Smell is light &amp; tropical.</li>
    <li> I have embarrassing stretch marks all over my butt and upper thighs from puberty which are sadly quite deep. Before using this stuff I was using bio-oil with absolutely no results whatsoever.  Then I bought this stuff and let me tell you, this stuff is AMAZING. I started noticing a difference just after a couple days of use! Where the stretch marks weren&#x27;t as deep are almost completely unnoticeable while where they are a little deeper I have definitely have noticed that they are not as prominent as before. I did not stick to using this stuff as constantly as recommended (used it once or twice a day only a couple times a week instead of every day) but I still got some pretty great results! I will be purchasing a new container of this stuff after xmas is over and can&#x27;t wait to use it again! I think the first jar I had lasted me about 2-3 months. Also, this stuff absorbs well and is not greasy at all like bio-oil is.  Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on the stretch marks on my upper thighs unlike I have with the ones on my butt. However, i&#x27;m going to try and be more strict with my new batch of this stuff and hopefully that will help. This stuff is amazing! GIVE IT A TRY!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything. probably I needed more time???, if you have extra money buy it and make your own review</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. it does keep your skin moist, but it doesn&#x27;t correct anything. it&#x27;s too expensive for not keeping up with promises</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles at once.. BIG MISTAKE, i saw no improvement on my stretchmarks, i bought it because all the great reviews it had, but it only leaves your skin soft and moisturized but the stretch marks did not improve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very picky person, I like to research the products I use even if it takes me several weeks to finally buy it. I know that there are some fake reviews online, but I&#x27;m a real customer.&lt;br /&gt;I gained over 20 pounds during my exams, I get so stressed that the only thing I do is eat, and so I gained so much weight that I started seeing stretch marks on my sides, new ones on my thighs and butt.&lt;br /&gt;There were very red and itchy, so I searched online for solutions to stretch marks. I read that they can&#x27;t be erased and that lotions didn&#x27;t work. I tried applying cocoa butter, shea butter, vitamin E oil... Palmer&#x27;s lotion.. so many things!! This product is the one you need, I don&#x27;t know yet if it works on old stretch marks but it works like magic on new ones. I have been using it for a month and my stretch marks are almost gone, I can see the difference each week as they get lighter. They also aren&#x27;t itchy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend scrubing every day with a brush, but don&#x27;t be rough! I scrub lightly in the shower and then apply the lotion. I also wait a few minutes (10 mins) before putting clothes on to make sure that the product has been absorbed. I massage it during 1 minute on each zone. I know it sounds like an effort, but it&#x27;s really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I could never go to the beach and feel confident anymore but I know I will be able to :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this NOW!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: This is the first review I ever wrote in my life, so forgive the writting :)</li>
    <li> I came back to edit my review. I believe it&#x27;s a great moisturiser. period. It won&#x27;t really do much for stretch marks once they&#x27;re there but I believe it will prevent them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for it&#x27;s reviews but it didn&#x27;t prevent my skin from getting stretchmarks and it&#x27;s not getting rid of them either. If this cream was as good as it claims to be then it would at least imporve the appearance of my stretchmarks which are not really that bad.  I love the way it feels and smells though, i&#x27;d buy it again just for that. It&#x27;s not bad, just don&#x27;t buy it thinking it&#x27;s magical ;)</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product several times and am pleased with the results. This is a luxurious cream that absorbs completely into the skin. The cream is so rich that a little bit goes a long way, so one 4-oz jar lasts for a whole month.  My skin feels hydrated and smooth (not greasy).  The cream does not cause any itching or irritation. I use the product daily after showering and the hydration effect lasts at least 12 hours.  I find the scent to be pleasant and not too heavy.  The scent does not interfere with any perfume that I wear.</li>
    <li> The cream helped a lot with the stretch marks but with the oil it made it that much more smoother!!! It worked well for me! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have had stretch marks for as long as I could remember. I experienced a rapid growth spurt when i was 12, I grew about 1 whole foot. Ever since then my skin has never been the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products:&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter: is greasy and does nothing but moisturize, did not help at all&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter: helped a tad bit, but not a huge improvement&lt;br /&gt;Derma Roller: seemed to be working, but was too painful to keep of the treatments&lt;br /&gt;Mederma: helped more, but very slowly and was super expensive&lt;br /&gt;Revitol: very expensive, helped some&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product that has a soft smell and seriously works my stretch marks. It has a creamy whipped texture and a little goes a long way. I have noticed a big change in my skin, and I hope with this product there will be a day I will have zero stretch marks. I plan to repurchase soon!</li>
    <li> The cream is thick and smells great. I use this cream after derma rolling and it has the perfect consistency. I will be ordering more as soon as this starts to run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about two weeks or so and I can already see results!  I apply it twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night.  My stretch marks are already getting lighter!</li>
    <li> The cream works. Great as a moisturizer, very thick but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;As a stretch mark cream works just as good as more expensive ones. Miracle cream? No. But nothing is. As a part off full body care routine does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of stretch marks that started to show during my late pregnancy, since I started using this cream nothing new comes out and the old one fade, slowly but steadily. Also happy with the ingredients, very natural solution compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 months now there is no change IT DOES NOT WORK DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
    <li> I loved it. And so do my friends they already see a difference in their stretch marks thank you so much</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about two months and almost all my stretch marks are gone. My stretch marks are about a year and a half old so i was surprised how well it took them away. such a great product and i would recommend it to anyone who has old or new stretch marks.</li>
    <li> a good product. i will have have to continuje inorder to see changes. feels good on m y skin. its oil-free and smells great</li>
    <li> Despite very frequent use I did not get any noticeable improvement on the many stretch marks I have on my thighs, as a result of constantly gaining and losing weight over the years. I found Jason&#x27;s vitamin E oil was much more effective (also sold here on Amazon and at a fraction of the cost of Urban Skintrition).</li>
    <li> Just had my baby and I used this stuff the whole time. Im not sure if stretchmarks are preventable but this kept my skin soft. I used it on my chest, stomach, and top/rear thighs. I never got any stretchmarks.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any improvement, makes skin feel soft, but no changes where expected.</li>
    <li> I chose five stars because this product is amazing! It has diminished my stretch  marks ALLOT and I even started putting it on the scars on my arms and it has started to smooth them out as well. I am extremely happy. I bought two when I ordered and I am totally satisfied. Will be buying more in the future for sure!</li>
    <li> Tried about 5 different products from Amazon for old stretch marks...using reviews to help me. I&#x27;m losing weight, working out....down from 156 to 143. That loose skin In my midsection has been reduced. You have to watch ur diet. I have been using strivectin to tighten the area on sides of tummy where it&#x27;s loose ....and then I use along with that this cream which smells good, goes on nice and seems to be helping my overall stomach even out in texture. The appearance of my stretch marks although light in color are still visible.....these 2 products compliment each other...not sure which one is making the biggest difference. Will continue one more month and give u an update. SM&#x27;s are a problem for sooo many women. Having a baby shouldn&#x27;t mean saying good bye to a pretty body.</li>
    <li> I had a baby boy last august and i had stretch mark all along my side and deep streth marks on the front of my stomach and darks stretch marks on my sides. When i say this cream works it works ive tried everything mederma, bio oil.. ect. Stuff doesnt do anything but this. I even went to my dermatologist and the bleaching cream she provided didnt do as much as this cream. Im new to amazon so i regularly check reviews before buying anything. I LOVE THIS CREAM and i will be ordering another car. YES YES !!</li>
    <li> I thought this product did pretty well with minimizing the feel of my thick stretch marks. They feel softer and less visible in some areas. The product smells nice and I will be purchasing it again for continued use. While no creams can get rid of stretch marks, this cream does make them smoother in my experience.</li>
    <li> So I bought is despite the bad reviews but., i should have taken the hint. I have 3 red stretch marks on my side and I&#x27;ve been using this twice to daily everyday.! Nothing been using it for about a week and a half and I&#x27;m already running out of lotion. The can it came in was very small and very little lotion. I have not seen a difference at all in my stretch marks maybe because., it takes time like 4--8 weeks I don&#x27;t know but., I know one thing that is for sure I will not buy this again. I&#x27;d rather spend 75 dollars on a lotion that has nothing but posititve reviews then spend $25 on this that does nothing. I am 21 years old not sure if age makes a difference but., oh well. It might work for you but didn&#x27;t for me. Copuld have used this money on something else. Bummer....</li>
    <li> it works, but very slowly and when it starts to work the jar is done i never brought another jar  neitha to expensive</li>
    <li> I started using this cream about two weeks before my son was born. I got away with minimal stretch marks throughout my pregnancy until the very end. Then I got some deep and bright red stretch marks on my lower stomach area due to my son getting real big at the end (he was 8 lbs 12 oz at birth). My belly stretched way too fast and then he was born so it went back down too quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream every day to every other day and the appearance of these stretch marks are seeing much improvement. First of all, they&#x27;re not as deep anymore and they aren&#x27;t very red. Little by little they&#x27;re fading away. Now, for my stretch marks on my hips that aren&#x27;t deep but bright red, this cream doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much except for keep the area moisturized. I also started to notice some stretch marks on my boobs from breastfeeding. I started applying the cream to the area and it seems to have stopped them from getting worse, is preventing new ones from forming, and is fading the existing ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cream itself, I like the coconut mango smell. It&#x27;s not too strong and overpowering. When applying the cream, it&#x27;s a bit thick. I tend to try to spread it as much as possible then leave it alone despite still being able to see the cream. After a couple of minutes my body absorbs it all. I would recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> My friend swears by this cream so I decided to try it for myself.  I&#x27;ve only been using this about a week so I dont see much of an improvement but I will continue to use it and report back in a few weeks. I will say that the moisturizing properties are amazing.  It leaves my skin feeling so soft all day long.  Also love the coconut mango scent!  I normally dont go for coconut scents (smells too much like sunblock) but combining it with mango totally freshens it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good..!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Since I got pregnant I had to use stretch marks cream...It was frustrating situation getting rid of them. I tried so many cream out there, but finally I started using this cream, the coconut mango, omg the smell is so good...&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks Im very pleased that &#x27;belly troubles&#x27; began to disappear. It let your skin so soft, so smooth. That&#x27;s a cream that I have to have in my bathroom always... It&#x27;s a great deal. Definitely I will be recommend to my friends.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Yirien Helguera  from Miami Florida..  October 18, 12</li>
    <li> I was very petit before fall pregnant with twins. Stretch marks start to show when i was around 31-32 weeks ( I gained 25lbs). This cream has nice texture, smell lovely and not sticky but it doesn&#x27;t help with my stretch marks at all. I started to use this cream when I was 28-29 weeks but I still got stretch marks everywhere. It was deep purple marks at both side of my belly. 4-5 long brown stretch marks under my belly button. I&#x27;m Asian and my skin quite light so my stretch marks is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I start to do skin dry brushing before shower then I use bio oil and massage it on my belly for 5 mins. My stretch marks start to get lighter!!!</li>
    <li> Way smaller than expected. Should have read the size. Seems like I wont need a lot of product being that it&#x27;s working already!! Smells very nice and I can see a significant change in the texture and tone of  my skin already!!! Love It! Very great customer service as well, they contacted me urgently with my concerns!</li>
    <li> Great small, live the skin smooth</li>
    <li> I so love it &amp; it smells so good + leaves my skin so smooth &amp; stretch marks are fading i highly recommend it everyday use twice a day &amp; u will see them stretch marks fading for shure i love it:)</li>
    <li> I have used creams that work for me Revitagen FX was the best I have ever used, but I think they may have changed their ingredients because it doesn&#x27;t work like it once worked, Revitagen FX took about 70 % of my marks away!  I decided to try something different, thinking I would have a good result if I changed it up a bit &amp; Since this got pretty awesome reviews, I thought I would give it a chance. NOTHING NADA Happened! I&#x27;m going back to Revitagen, however, I suppose that everyone is different. I am skeptical about reviews that ONLY left one for this product. HMMMM</li>
