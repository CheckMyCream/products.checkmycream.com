    <li> Been using it for 20 years!  Need I say more.  I&#x27;m white with thick coarse curly long hair.</li>
    <li> Very thick and makes my hair so soft! Great deep conditioning</li>
    <li> salon products at discount price.  I have dry sometimes frizzy hair and this conditioner is the best.</li>
    <li> Pump broke after a few pumps of use.</li>
    <li> The product itself works great but they sent a pump that doesn&#x27;t go with the conditioner. The last time that happened I didn&#x27;t get one at all. The pump needs to go with the conditioner. Someone please try it before you pack it. I&#x27;d give it 3 stars but I like the conditioner, so the reason for the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a pricey conditioner, yet I&#x27;ve bought four bottles of it. I love how this conditioner leaves my hair. It remains moisturized days after I condition it, and it has a lovely sheen. I think I&#x27;ll keep using this one for a while. Also, the price is much cheaper on Amazon, which is surprising since Amazon usually charges quite a bit more than the stores. I have type 4 natural hair.</li>
    <li> A great product for a great price! It conditions without being heavy/sticky in my fine, silver, waist length hair, and has a pretty/light fragrance. I always have a bottle in my closet and one in the shower.</li>

    <li> Love this product! Actually found it At Tj Max for cheaper than amazon so bought it there. I have course wavy, frizzy hair and it really helps me tame it! You could also leave a tad in as a leave-in-conditioner</li>
