      <li>For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but the wig is fantastic for the price!!</li>
      <li>This wig is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The hair strands don&#x27;t have that plasticy look that you see on most costume wigs from Halloween stores and the strands were thinner and more realistic looking, too.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re into that, have fun!</li>
      <li>I originally ordered this wig for a dance I was doing with my friend in a talent show.</li>
      <li>It very well fits the image of fem!Japan, so in that aspect, I really am pleased.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t yet know if I will cut this wig or not, because I have one in the exact same style already, but any way you look at it, it&#x27;s quite nice,</li>
      <li>Had me worried, at first, but the wait was totally worth it.</li>
      <li>All you have to do is email them, and they get back to you relatively fast, and they are SO nice.</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
      <li>IT  IS EXACTLY AS</li>
      <li>, bangs are not straight, you can see your own hair through, lightly combing with a proper brush causes strands/wig to come apart. .. .</li>
      <li>, I am not that much of a bouncy person, in terms of the wigs I buy, and this wig is VERY bouncy.</li>
      <li>It is a very inexpensive wig, and although I have bought from the seller before, I did not expect this quality.</li>
      <li>As described and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I had to trim the bangs on a few of them due to difference in head sizes, but they looked very realistic and were great quality.</li>
      <li>VERY realistic i was surprised!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The wig has extra space in the back you can use to tuck in your hair and there are adjustment straps along the nape on the inside where you can secure the wig as well.</li>
      <li>Hair is nice,  but wig was thin and sheds as lot.</li>
      <li>Took awhile  to receive due to coming from another country but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>too many wears before it starts to look awfully thin.</li>
      <li>Not a good fit kept moving around even with snap clips and Bobby pins on the wig cap</li>
      <li>I used a few bobby pins as well to be safe, but I&#x27;m really not sure I needed them.</li>

    <li> Beautiful  wig...great quality. Took awhile  to receive due to coming from another country but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Hair is nice,  but wig was thin and sheds as lot. For the price it&#x27;s a good buy. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> A lot shorter than it appears on the mannequin head, bangs are not straight, you can see your own hair through, lightly combing with a proper brush causes strands/wig to come apart. .. .</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this wig. Hair started falling out when I took it out of the package.  Nice color and cut, just not made well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Will wear it in the winter or when running errands. It&#x27;s good for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> The wig was so small it was unwearable.</li>
    <li> a pretty good wig for the price. needs some trimming and styling, but otherwise perfect</li>
    <li> The wig is too short! i expected it to be a tad longer..it barely covers my hair line in the back :(</li>
    <li> It looks great on. For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong. It comes form China, so it smells a bit funky. I sprayed it with perfume to fix that problem. It took two weeks to arrive which was faster than they had estimated.</li>
    <li> Not a good fit kept moving around even with snap clips and Bobby pins on the wig cap</li>
    <li> I bought 15 of these for a group of girls, they worked great. I had to trim the bangs on a few of them due to difference in head sizes, but they looked very realistic and were great quality. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic. It arrived in about 2 weeks from when I ordered it--earlier than the anticipated delivery date, which was great. I got it to top off a Halloween costume and it is by far the best wig I have ever purchased or worn. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased by it. The hair strands don&#x27;t have that plasticy look that you see on most costume wigs from Halloween stores and the strands were thinner and more realistic looking, too. It was also very secure. I have long hair (mid back) and I was able to fit all my hair inside the wig, which was another pleasant surprise. The wig has extra space in the back you can use to tuck in your hair and there are adjustment straps along the nape on the inside where you can secure the wig as well. I used a few bobby pins as well to be safe, but I&#x27;m really not sure I needed them. It was also came wrapped in a hair net, and a wig cap was included in the packaging as well. A very nice surprise.</li>
    <li> PROS: it fit, and it&#x27;s SO sexy. It looks very realistic and stays in place GREAT. Shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: it sheds pretty badly. I doubt it will last me too many wears before it starts to look awfully thin. Also the bangs were WAY too long, down to the tip of my nose. But I trimmed that part and now it looks great.</li>
    <li> Perfect! As described and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> VERY realistic i was surprised! but some of the hair strands fall off</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig about 2 weeks ago. For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but the wig is fantastic for the price!! Seriously!! I wanted to avoid the Halloween rush and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It came in today with the blonde one and I am so pumped. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> IT  IS EXACTLY AS SHONE AND I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> for the money awesome doesnt look all shiny and plastic am looking for more wigs from this company</li>
    <li> Wig is considerably nice. It is a very inexpensive wig, and although I have bought from the seller before, I did not expect this quality. It is thick and bouncy with a bit of weight to it as well (the weight making it feel more realistic).&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am not that much of a bouncy person, in terms of the wigs I buy, and this wig is VERY bouncy. I originally ordered this wig for a dance I was doing with my friend in a talent show. We were cosplaying as fem!Japan and fem!China from Hetalia. It very well fits the image of fem!Japan, so in that aspect, I really am pleased. But I could not see anyone dancing in this wig without it flopping over into their face and obscuring their vision. If you&#x27;re into that, have fun! But that&#x27;s my only real complaint for this wig, and that gave it four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;Nice, natural black, color. The wefts are evenly spaced, and there are alot of them, thank goodness. Minimal weft can be seen through the hair due to that, and the fact that the cap is black. The bangs DO come a little long, but that enables you to cut it to where it favours your face shape and length the most.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t yet know if I will cut this wig or not, because I have one in the exact same style already, but any way you look at it, it&#x27;s quite nice, actually.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is great. All you have to do is email them, and they get back to you relatively fast, and they are SO nice. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;This wig came a bit later than the rest of my orders, which all came from China and through the standard handling service in my country. It usually takes up to two weeks for these wigs, specifically, to arrive, and this wig came in about three weeks. Had me worried, at first, but the wait was totally worth it. ^_^&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely continue to buy from the Mapofbeauty seller. (3 wigs and counting!!!)</li>
    <li> Very nice, it sheds a lot And I had to cut the bangs. But other than that it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
