      <li>It is cool, refreshing and clears up your skin almost immediately.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was recommended this mask at a spa, and it&#x27;s way cheaper here. Took a while to come, but it was worth the wait. I use it once or twice a week. It brightens my complexion, making my skin baby soft. Great for sensitive skin too. I actually used it while on Accutane. I especially love it during summer as it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have rosacea and it calms and refreshes my skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> The product I received was not sealed. Additionally, when I opened the jar I did not receive a full jar. For the price I paid I should not have had product missing and the jar not be completely full.</li>
    <li> Product works great, but I&#x27;m unsure if it is really an Eminence product. Similar to other reviews, the seal was broken on my jar, there was just a topper that slid off. My product also had small bits of what looked like cucumbers and seeds. I&#x27;m not sure if that is normal for this product or not, but seemed a little sketchy to me.</li>
    <li> Very good masque, I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the skin soft and clean without over drying it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helped with break outs.</li>
    <li> Really fabulous.  I saw this on The Today Show... Co-anchor Tamron Hall uses it EVERY morning and her skin is absolutely flawless.  The product smells really earthy and organic... turns very cool and refreshing on your skin.  I love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Eminence ( a great, although somewhat pricey, organic line of products found primarily in spas) has a line called \\&quot;Clear Skin Probiotic\\&quot;. Of the line of products, the Clear Skin Probiotic Masque is the best product in my humble opinion. What I love about the mask is that it is for oily to normal skin that is blemished; however, it is not drying at all. The mask itself does not even dry on your skin during the application, it stays wet the entire time. Its consistency is like that of yogurt, and contains lactic acid. So, while it helps with oily or blemished skin it is also moisturizing. The mask feels cooling and refreshing on the skin.  It is not irritating and its not drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from yogurt and lactic acid the formula also contains cucumber (great for purifying and shrinking pores),  shea butter (an emollient), marigold (anti-irritant and antiseptic), kaolin clay (draws out impurities), stone crop (anti- inflammatory), tea tree oil (antiseptic), and an antioxidant booster of vitamins A, C, E and Coenzyme Q10. The probiotic line also includes a cleanser, which I honestly don&#x27;t recommend buying (to come in another review), and a probiotic moisturizer (the jury is still out on this one). I do love the mask though and have already replaced one container that I already used until it was empty (the ultimate test of a great product!) For more reviews visit us at pimples and wrinkles. And be on the lookout for the launch of our new pimples and wrinkles site which will have Spa reviews, Treatment reviews, and Product reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this masque. I use this one in the middle of the week and use the Blueberry Soil Repair Masque on the weekend.</li>
    <li> I got a facial at a spa one day and they highly recommend these products. This masque feels amazing and it works wonders for my skin!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough. I am 42 now with hormonal acne.  I also live in Hawaii, so my skin care needs are way different after moving from Oregon.  I use it every night now on my chin area and cheeks, and just leave it on overnight.  I wake up with no redness and the acne reduced,  not gone, but as good as possible  I have terrible dry red bumpy irritated reactions to differin or retin a and even retin a micro so this is the best for me and never turns my skin  red or dries out my chin area.  I have added in the herbal spot serum, but that isn&#x27;t as noticeably helpful.  Still no irritation or redness.  I use the probiotic cleanser with the clarisonic mia and delicate brush morning and night.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this mask!  It smells like cucumber &amp; yogurt and feels cold and tingly on your skin.  Not only does it feel good, it works.  It makes my skin feel tighter, more moisturized, and it helps heal breakouts more quickly which is the reason I bought it.  I use at least once a week, sometimes twice, and leave it on about ten minutes.  I alternate this mask with the Eminence Pear &amp; Poppy Seed Microderm Polisher which is also great.</li>
    <li> It is so much cheaper than the spa, and it is definitely real and authentic. I would come back again. &#x3D;) btw it helps with breakouts for sho !</li>
    <li> My first time trying this masque and love this product. My face feels like i have been to a spa. It was my first time using Eminence and I am a believer. Delivery was on a Sunday which was totally awesome. I can&#x27;t wait to try the ither products.</li>
    <li> Helps clear current breakouts and inflammation and staves off new out breaks. As I recently learned, this is a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; masque so you feel it warm and tingly on your skin as it dries, which I love.  I been using this 1-2 times per week for 2 months and have never experienced any sort of irritation or sensitivity to this product.  I&#x27;ve read reviews from others that they sleep in this masque.  I did this once and it was fine, but I just didn&#x27;t like the idea or feel of having it on my face while I laid on my pillow.  I do usually keep this masque on for 15-30 minutes or more.  I often put it on and then go about doing other things around the house.  I work from home, so will leave it on and take calls or answer emails for a bit before washing it off.  My skin feels very refreshed after using this masque.</li>
    <li> This mask was used on me at spa, it was so wonderful I had to purchase!... When I went to the spa my face was in \\&quot;really bad breakout\\&quot; mode, and this stopped and cleared up everything!  I was going to a wedding in two weeks and I ordered this because I wanted to look great.  Unfortunately it came a few days AFTER the wedding... so it was a little disappointing but I am glad to have it in my arsenal.  Yes it is expensive but, you don&#x27;t have to use that much so it should last a pretty good amount of time. Plus the results are so worth it. Love this stuff!  Everyone has been commenting on my skin!</li>
    <li> This has been a miracle worker on my sensitive skin with my dermatitis!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I saw results of clearer and smoother skin just after a few usages. I got the cleanser too. I&#x27;ve been using these with the stone crop toner and am really happy. I don&#x27;t know why this picture looks nothing like the product though.  Don&#x27;t be deterred.</li>
    <li> This is a very good masque! I which I could purchase it in bulk!</li>
    <li> Cooling and fresh, this masque clears up any blemishes and pampers my skin.  This is one of my favorite products in the Eminence line.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this, I keep mines in the refrigerator and it seems fresher that way. Masque has a chunky consistency, but feels super cooling especially on hot Summer days. Give your face something good to eat with this product!</li>
    <li> I love the tingling sensation of this mask. You can literally feel it working! I have super sensitive skin and this helps clean and calm my skin.  I alternate it with the eminence Hibiscus and Calendula mask every week to help clear up my complexion and keep my pores clean.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but I think this its actually shrinking my pores!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this mask and it works great. I have adult acne and this helps clear my skin to a great extent. Just a tiny bit of it can go a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for anyone with problematic skin. Non-irritating, soothing and detoxifying. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice a week. I like to exfoliate straight after for a great result.</li>
    <li> I purchased this masque &amp; the Probiotic Face wash at the same time.  It was used on my skin during a facial at a high-end spa &amp; was suggested as a gentle product which would help reduce my acne and skin irritations.  While I found the masque cooling, calming and hydrating, the overall long lasting effects weren&#x27;t what I was hoping for.  I still use it periodically to give my skin a little refresher but after having used the products together for several months, I saw little to no improvement.  I really wanted to like this skin care line but unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be spending the money to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I loved this mask. It was tingly and made my skin feel fresh after washing it off. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was using Aveeda products but aesthetician at a spa used these products and gave me a sample pack to use overnight. I mean literally leave it on overnight and it really does do wonders for the skin. Don&#x27;t worry- it sinks into the skin so it will not mess up sheets. Within 3 minutes it&#x27;s really invisible.</li>
    <li> This seller uses eminence jars and fills it will lord knows what. I am a licensed esthetician and have used Eminence for years and this is not Eminence. Do Not Buy From This person. Could be anything inside!</li>
    <li> I have dry combo skin. I like this mask it helps calm breakouts. Does not dry skin out. Leaves it hydrated and feels tingly.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice minty tinging feeling on the skin. Is great for acne-prone skin as it doesn&#x27;t make me break out from using the product directly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product u can feel it working deep and it has a very calm and soothing feeling to it very good on my sensitive skin. Your skin will feel so soft and relaxed after using this!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the quality of this product.  I am anxious to see the results it will render.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am the type who doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin is clean unless it has been scrubbed dry.  The masque goes on super smooth and dries without it feeling too dry.  When I took it off with a warm washcloth, as recommended, my skin felt like I&#x27;d just left the spa.  It&#x27;s been hours since I&#x27;ve used it and my face still feels so smooth and yet moisturized.  All that&#x27;s needed is just a small dab too.  I am so thankful my sister strongly suggested I start using this line!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling tingly fresh! I use this product once a week, and it always leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> The best product line</li>
    <li> Smells great,, honestly only used this item a handful of times,,  but my face has begun to have an allergic reaction,, so I&#x27;d discontinued use.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week! Its feels very refreshing and cooling while on. I believe it helps clear up my acne and I usually leave it on for about an hour! I love this product! I wont ever use another mask!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggles with adult acne since 21. I finally had a facial for the first time a month ago and the esthetician used the Eminence products. I could tell an amazing difference from the first time they were used on my skin. I used to use LUSH Cosmetics Brand face wash, exfoliator, and toning spray before I was introduced to this line and since I got the facial I literally threw all of the lush stuff out and replaced everything with this, probably a 200$ investment, but this stuff WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love this mask, it can be used as a spot treatment overnight in addition to an entire face mask 1-3 times a week. The probiotic moisturizer is probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin and my skin definitely craves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful line</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  It takes the swelling out of pimples and leaves your skin looking and feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This is what Tamran Hall on the Today show recommends as one of her secret weapons. She uses it daily, but I only use it weekly. It is heavenly and makes my skin feel wonderfully smooth. It also has a creamy cucumber mint scent that refreshes your skin. My new favorite. I like it so much that I have ordered two moisturizers from Eminence to try.</li>
    <li> the protective seal came a little bit open but I think it was because of the heat.</li>
    <li> First encountered this product at a 5 star spa and of all the products the specialist marketed to me, this was the one I noted to purchase later.  I had this jar for several months now and it is still in great condition without any refrigeration or special care. I enjoy that it comes with a plastic spatula.  This mask feels cool and tingly on my skin, making me feel like I am balancing the PH and clearing my pores.</li>
    <li> If you have acne all your life, here is something good for you.  I believe no single product can cure anything.  I have stopped eating meat and after while it&#x27;s slowly but surely my face is getting better.  This masque I think it&#x27;s giving me positive impact on complexion and keeps acne for starting up.  Whatever I am doing, my skin is so much cleaner.  I am using this only once a week but so far it&#x27;s best brand I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for all natural face products since I found out I was pregnant. This has added moisture to my face without breaking it out. I love the clean smell! Definitely would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> After wasting hundreds of dollars on this line, I have learned that Eminence products are only meant for spas. They don&#x27;t work on a daily basis for [personal use. They are especially not powerful enough to work on troubled combo/acne skin. When I had bad hormonal breakouts, this expensive masque absolutely did nothing to improve my skin. You&#x27;re better off buying probiotic yoghurt and putting some herbs in it, and applying it on your face. This masque smells and feels great - but that&#x27;s about all it does. I will never buy Eminence products again.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample the first time I used this product and I loved it since. A little tab of this product goes a long way. Once I placed this product on my face and rubbed it, it feels so refreshing and leaves a clean feeling. It gives off a good sting, and you can just tell it does the job.</li>
    <li> If you use this enough, you can probably save money on expensive facials. I love the way this makes my skin feel -- inside and out. I love the ingredients!</li>
    <li> The Eminence Probiotic Masque is simply amazing and works wonders on your face.  I first had this product applied during a facial about 3 weeks ago and decided to purchase it from the salon.  I am a 28 yo male that has fairly combination skin with enlarged pores and blackheads.  After the facial I got from the salon I noticed my skin looked a lot tighter and the pores were visibly shrunken.  Since then I have used the masque once a week for 10-15 mins.  It is very creamy and does not seem to dry the skin out like some other masques, in fact it seems quite hydrating.  The ingredients are all-natural and organic and thus you know you will not be putting toxic chemicals on your face.  The masque goes on whitish and dries clear and so far I have noticed the following benefits:  1) Clearer skin  2) Less visible pores  3) Brighter complexion  4) Hydrated facial skin  5) Overall better complexion</li>
    <li> Great product! My esthetician uses it as part of my facial.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to use in between professional facials!&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived when I expected it.</li>
    <li> Seems to help calm my skin. I get hormonal breakouts (peri-menopausal) and once it starts up it can get out of control quickly. This seems to sooth and calm it down.</li>
    <li> amazing!!! super active and can feel it working! i love the smell and the results are almost immediate, will order again!</li>
    <li> I love all Eminence products. Having used several of their masks, I like this one best for clearing up pimples quickly and keeping blackheads away. It also has a great feel when on - non-itchy and cooling.</li>
    <li> it made my skin look younger I highly recomend this its a mircle worker. I  will use it for the rest of my life, it stopped my skin from ageing. I am 54 and have the skin of a 35 year old woman thanks to this cream</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and oily/combination skin, so I was looking for something that would not clog up the pores. This is an outstanding cosmetic line that is not tested on animals (I am a huge animal fan) and still does the job of clearing the skin. I would recommend using it with the other probiotic products of the same brand to get the best results. Eminence is the only product I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this product..I&#x27;ve been using Eminence products for about 2 years and see a great improvement in my skin. I&#x27;ve only recently started using this particular product but it&#x27;s the bet and my favorite one! Whenever my skin is feeling down and spotty I just put this mask on overnight (as recommended by my aesthetician) and rinse it off in the morning. It dries clear so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being all ghostly or anything. In the morning, my skin is tighter, smoother and any pimples or bumps I have are magically gone. I use it everyday for a week straight before my special time of month and my skin doesn&#x27;t get spotty at all before or during. It&#x27;s fab! It&#x27;s really minty and tingly, but very gentle. I use a really really small amount and mix it with just a tiny bit of water or my stone crop mist and apply on my face either on just certain areas, but often my entire face.  THIS WORKS! I take it everywhere.</li>
    <li> Really works to calm down and clear up problem skin</li>
    <li> I have super weird combination skin and it drives me crazy.  The reason why I like a probiotic mask is because A: it&#x27;s a natural moisturizer and B: it stay on long enough to actually moisturize.  Also, as I get older, my pores are getting bigger, so I need to use masks more often.  I am on a probiotic high now, though.  I just bought a yogurt starter kit and I take these enzymes (link for your convenience) [[ASIN:B00CLPDCAC Probiotics Ultra Blend Supplement - Complete Probiotic Complex With Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum &amp; More - 40 Billion Live Cultures Per Tab - As Recommended By Dr Oz For Men &amp; Women - Safe &amp; No Side Effects - 60 Convenient Tablets (Not Powder Or P...]].  I have bad bouts of IBS which is what got me to look into natural solutions more.  But I did like what the enzymes did so much, I am following the trend! Lol.  Now I am putting it on my face!  What next? :D</li>
    <li> All Eminence products are fantastic, but this one is my favorite! It is cool, refreshing and clears up your skin almost immediately. It keeps my face oil free and moisturized. (Also using the clear skin probiotic moisturizer).  Love it!  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this, I&#x27;ll probably use it forever as part of my skin routine.</li>
    <li> Good overall mask with a refreshing tingle when you put this on. Not sure if they changed the formula but the consistency was more dense and firm than the last one I used (which was more soft and creamy.) would recommend.</li>
    <li> Has helped with my problem skin and added a brightness too</li>
    <li> Outstanding product....LOVE IT!  It is the only skin product I will ever use from now on.  Makes my skin feel super clean and my acne prone 58 year old skin is spotless of acne since I started using it 2 months ago. Best ever!</li>
    <li> OMG this is amazing stuff i put it on my pimples at night and it practically pulls through your skin all the buildup so you can pop it out to heal faster</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the masque.  My skin feels so clean.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product!  I honestly love everything about this mask - nice texture, pleasant fragrance, and easy to apply.  I&#x27;m not sure if the mask truly has the potential to make any long-term changes to my skin, but I can see immediate &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; after applying the luxurious mixture.  My skin feels and looks refreshed -- it actually seems to be brighter, as if it had been polished.  (PS  The mask was recommended by a beautiful TV personality who claims to use it EVERY morning before she goes on the air.)  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It feels very cool when you apply it to your face. I like the feeling. I did see skin get brighter.</li>
    <li> I like it-good if you are acne prone and don&#x27;t want a drying product...</li>
    <li> I put this on and my skin just sucked it up!  It has a nice tingly feeling and leaves my skin soft without excess oil the entire day.  A great product, I will definitely buy again.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> NOT THE REAL PRODUCT. Arrived with seal broken. Eminence products have seals firmly affixed and difficult to remove, not just laying on top. Usually buy Eminence products from local spa, but thought would try this because so much cheaper. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. Different scent and texture from real product- I compared to what I have at home. The real deal is awesome. I love Eminence. This product is not it. Returning mine, along with the other 2 &amp;#34;Eminence&amp;#34; products I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  Everyone I apply it on, loves it. I enjoy it myself.  Great for all types of skin.  A must have !!!</li>
    <li> I actually placed it in my fridge and it feels nice and cool when I put on the mask, which is cool even with the cucumber. I love Eminence line of skin products. Definitely recommend this for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This masque, paired with the herbal spot serum(or any topical treatment) is fabulous. I use a masque twice a week, for my night time regime. I leave it on for about 30 minutes and wipe off. I noticed less inflammation immediately. Then I apply my serum and leave it on overnight. When I woke up in the morning, my breakouts were significantly smaller! You can cleanse/moisturize all you want, but the masques/serums do the real work. I highly recommend this product, and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Rubish!! This &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34; mask made me break out terribly- it looked like I had gotten chicken pox. I am 32 years old and tried the mask to clear up a few minor breakouts. Little did I know it would exacerbate the breakouts immensely. Incredibly over priced. Tea tree oil, listed in the mask as the 10th ingredient, is so minuscule you&#x27;d be better off just buying the oil alone.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> When i received this for my mother the seal was broken. Needless to say we were not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have always had little to no hope with organic products, but this mask has changed my perspective. It doesn&#x27;t dry like a normal mask but this is not a bad thing. It feels minty and yummy on my face and it really clears my face up. :)</li>
    <li> I love eminence. I&#x27;m an eminence junkie. Their stuff loves my skin, and this mask is fantastic. Cold and tingly, smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great masque, cooling and like the fact the product is made from natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> A refreshing, clean scent that truly removes impurities and makes skin more vibrant</li>
    <li> I love how this mask makes my skin feel.  Tingly and clean.  Expensive, but well worth the extra $$.  The smell may be offputting for some, but I like it.  It&#x27;s like a mixture of herbs and cucumber.  The texture is creamy, and it definitely helped shrink the pores on my nose.  I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very minty but not stinging. It&#x27;s hydrating without oils and feels so refreshing on my face! My eyes don&#x27;t water up and I can instantly see how my skin is glowing and soft afterward. Also helps with my acne. I saw them wilt the next day! And did I say it does not turn my skin red angry and flaky dry?</li>
