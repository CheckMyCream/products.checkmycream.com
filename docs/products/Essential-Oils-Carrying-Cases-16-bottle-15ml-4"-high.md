      <li>Liked the case.  </li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m able to safely transport my oils in my purse so that I&#x27;m never without their healing properties!</li>
      <li>There is some room at the top</li>
      <li>I love this case.</li>
      <li>but I also love that one.</li>
      <li>Perfect for holding all sizes of my essential oils!</li>
      <li>It will easily hold 10 ml roller balls, or 15 ml with eye dropper top.</li>
      <li>Love the carrying case keeps bottles in place easy to carry.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen anything better on the market, so,these will do fine for now.  </li>
      <li>Very padded and keeps oils safe!</li>
      <li>It fits several different size bottles, which is great!</li>
      <li>(I also love that they come in so many different colors!)</li>
      <li>Definitely my favorite soft case!</li>
      <li>I love this, It holds all my essential oils, and is easy to carry around.</li>
      <li>filled it with 15 ml bottles and the were a tight fit, but the did all fit and zipped shut.  </li>
      <li>The color does look more red in person than coral.</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this one - neat!</li>
      <li>but that will be an easy fix with little labels on the top.</li>
      <li>I thought it was very floppy.</li>
      <li>and they feel very protected.</li>
      <li>This is the case I bought originally for my Essential oils.</li>
      <li>Price is a bit high, but it works well for traveling.</li>
      <li>I have this case which is 4&amp;#34; high and a plush fabric and a 3&amp;#34; high case that has a cotton fabric</li>
      <li>I bought this when I first started using essential oils, and my only regret is not getting one bigger to hold more oils.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had then more than a few months, so I will add to this review as time goes on.</li>
      <li>You can keep a few sample bottles on top so that you have them on hand to share your oils with people.</li>
      <li>The segments are not pockets, but dividers - meaning that small items will fall to the bottom and be able to move around the case.  </li>
      <li>so I am able to put a small spray bottle and small roll on bottle on top.</li>
      <li>Great little case for E.O.s used for homemade products, holds 16 small bottles.</li>
      <li>When filling it with all 16 15ml bottles it is a tight fit, but they do all go in.</li>
      <li>I love this little case for my essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I knew it was soft</li>
      <li>This holds both my 5ml and 15ml Young living bottles well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick and chunky, but the extra padding will probably keep my bottles from breaking.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic little case for my DoTerra essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I selected the one with the dark interior and am pleased because when I am home I can leave it open and the bottles are still in the dark.  </li>
      <li>This case keeps the bottles in place, they are not loose at all.</li>
      <li>I really like these little carriers.  </li>

<li> This case keeps the bottles in place, they are not loose at all.</li>
<li> I really like these little carriers.  </li>
<li> It snugly holds a wide variety of bottles, including the smaller 5ml bottles, the 10ml roller bottles, the larger 15ml bottles, and even my 15ml spray bottles.  </li>
<li> Keeps the glass jars from bumping into each other, especially with travel.</li>
<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, was the dividers don&#x27;t go all the way down to the bottom of the case.  </li>
<li> The bottles touch each other at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Taller than other cases.</li>
<li> The only complaint is that you have to look at all of them to find which bottle you want</li>
<li> The 3&amp;#34; is too tight even with a mix of 5ml.</li>
<li> The 15ml bottles I have are roller bottles, I do not know if that is why they do not fit in the 30 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I ended up getting rid of it after a few weeks and purchased a hard case.</li>
<li> I am not impressed with the listing color as coral; it is certainly red and not coral.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s very very small and doesn&#x27;t hold shape well.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> Perfect for holding all sizes of my essential oils! and they feel very protected. Extremely happy. The color does look more red in person than coral.</li>
    <li> Color in person looks very different from the picture. It serves it&#x27;s purpose though.</li>
    <li> Love this carrier! Kept my EOs safe from sun and breakage during travel!</li>
    <li> I love this case. It is the perfect size for holding some of my favorite DoTerra oils.</li>
    <li> Love it works great for the 10 ml roller bottles</li>
    <li> I love this little case for my essential oils.  It is very nice!  I leave it on my kitchen counter and before bed I take it to my bedside and get all oiled up for the night.  It is perfect for carrying my oils and keeps them out the light as they should be for better care.  I really like the color of this one - neat!</li>
    <li> The case itself seems like it will do the job.  I am not impressed with the listing color as coral; it is certainly red and not coral.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have this case which is 4&amp;#34; high and a plush fabric and a 3&amp;#34; high case that has a cotton fabric and I like this one MUCH better! The 3&amp;#34; is too tight even with a mix of 5ml. and 15ml. size bottles. This case keeps the bottles in place, they are not loose at all. You can keep a few sample bottles on top so that you have them on hand to share your oils with people. I also have this in the larger case, don&#x27;t remember if it holds 30 or 36 bottles but I also love that one. I would order more and recommend as a gift!</li>
    <li> Great little case for E.O.s used for homemade products, holds 16 small bottles. Keeps the glass jars from bumping into each other, especially with travel. The only complaint is that you have to look at all of them to find which bottle you want but that will be an easy fix with little labels on the top.</li>

    <li> used this for a vacation and was perfect to keep oils safe and organized. Also keeps my favorite oils organized at home!</li>
    <li> This is the case I bought originally for my Essential oils. Now it is the one I store my 15ml bottles in because it is about 1/2 inch taller than the 30 bottle carrying case. The 15ml bottles I have are roller bottles, I do not know if that is why they do not fit in the 30 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again and probably will since my oil collection is expanding.</li>
    <li> Love the carrying case keeps bottles in place easy to carry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of thick and chunky, but the extra padding will probably keep my bottles from breaking.  The segments are not pockets, but dividers - meaning that small items will fall to the bottom and be able to move around the case.  This holds both my 5ml and 15ml Young living bottles well.</li>
    <li> When filling it with all 16 15ml bottles it is a tight fit, but they do all go in. Price is a bit high, but it works well for traveling.</li>
    <li> Liked the case.  Needs to be taller so bottles can be zipped up with droppers in them.</li>
