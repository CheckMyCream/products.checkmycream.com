    <li> I must have 50 colognes but this is the one I use every day.  It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.  Perfect, clean smell, not overpowering.  I&#x27;m down to 1 bottle and going to order a few more.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, but it&#x27;s getting 3 stars because it was shipped without a lid/cap and it already had a bunch sprayed out of it by the time I got it. The box smelled like bottle exploded. I mean... the box even says &amp;#34;Remove safety cap before use.&amp;#34; Mine had no cap! For the price, where the hell was the cap?</li>
    <li> I order it  for my son by Amazon, and the price was very lower that any department store!!&lt;br /&gt;That was the best gift, for good  price for him!!</li>

    <li> This is hands down the best smelling cologne I have ever sprayed on my body. It&#x27;s pricey, but WELL worth the cash. Definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> Price was SO MUCH less than Macy&#x27;s--and at other fine store  got 2 the amount as fine dept store for less money!!</li>

    <li> Smells amazing! This is my 3rd time purchasing a large bottle. Love this cologne.</li>
    <li> Bought this after smelling it in a maxim a few years ago... it&#x27;s AMAZING the only cologne I wear anymore. I&#x27;ve had my 5 ounce bottle for nearly a year... one spray in front of you then walk through it an it lasts all day.. I can even smell it on my clothes when washing them and I get constant comments about how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this</li>
