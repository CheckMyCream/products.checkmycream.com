      <li>I can feel better about my body.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this cream</li>
      <li>*love</li>
      <li>While it is called a cream, it seems to have a more  liquid texture than cream to me.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product...</li>
      <li>but I love the glow it gives my skin.</li>
      <li>but I love the way it makes my skin feel and you can feel the tingling from the product working as soon as you apply it.</li>
      <li>but the more you sweat, the more inches you lose.  </li>
      <li>i will be buying more and more</li>
      <li>I will probably buy more once I run out...</li>
      <li>After the first use I swear I noticed that the inside of my thighs already looked more toned!</li>
      <li>so I could see if there was a difference between the treated and untreated areas.)The product consistency is somewhere between a lotion and a cream and goes on the skin easily.</li>
      <li>, it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>I want to thank you for making such a great item.</li>
      <li>I use this In those places and I can start to see the cellulite starting to disappear which is a great thing.</li>
      <li>Although I received this product free of charge for my honest review, I can assure you the results were real.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this when I was offered to do a review on it.</li>
      <li>When I used this it made my skin feel a bit firmer, and the company states within 30 days, you will notice a significant difference.</li>
      <li>I have not found a product that successfully treats the areas I mentioned, so this product is not much different from others I have tried.</li>
      <li>Great product, I haven&#x27;t used  it for long</li>
      <li>Okay this Cellulite Cream worked really well</li>
      <li>Other products are great.</li>
      <li>Its smell, which I find just a bit offputting to me but maybe not be to everyone else, does dissipate fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>It has only been about a week, and I do see improvement in my legs, and will do a follow up post in three more weeks to let you know how much more of a difference this has made.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a lovely cream, and a lovely company but dry brushing, exfoliating, AND also applying this cream three times a day is way out of my comfort zone!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely betting on some awesome looking legs in the near future!</li>
      <li>the only thing I like about this cream, was that it made my skin soft and did nothing for the cellulite, So the cellulite I will carry, but it was a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>After you first apply it, it may tingle just a bit.</li>
      <li>but if u pair this with the waist trimmer ull sweat so much!</li>
      <li>i dont know if u are aware</li>
      <li>When I first out it on, i noticed that it smells like coffee and peppermint.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the company sent the following tips, all of which would be helpful for cellulite even without the cream: &amp;#34;The appearance of cellulites and fat cells is mostly attributed to genetics...</li>
      <li>but I love the tingly feeling I did add some lavender essential oil to offset the smell</li>
      <li>It has a nice cooling effect unlike some other lotions that almost burn!</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that after 2 and a half weeks I see no results whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dry brushing your skin before shower will also help remove dead skin cells and promote blood circulation, therefore allowing your skin to absorb the cellulite cream more effectively.  </li>
      <li>This is a very energized cream infused with rose hip and green tea to fight the signs of cellulite and improve the tightness of your skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this cream</li>
      <li>Thanks for the discounted product</li>
      <li>I believe this cream is better than any other cellulite cream I have used.</li>
      <li>I find that this cellulite cream in particular works fast and has visible results.  </li>
      <li>i do exfoliate prior to using and then use a derma roller to make certain it is totally absorbed in my skin.</li>
      <li>(I think of a cream as having more substance, thickness, or slight bulk.  </li>
      <li>Decent size tub, but boy.</li>
      <li>I do not have cellulite (good genetics, I guess) but have noticed loss of skin elasticity over the last few years since I turned 40</li>
      <li>This removes dead skin cells, allowing the skin to drink up the cream better.  </li>
      <li>It does not leave any stickiness or uncomfortable feeling, rather a very nice relaxing feeling.</li>
      <li>This stuff really helps firm and smooth as well.  </li>
      <li>Coupled with a healthy diet and regular and proper exercise, beat the genetics excuse to having cellulites.  </li>
      <li>natural or synthetic-- I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
      <li>I have received the cream and so far I am liking it.</li>
      <li>The last part may not sound important but it really seems to make a difference.  </li>
      <li>I will keep it to use a few days before a special occasion.</li>
      <li>:( The company is great thou.</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>

    <li> Gave as gift to my wife. Loves it!</li>
    <li> Wife says she can tell a difference already.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible and no noticeable improvement to appearance of cellulite.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a few days now. I can see a difference in the appearance in my skin texture and smoothness already. After you first apply it, it may tingle just a bit. But will not last for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I got a great discount to try this. I like that it has caffeine because that helps shrink the fat temporarily. I don&#x27;t think this holds up long term, but if you keep using it, I think you would notice a reduction in your cellulite. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t be where I can put it on three times a day. I will keep it to use a few days before a special occasion.</li>
    <li> Although I have not used this product long enough to make a final determination, it definitely seems that it has potential.  What do I notice? While it is called a cream, it seems to have a more  liquid texture than cream to me. (I think of a cream as having more substance, thickness, or slight bulk.  This does not.)  It has a lot of good ingredients that might really prove be quite effective!  Its smell, which I find just a bit offputting to me but maybe not be to everyone else, does dissipate fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This is one wonderfully great product and I am in love. This is a owner healer for me I have cellulite in some places that I am embarrased about. I use this In those places and I can start to see the cellulite starting to disappear which is a great thing. I hope in not to long of a time it will totally disappear nd I can feel better about my body. I want to thank you for making such a great item.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I *love* this stuff!!!  I use it by slathering my stomach with two thick layers, wrapping my torso with plastic wrap, and putting on my wist cyncher.  Then, I exercise for 15 minutes going hard and after that I wear it around the house for the next 30 minutes.  The last part may not sound important but it really seems to make a difference.  I find that this cellulite cream in particular works fast and has visible results.  Now wearing the plastic wrap and corset may feel like you&#x27;re sliding around a lot in there but the more you sweat, the more inches you lose.  This stuff really helps firm and smooth as well.  Although I received this product free of charge for my honest review, I can assure you the results were real.  I will probably buy more once I run out... if I still need it then.</li>
    <li> Great product, I haven&#x27;t used  it for long but I love the tingly feeling I did add some lavender essential oil to offset the smell but I love the glow it gives my skin. i do exfoliate prior to using and then use a derma roller to make certain it is totally absorbed in my skin. Thanks for the discounted product my review is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> When I first out it on, i noticed that it smells like coffee and peppermint. It has a nice cooling effect unlike some other lotions that almost burn! After the first use I swear I noticed that the inside of my thighs already looked more toned! It&#x27;s kinda runny but a little goes a long way so maybe a quarter size amount for each thigh. It&#x27;s also a dark cream/beige color, not white life the other creams that I have bought. I&#x27;m definitely betting on some awesome looking legs in the near future! :) I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this when I was offered to do a review on it. Decent size tub, but boy. That smell! Oof. I would definitely try and change that. I recently lost a bunch of weight and I&#x27;m hoping this helps!</li>
    <li> I have received the cream and so far I am liking it. I received it today in the morning and decided to try it out I followed the directions and then placed it on the back and front of my thighs. It feels moisturizing and you can actually feel the cream sinking in to your skin. I believe this cream is better than any other cellulite cream I have used.</li>
    <li> My skin looks firmer and smoother.  I really like this cream, it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I have been using it everyday and have noticed a difference in just a few days.  I would definitely recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product... soooo i dont use it for its intended use... ill explain lol.. so i wear a waist trimmer 24 hours a way... i dont know if u are aware but if u pair this with the waist trimmer ull sweat so much! it basically paired with the waist trimmer gives the extra heat and ull definitely lose inches from your belly... great product will keep buying</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply! And doesn&#x27;t have bad smell</li>
    <li> This is a very energized cream infused with rose hip and green tea to fight the signs of cellulite and improve the tightness of your skin. When I used this it made my skin feel a bit firmer, and the company states within 30 days, you will notice a significant difference. It has only been about a week, and I do see improvement in my legs, and will do a follow up post in three more weeks to let you know how much more of a difference this has made. From what I can tell at this point, it is a very good and working product. It does not leave any stickiness or uncomfortable feeling, rather a very nice relaxing feeling. I did receive this product at discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream with the derma-roller and I have seen tightening of the skin. I do not have cellulite (good genetics, I guess) but have noticed loss of skin elasticity over the last few years since I turned 40 This has definitely helped.</li>
    <li> I use this cream once a day and it work great for me i will be buying more and more</li>
    <li> the only thing I like about this cream, was that it made my skin soft and did nothing for the cellulite, So the cellulite I will carry, but it was a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Have been using for several weeks and can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference. In fairness to the product, however, I have been using it on 2 difficult to treat areas--upper arm and thigh just above the knee.(I only treated one arm and one thigh so I could see if there was a difference between the treated and untreated areas.)The product consistency is somewhere between a lotion and a cream and goes on the skin easily. The scent is a mixture of orange and peppermint and lingers for at least 15 minutes. (Perhaps if less is used, the smell might disappear faster? )  I have not found a product that successfully treats the areas I mentioned, so this product is not much different from others I have tried. Because I prefer products that have no scent---natural or synthetic-- I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I can feel this product working when I apply it. I have only been using it for a week but I love the way it makes my skin feel and you can feel the tingling from the product working as soon as you apply it. I am looking forward to seeing the results after more use.</li>
    <li> I wanted this cream to work and it&#x27;s a lovely cream, and a lovely company but dry brushing, exfoliating, AND also applying this cream three times a day is way out of my comfort zone!  Nevertheless, I gave it a try (even though I&#x27;ve read that there are no creams that help).  I took before and after pictures and would have waited until the jar was empty to write the review but the company has asked me twice to write something.  I can honestly say that after 2 and a half weeks I see no results whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the company sent the following tips, all of which would be helpful for cellulite even without the cream: &amp;#34;The appearance of cellulites and fat cells is mostly attributed to genetics... Coupled with a healthy diet and regular and proper exercise, beat the genetics excuse to having cellulites.  Exfoliate your skin, preferably every other day, before applying the cream.  This removes dead skin cells, allowing the skin to drink up the cream better.  Dry brushing your skin before shower will also help remove dead skin cells and promote blood circulation, therefore allowing your skin to absorb the cellulite cream more effectively.  At the same time, the improved blood circulation allows the burning of fats and cellulites...We cannot overemphasize enough the importance of hydration.  Drink plenty of water to flush out fats, cellulites and toxins out of your body.  Water also helps keep your skin moisturized and helps distributes nutrients in your body.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it and if it turns out that it does something, I&#x27;ll update this!</li>
    <li> Okay this Cellulite Cream worked really well and I did notice an improvement on my legs.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this cream but unfortunately it did nothing for my skin....:( The company is great thou. Other products are great.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used enough to say anything bad</li>
