<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m pretty used to dying my hair.  I&#x27;ve been doing so since about 2007.  I use hair dyes mostly to cover up any grey hair that seem to peek through.  I had the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair sent to me and was able to experiment with it.  It&#x27;s not the usual squirt bottle method a lot of dyes currently use.  This particular brand uses the brush method, which I will admit I was a little nervous as I&#x27;ve never utilized this method before.  It was very simple and actually a lot more easier than the brush method.  I felt like I was able to spread it more evenly throughout my hair.  Another plus about this brand was that you didn&#x27;t have to worry about that awful hair dye stench.  YUCK!  Once the product was washed out you were also able to use your own shampoo to wash with which is a super plus!!!  I will definitely use this product again :)</li>
    <li> I received this from Vidal Sassoon via the BzzAgent program to try out for free, It contained all the things you need to get Salon results at home, and dye your hair with confidence. I was surprised to see all that fit in that small box, from the mixing bowl, brush, cream tube, bottle with the activation lotions, a sachet of the VS serum, the conditioning tube, gloves the brush and instruction. The cream color was silky and rich, it went on nicely, my grey area is in the front hair line, usually I have a problem there, but this covered it all in one application. It is a two step process but I found it easy to follow. I love how my hair came out and feels over all</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. So easy to use and loved how it covered all my grays. It also gave me an awesome color for weeks. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free color kit from Vidal Sassoon and I have to say I absolutely love it! Not only was the coverage great but my hair feels so soft after using it instead of dry and brittle.I am a huge fan and will definitely buy this product.They are true to their advertising ,it is salon quality color.I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color Medium Gold in my BZzKit. the kit is high quality and not your average at home hair color. The process took a little longer but the coverage was wonderful. Product was easy to rinse out, no strong odor. And the color is beautiful, shiny and so natural looking. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair. I will definitely continue using Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color.</li>
    <li> I am SOOOOOO happy I was choosen to participate in trying this amazing product. I love the shine and how the texture of my hair feels.  Touche&#x27; Vidal Sassoon!! Please I need some more coupons (smile)..... I continuously receive compliments.  People ask what did I do to my hair?  I told them I did not do it.. It&#x27;s Vidal Sassoon did it ......... Thank you Buzz Agent ...</li>
    <li> Received a free box from Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour from Vidal Sassoon, through my Bzz Agent account. So happy, happy, happy with the results. Color is deep and rich, covered all of my grays, and didn&#x27;t make everyone gag from the smell that other brands have. I look fantastic. I am going to go out on a limb next time I color and use the red. I just think it would look good with my skin tones. The tray and brush that were included make it very easy to apply.  Hair is so shiny and it looks like I went to a salon.</li>
    <li> I really do like the new Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color that I can do myself, in the privacy of my own home! While this 2 step process was tricky at first I think that it was well worth the effort that it took.  My color came out great and I saved a ton of money!  I would definitely use this again!&lt;br /&gt;I have received a FREE full sized sample from Vidal Sassoon so that I may try this product at home.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received vidal sassoon salonist hair color through bzzagent to try for free. It had a nice shade/tint to it, was fairly easy to execute and I generally liked the results overall. I love this brand of products. #sponsored #freesample</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. Very easy to use and excellent results. The color was a perfect match. Thanks viddal sassoon for saving us time and a lot money</li>
    <li> Best hair color I have ever used.  It was time consuming with the two step process and I did get a shade darker than I usually wear.  That being said....It went on great, the smell (or lack there of) was wonderful and the conditioner keeps my hair soft.  It has been 3 weeks since I colored &amp; normally by now, I am in desperate need of recoloring my hair, not so with Vidal Sassoon Colorist!  It doesn&#x27;t fade, it covered the gray beautifully! I am completely hooked on my new at home color kit!  I hope they continue to make it and have it for sale in stores!  Receives an A+ from me!  Thank you Vidal Sassoon for allowing me to try &amp; use this color kit!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I haven&#x27;t tried and Vidal Sassoon products in ages.  I&#x27;ve have had such great luck with items I&#x27;ve heard about on Bzzagent.com that I decided to give it a go.  The fragrance was nice, not to overpowering.  The color turned out great AND it hasn&#x27;t washed away like so many others do after a couple of days.  The only negative if you can call it that would be the application process.  I would like to see them also include a bottle with tip applicator.  Overall I would definitely but this product again and have already.  Good job Vidal Sassoon for bringing back a customer and thanks Bzzagent for letting me review this product.</li>
    <li> Vidal sasson salonist hair color was amazing I loved it I recived my free box and did my daughters hair and results were amazing</li>
    <li> I thought this worked very well and not that hard do do.  As a Bzz Agent I received a free box from Vidal Sassoon to try.  Having dyed my hair before I wondered if this was going to be as messy as some of the other hair dyes were.  I was happy to see that it was not the mess, lets face there is going to be some mess.  But it was a small amount of messiness not that much to worry about.  I liked the 2 step process of getting the roots done first and then blending in the the rest of my hair.  I found it easy to use and the results were great.  I received lots of compliments on my hair color from family, friends and co-workers.</li>
    <li> I had tried the black..very good coverage!I was a little scared by the 2 step process but it was a lot easier than I thought it would be.The color is bold and rich which is what I wanted.My hair wasn&#x27;t at all too dried out after coloring,I used the after dye conditioner and it made my hair nice and soft.I was very pleased over all and will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great true colour, great grey coverage and my hair feels healthy. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I was sent a free box to review of the #vidal Sassoon Salonist hair color.  I was Soo excited to try it.  I loved that it came with the mixing bowl and brush.  I thought that was a good idea, but the brush really wasn&#x27;t too helpful.  Unfortunately it only covered about 60% of my grey.  It didn&#x27;t color my hair very well.</li>
    <li> I got to try this hair color from BzzAgent!! Not only was it easier to use than I expected but the results were completely the same as when I go to the salon. No joke.  Upon opening the box I was excited to see it had a brush and tray, which will make application much easier. The gloves, brush, and bowl were very high quality and felt very similar to what my hairdresser uses.  This dye is great, easy to apply, and looks and feels great. I really like how this dye uses a tray and brush like a salon verses a bottle like most boxed dyes.  Your hair feels soft and manageable after coloring and looks great. There are many different color choices to choose from. I really believe that I will be able to save hundreds of dollars a year by doing it myself. I would definitely buy this product again, just for ease of application and color results.</li>
    <li> I received my #vidalsasson #salonist 2 step color process free as a #Buzz agent and I was a little skeptical upon opening the box.  I was nervous about the process of using a brush and then remixing and reapplying 20 minutes later. I have been an at home colorer for many years now and have always had to use 2 boxes of product to cover all of my hair. Needless to say I was very pleased with the results. The process did not take any longer than products I have used in the past and I actuall think the brush made it easier.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, very thick hair and 1 box covered everything nice and evenly. My grays disappeared and my natural highlights shown thru. And My grays were covered nicely and my husband loved the color. Win Win for everyone</li>
    <li> I got this kit for FREE from Vidal Sassoon to try as a marketing promotion. I used it to color my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair. We both loved the super professional and high quality tools, as well as the easy instructions. What this works best on: ROOTS! Wow, her roots looked so great (meaning they were GONE!) the color was nicely uniform. It was easy to use and fun to do. She looks great!&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you stay within a couple of shades of your previous color.</li>
    <li> I received this hair color kit from Vidal Sassoon for free to try out and review.  Without hesitation I can say that I loved it.  I have been coloring my hair at home for years and I found this kit easy to use. I loved access to professional salon tools and the instructions were easy to follow.  I felt comfortable throughout the process that I would be able to get great results.  I used the Medium Golden Brown color.  It was a perfect hue and came out looking great.  I am going to use this product again and I recommend to others.</li>
    <li> ive been coloring my hair since my pre teen days and the products out there ive watched grow and change. Vidal is so legendary in the business and i was excited that even after his death his brand continued to grow now to even at home coloring. I never hesistated to purchase because of the brand image. The system was so  easy to use without too much of a chemical or perfumed smell. color was vibrant and lasted quite long !</li>
    <li> I really liked the end result for this color. However, it was a lengthy process since you are essentially coloring your hair twice. You start with your roots, then you set everything down and step away for 20 minutes, and come back and use the rest of the color in the rest of your hair. It&#x27;s really good for matching your roots with your hair, but if they would just include a second set of gloves, I would be much happier. I got this product for free to try from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> I was fortunately enough to get to try this NEW product directly from Vidal Sassoon for free so I could review it and let everyone know what I think of the product!    Pro: it works, it colored my hair; it doesn&#x27;t smell bad; ultimately it does what it is supposed to.  You get what you pay for, the price is at the high end of the home coloring system.    Con: it is not a quick coloring system or color brightening up system, it is like what you will get at a salon, except we are not trained hair stylist and it does get messy, maybe a robe will be handy!  for a busy working mom, it might be a luxury that I don&#x27;t have time to enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when I opened the box and there was a tray, several tubes and bottles and a brush but the directions were clear and easy to use! The color came out nice. I have received several compliments on it. You can&#x27;t tell I did it at home in less then an hour from start to end of wash! Thank you Vidal Sassoon for allowing me to try this product free, I will be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> What a great Idea!  Roots then tips!  Color where you need it most then add it to the rest so you don&#x27;t look two toned.  So soft and luxurious feeling.  Was a little intimidated by all the steps but it was really very easy! Too bad it didn&#x27;t cover as well as it says it well.  On the good side, there is little to no odor and the conditioner smells awesome and leaves your hair shiny and soft.  Too bad it would have been a great product otherwise</li>
    <li> Well, I used some \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; color in the past. It was my go to stuff. SO, I decided to step out and try something new and different.    Salonist, at first, was a little intimidating. It seemed like lots of steps like being in the salon. Boy was I wrong!!!! Simple, clear directions from A to Z (my spouse volunteered to help me), and I was done. Let me tell you, the results were notthing like I had expected. The depth of the color was totally different from any other color I had used in the past. My hair was looking so vibrant. Even stepping out in the sun at work, the depth and tones of the color popped!!!! I have now taken as least 15 years off my looks, and definitely in a good way. And the best thing about this product? I got to try it totally free through a website called Bzzagent!  :-)</li>
    <li> I got this from BzzAgent for FREE to try and write my review. Opinions are 100% mine.  I am impressed. I opened the box and it had everything I needed to do it. Gloves, mixing bowl, brush, and coloring mix stuff. Upon mixing it was pretty harsh, although it did not last very long. Only thing I can complain about is that I could not have done this by myself. Not with the 2 step process it would have been way too hard. I have a lot of hair so help is a must. I did the process and when it was time to wash out, was easy and quick not like other where I was rinsing for what seemed like forever. Then after washing and using the conditioner supplied, my hair felt so good. And y daughter says it smells really good. I was considering cutting some of my hair before because it looked dead at dull. This conditioned my air so good that I don&#x27;t want to do that anymore. Not that I had grays to begin with but it made my hair look and feel younger than before I colored it. I would gladly use it again next time I color.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product for review from Vidal Sassoon,my opinions are my own...This was my first time trying Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair color and I love it,The application is overall easy and the color is great,leaves your hair soft and shiny.I have colored my hair from home for many years and have tried many different brands and this is the first brand that actually had a pleasant scent,The conditioning with this hair color is also great leaves your hair so smooth and silky...Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I received a Salonist kit free from Bzzagent.  I really liked it.  It is as easy to use as other hair coloring kits I have used in the past.  The process does remind me more of a professional coloring.  It also blends the color much better than the other kits.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the color that I received.  I got a light gold brown and I normally color my hair a light auburn red.  When I am ready for another coloring kit, I will purchase this brand in a light red color.  If it works as well as this one, I am sure that I will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> I received Salonist for free to try and am offering my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very low maintenance with my hair. I usually don&#x27;t style it aside from putting it in a ponytail or bun and I rarely color it. I generally pick hair color based on how quickly I can be done with it. Basically, Salonist is the exact opposite of what I would normally choose.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found the two step process to be tedious and hard. I&#x27;m not a hairstylist, I don&#x27;t know how to divide and &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the color into my hair. I tried but it was not fun or easy. There was definitely a point as I was awkwardly trying to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the back of my head when I seriously considered giving up and just smooshing the color around my whole head like I normally would. As annoyed as I was with the whole process I have to say that the color came out really nicely. My grays are completely covered and the color has depth and shine. I color my hair dark brown and a lot of dyes end up looking black and very flat. This color is a very natural looking dark brown. I liked the end result and I actually will probably end up using Salonist again. I just hope I won&#x27;t have to for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color! So easy and looks professionally done with multiple tones and depth! It&#x27;s an easy 2 step process, which may be a little more work than you&#x27;re used to but totally worth it. I tried the Black and it colored my grey no problem. I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> OOMPH TIME! My roots had grown out an inch and my hair needed to be revitalized. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair various colors and used multiple different brands, but the two-step, roots-to-length Vidal Sassoon salonist experience was very intriguing and unique. I thought it was going to be a daunting experience, but I put on my gloves, followed the easy-to-read salonist instructions, and BAM! I was well on my way to receiving an at-home salon experience for free from Vidal Sassoon. I thought the two-step process was very unique. I really liked the idea of the serum. It added such depth of tones to my hair color and gave me that extra oomph I needed. It felt like I was getting the special treatment from the salon and the hairstylist let me in on a little secret. I really appreciate that VS salonist is available in various different colors and shades. I would have given this product five stars had the color I chose been a little darker. I suppose this gives me all the more reason to go out and try another box!</li>
    <li> Vidal Salonist Hair Colour Permanent - is a two Step Salon level home permanent colour system that is new from Vidal Sassoon. I was lucky to be able to try this free from the brand, but will use it again in the future and highly reccommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step is a root treat meant that you leave on for approximately 20 minutes, then you mix in a gloss treatment to the remaining mixture and add to the body of your hair and treat for another 10 minutes; so even though you have a 2-step- it is still only a half-hour home kit and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss makes your hair not only look great, but also conditions. Vidal Sassoon ask includes in the box, a conditioner to use with your regular shampoo to maintain your colour over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Medium Blonde 8N and was very impressed with the colour result and quality of tones throughout my hair.</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sasson Salonist Hair Color complimentary for testing purposes and my honest opinion about the product. Vidal Sasson Salonist Hair Colour [3/0 Darkest Neutral Brown] was a at the salon feeling only I was at home. I was impressed with everything that was included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Inside there is a mixing bowl, application brush, black gloves which fit so much better than those plastic ones that are normally pressed into the instruction pamphlet. Also were the colour cream to combine with the colour activating lotion. And the Serum (conditioner) that is more than in included in those other hair color products.&lt;br /&gt;I really was impressed with how easy this product was to work with. From the instructions to the actual product itself, it was very easy. There was no strong odor of chemicals. The instructions teach you in a brief way how to get that professional hair care feeling at home. There is a bit of a difference when you save some of the colour treatment and after the set time you add the remainder to your hair. After following the rest of the instructions, my hair was a beautiful dark brown. I would recommend Vidal Sasson Hair Salonist to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> love the way my hair came out. i never thought of dying my gray hair blond and leaving the bottom of my hair brown. but i tried it and i loved it</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent from the brand to sample and give my feedback. I was super excited to give it a try as I had not colored my hair for some time and it was beginning to look drab. I chose the light golden brown since I have dark brown hair and wanted a little bit of a lighter shade- nothing too drastic or noticeable just a simple update and some added shine. The directions included seemed very simple and easy however I recommend you have someone help you especially with the roots. I was not able to hold a mirror and separate hair in the back part and color- I only have 2 hands so I found that very difficult to tell if I was getting all the hair and evenly. The next step being about 15 minutes later was to put the color over the rest of the hair ie everything but the roots- by this time the hair was stiff and straw like and made it very difficult to move color easily through the hair near the roots. I will say I really liked the scent and texture of the conditioner that was included. Made my hair manageable and soft. The reason I have to give a 3 is because the color did not come out even close to what I expected which was as the name says &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; but instead came out red. I was going for a subtle update and this one was way too noticeable and not only in sunlight but in general the hair has a very red overtone to it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had a color I didn&#x27;t like and thanks to a sample box from Vidal Sassoon I was able to fix my blonde streaks and then get dark ones put in at my salon to complete the look! My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry or stringy after dying it was great!</li>
    <li> When I received my FREE  Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permenant Hair Color from BzzAgent I hoped that this at home color would be the solution to my hair plights. At the time I had Vidal Sassoon Pro Series London Luxe Deep Velvet Violet  in my hair,  I was ready for a change especially since that color had not turned out to be the vibrant change I desired.  I received the shade 5/0 Medium Neutral Brown. ( BOX says 100% Grey Coverage)    I consider myself to be an expert at DIY hair, so this 2 step procedure did not deem itself too challenging for me.  The kit contained 2 mixers for step 1 and 1 serum for step 2, a mixing bowl with lid, 1 brush and 1 pair of black latex gloves, 1 conditioner , NO SHAMPOO. the instructions indicate that you should use a color safe shampoo to wash out the the hair before applying the conditioner in the kit.    There is a 25 minute wait time between steps 1 and 2.    Okay, so there are some things that I really like about the kit and some that I think if improved could make this a better kit overall.    I honestly don&#x27;t mind the longer process if I&#x27;m going to get the results I want but this dye didn&#x27;t deliver those results for me.    I&#x27;m sorry if my review seems like it&#x27;s a bit scattered, but let me say this- If you decide on trying this particular line from VS , I absolutely recommend heading to their website and checking out the tutorial videos . Instructions vary depending on the shade you plan on using and I think if I had done that prior to picking the shade it would have greatly improved my experience.  In all fairness I have to mention that I do have 2 extremely STUBBORN patches of grey  hair whose sole purpose is to increase my blood pressure. I absolutely judge at home color kits based on their ability  to make those suckers go away for as long as possible.   They were still taunting me, gleaming their shinny grey grin when I rinsed out the final conditioner , my heart sunk, because I had anticipated that they would at least be gonefor 3 weeks ( miracles would be necessary for a 4th week).    I have never used 2 boxes of any kit for my hair even though it long, from the moment I mixed up the 1st step packets, I got slightly anxious that there might not be enough.  Turns out it was enough and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed more.    The brush is a good brush that&#x27;st stiff enough to apply the color and smooth it in without splattering , so that&#x27;s a plus. using a brush however does add time to the process as opposed to nozzle type bottle because you have to stop and dip into the bowl.    The salon type bowl has a line marking in the bottom because you have to use a specific amount of step 1 and save the rest for step 2. Brilliant to have the line marking. Making the bowl black - hmmm, impossible to see the line when there&#x27;s products sitting on top of it. VS - might I suggest a clear / transparent bowl with markings along the bottom and sides, that way one can just lift the bowl and see right where the separation should be.    1 pair of black gloves that have to be reused in step 2.  Love the black - but remember that episode of Friends when Ross had on the leather pants and went to the bathroom and we spent 20 mins giggling about his antics to get them back on? very similar situation. Except this time I&#x27;m left with messy dye stained fingers and counter top- Please MR. VS, throw in a second pair, pretty please.    Use a color safe shampoo- I think any kit should come with all the components needed to perfect the process- too much margin for error. how many people out there don&#x27;t even know if the shampoo is color safe or don&#x27;t have one on hand, then they have to spend extra money if they don&#x27;t.  I used the VS Pro Series Shampoo  because I had it on hand, I also had other one brands in my bathroom and I couldn&#x27;t help but think how uncomfortable I would be using another brand with my kit if I didn&#x27;t have VS , this is my hair - such a great aspect of my beauty regime and confidence - I how out of sorts Ifeel when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day, the last thing I need is something to worry about .    So let me sum it all up before you fall asleep, overall I would not use this particular line from VS. Mainly because I ended up having blotchy patches and spotty coverage and totally uncovered greys . As I said, I deem myself an expert with the DIY home kits so I really don&#x27;t understand how the heck that happened. Greatly disappointed really, but I can still give you some good pointers.    1. Watch the website tutorial or use the recommend App Blippar  I think these will greatly enhance your experience with this line in terms of how to choose a color ( they apparently have shade that specifically won&#x27;t cover gray) instructions and all you really need to know about the Salonist Line.    * I must say , besides the whole color issue , my hair felt soft and didn&#x27;t feel damaged , so that&#x27;s also a plus.</li>
    <li> Im not a fan of this product. At home hair colour is supposed to be easy to apply. Maybe because I am used to the foam colours I didn&#x27;t like this one.. but I felt it to be to many steps for an at home easy colour application. The colour was fantastic... maybe id buy it if it was a foam colour.</li>
    <li> Personally, I&#x27;m a bottle girl, but when I do other people&#x27;s hair, I use a brush and bowl. It was a little hard to brush on the color without some assistance, but I think I did alright. The brush was a little small (I use the wider brushes), but it took a little longer that I normally take when I use a bottle. But that aside, I loved the results! My hair is softer and shinier, plus it covered my grays beautifully! I definitely recommend this system, but only if you have someone to help you and they know what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> I love being a Bzzagent. I get to try new products and sometimes get a new experience. I was chosen to try #VidalSassoon Salonist for free. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair at home for 20 years. This felt a little more fancy then any other type I have tried before. The packaging is appealing but I don&#x27;t feel the color on the model quite goes with the color results. The gloves that came with the kit are amazing! Most other brands and kits have the cheap thin plastic gloves the rip before you have even fully gotten them on your hands! So they never fully protect your hands from dying. These gloves were thick and didn&#x27;t tear at all. No dye left on my hands! I should note now that there will be a part where you will need the gloves again. I am glad I fully read through the directions first so I knew to wash the gloves off and carefully take them off when needed. When I took the rest of the supplies out of the box I then noticed how different this would be. First I noticed a brush. I&#x27;ve never used a brush to dye my hair before. I&#x27;ve always applied straight from the bottle. Then I noticed the bowl. I&#x27;ve always mixed in the bottle, never in a bowl. I then pulled out and read the directions (which is when I learned about the gloves). Ok. I felt ready to do this. I&#x27;m tired of seeing grey hair on my head! Also I had some pretty serious color grow out and things were looking really uneven. I set out my supplies, pulled on the gloves and started adding the ingredients into the bowl. It was a little hard to mix together at first. One part was really thick like an ointment and the other was very runny like water. Once they started mixing a little it became easier until I had a nice evenly blended mixture. Your supposed to separate and only use a certain portion for your roots and a portion for the tips. Its a little hard to know for sure if I&#x27;m using the right amounts in each step. I also have slightly longer then medium hair and I felt I wouldn&#x27;t have enough. Time to apply. The directions call for the roots to be done first. This made me slightly nervous at first. The brush felt a little odd at first. It is my first time, but after a few attempts I felt at ease and had all my roots covered. I waited the time stated and then used the remaining amount of mixture and applied it to my tips. I just barely had enough to cover all my hair. After waiting the next required time I went and rinsed my hair out. I really felt my hair was very brittle and straw like after rinsing. I used the conditioning part and my hair felt a little softer but I wasn&#x27;t happy. I decided to do a round with my favorite conditioner for color treated hair. After my hair had dried I took a look... I was please with the results. I didn&#x27;t notice any grey and my color looked more even. It didn&#x27;t match the color on the box, but my hair rarely does. The husband says it took a few years off. That of course means everything! Overall I would say I&#x27;m happy with this product and would probably use it again. I would like for better conditioning though.</li>
    <li> I received the new Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color free from Vidal Sassoon so that I would try it and let everyone know about the product.  It is a two step coloring process.  It does take about twice as long as it normally would take to color your hair at home.  The process seemed a little daunting but I jumped right in.  Surprising, it went very well.  The instructions were complete and easy to understand.  Nothing about it was confusing.  After finishing, I was thrilled with my results.  The two step coloring blended seamlessly!  It covered my gray hairs and the overall color was beautiful.  I am very happy with this new product and I will definitely purchase this the next time my hair needs coloring.</li>
    <li> I have very long fine hair. Love the shade, but sadly it did not completely cover my grey hair. IT gave the rest of my hair an amazing beautiful color. The formula was easy to use and apply. There was no burning or irritation to my scalp. It was interesting to apply to the roots and then the rest of the hair. Great idea since the bottom part of our hair doesn&#x27;t really need much color. I received this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> really love this product, It is the only one I use now</li>
    <li> Fantastic coverage and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  The results I got were better than I expected. I would definitely use this product again.  I got to try this product FREE through Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzzagent and got this product as a trial to try and review it, I want to say that I really think its the best out there, I always have problems trying to dye my hair myself but with this it wasn&#x27;t that bad, you just got to make sure that you dont wash your hair before using this product because you really need the oils, second make sure you part your hair in sections for the roots because it will get the color distributed all through, make sure to apply to your roots and then afterwards apply to the ends, wait the time limit and make sure to wash it out really well, so far its been a couple of weeks and the hair color is just as good as it was the same day. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I always liked Vidal Sassoon products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint. It was very easy to use and apply to my hair. I purchased it in dark neutral brown and the color came out just like the color on the box. I would definitely use it again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from bzzagent.com, but this is my honest opinion.  I loved it. This was the first time I ever dyed my own hair. The instructions were so easy to follow. It covered all my grays, and one box covered my very thick long hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for being a bzzagent. At first I didnt know if I would like the color that was sent. But after applying it, I love it. Got a lot of complements at work.</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour it free from BzzAgent. It is undoubtedly the best hair color I have used so far. It take a little more effort  to do yourself because you have to section your hair so you can apply it to the roots but it is not hard to do at all. I must say, it is worth the extra effort. The results are better than any hair color I have used. I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair but have it here and there throughout my hair. I have had a problem, in the past,  covering my gray but this hair color covered all my gray as far as I can tell.  It is very rich color and gave my hair the appearance or highlights. It is  very natural looking hair color. It not seem to be harsh at all like some hair color I have used in the past. It did not burn me and the smell was pleasant enough. My hair felt and looked great when it was done. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This product was received as a promotion through BZZ Agent. I have to say I am quite pleased with the results!! It was so easy to use and the color has lasted now for 4 weeks!!</li>
    <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color Kit in the shade 6/0 Light Neutral Brown for free as a Bzz Agent to try and review.  I was initially intrigued by this product since it promised a more salon type coloring experience than a traditional drugstore hair dye product.  Upon opening the box I found that it included a brush and tray and was applied in a two step process beginning with applying it to the roots of the hair first.  The process promises to cover stubborn grays at the roots and it didn&#x27;t fail to disappoint.  The result was a natural look with the grays seemingly neutralized.  Time will tell how long the roots will stay covered.  The second part of the process involves mixing a serum into the mixture to make it more of a glaze to apply to the remainder of the hair.  The idea is to make it blend with the roots better.  I liked the effect except felt that the color overall was a bit darker than expected.  I definitely would recommend this product as an alternative to an expensive salon coloring session.</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Kit to try for free from BzzAgent and I am so glad I did! I have been coloring my hair for about 10 years now and have tried about every product there is on the market.  Covering my gray has been a high priority for me when coloring my hair and it has been difficult to find a product that has a rich deep color and will still cover my gray.  After using the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Kit, I was amazed with how the 2 step process not only covered my gray but my hair looks and feels so soft and actually has some body. WOW!! The 2-step process was easy to understand and the result was worth it! This product is well worth the cost and everyone who wants to cover their gray should go out right now and buy it!</li>
    <li> received the product from Vidal Sassoon. I have some grey hair and have been coloring my hair for awhile.I loved this product. Was easy to use and made my hair richer in color than any other brand I have used. covered up my roots better then any other brand i used before and more richer in color on my roots then other brands. I Will buy this product when I need to dye my hair again.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon gave me this product to try and I am not very experienced at coloring hair so I had help but if you have colored your hair before you would do fine by yourself.I love my color and it flows so evenly and it&#x27;s shinny healthy looking.I would recommend it to anyone.Thanks to Bzzagent also.</li>
    <li> This is the best colour that I have ever used! The 2 step system was so easy and I highly recommend trying it out!!</li>
    <li> I just tried this product the very first time and I have to give it a 5 star . It was easy to use and it has great results. You can&#x27;t tell that I did it myself. I just love it . I will definitely will stick to this product from now on :)</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon salonist is the best permanent hair color ever !!! The tones and depths of thiscolor are awesome and the softness and texture is so great . I get compliments all the time from friends and coworkers , even strangers will say wow your hair is a beautiful color and I tell them it&#x27;s Vidal Sassoon salonist.......😁&lt;br /&gt;Thanks bzzcampaign and Vidal Sassoon</li>
    <li> I received a free box from Vidal Sassoon.  I loved everything about it.  VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR was easy to mix and to apply.  It completely covered the grays.  My hair felt and looked great after using this product, until I washed it again.  Then it went back to it&#x27;s normal, frizzy ways...</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color through BzzAgent to give my review of this product.  I really found this product easy to use and love the end result with my new color.  Everything included in the color kit was very high end from the coloring brush to the gloves.  Vidal Sassoon has done it again with another fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I got this free to try! One of the best easiest to use! And what fantastic results! A two step process  to get depth shine and color..bye bye expensive salons! My hair was soft shiny with amazing highlights ! Would recommend 100%</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding!! Professional results at a reasonable price. Great quality and results!!  I will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I loved being able to color my hair at home and get the same results that I would from a salon!  My resolution this year is to save money and this will help me keep it.  It was also easy to do by myself.</li>
    <li> I received this to try for free from Vidal Sassoon.  Overall good coverage and excellent highlights.  I have short hair so one box was plenty.  The directions were slightly confusing, I think it&#x27;s because of they way they were laid out on the page.  Had to laugh at the instruction to remove and then later put gloves back on.  There is no way I could have accomplished this with the gloves provided, they need to be dusted with powder or something.  The product went on easily with no drips.  The last step is supposed to be massaged into hair but had to comb it in as my hair basically would not move with all the product in.  I think I would have had more highlights if I had been able to work it through better.  I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to scrub my shower down after washing my hair, the product rinsed out well.  The color coverage is good, covered grey nicely.  I love the few highlights I do have.  I have noticed that whenever my colored hair  is washed it feels like straw until I the conditioner goes on.  With Salonist my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as damaged between wash and conditoner steps.  Overall impressed with VS Salonist.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this color it was so so awesome. The scent of it was amazing because usually the color formula sends me and my family running for the hills but this one is sweet and soft. also the conditioner is a god send, it leaves my hair so silky and shiny that it looks like I just stepped out of a salon. the price is a bit much for me but it is so very worth the fact that I do not have an allergic reaction to it and itch like with all the others and the face that it lasts forever and a day. I am so glad I got a chance to try this out through bzzagent.com for free.</li>
    <li> This product gives you professional results. And very affordable.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be selected to try this free compliments of Vidal Sassoon!  I have to admit I was really sceptical about it.  I used to dye my hair at home all the time, but it caused a lot of damage to my hair, so I stopped at home dye jobs and started going to the salon.  Well that was running me a pretty penny, so I am only able to go maybe once a year.  So I threw caution to the wind and gave this a shot.  I was really nervous thinking there wouldn&#x27;t be enough of mixture to cover all my hair, wow was I wrong.  My hair goes almost to my waist and I had plenty to do all my hair and a tad bit left over.  I also figured it was going to be a major pain using brush and having to part all my hair.  Nope, it wasn&#x27;t!  It was really easy to do.  It was actually easier than if you did it with just the bottle and your hands.  I was afraid my hair might end up multi colored due to it already being 3 different shades, blonde, dark brown, and a reddish brown.  It came out really good though, all my hair was the same color.  Washing it out was pretty easy too.  Now you can see I only gave it 3 stars, reason being, it caused damage to my hair.  As soon as I washed the dye out, used the conditioner that was provided and was ready to towel dry, I noticed how bad my hair was breaking.  I haven&#x27;t had breakage in almost a year, till I used this.  Very upset about it since it says &amp;#34;salonist hair colour permanent&amp;#34;.  What is used at the salon doesn&#x27;t cause your hair to break.  However, I loved the overall results, I truly do love my color.  It was easy to use, and the mixture was plentiful!  But I don&#x27;t think I would try it again for fear of more damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this through BzzAgent..  I&#x27;ve never been to salon to dye my hair and always used the cheap hair dye.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing and color stays bright even the days after...</li>
    <li> Hi!  I&#x27;m a Bzz agent and had never used Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s new hair color product &amp; received it in the mail to try.  I was surprised at how well it covered my gray roots!  I love the smell, softness &amp; shine of my hair now.  I would choose a more bold hair color next time with some darker red highlights.  Normally my husband doesn&#x27;t notice when I color my hair, but he actually noticed this time.  I liked the 2 step process &amp; think it helped cover the grays closer to my face.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair, but I have a mousy brown hair color I dislike.  Coloring my hair makes me feel good about myself &amp; my hubby likes it too!</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this product, after reading all of the promotional material.  I was excited to receive the product in the mail (from VS) to test. My choice was  9.5/0 Light Neutral Blonde.  It&#x27;s pretty close to the colors I usually get from other brands.  I carefully read all of the instructions twice because I saw it was a more detailed process and I wanted to get it right.  I ended up reading along as I went, too.  Mixing the 1st step was a little difficult:  the solution was very gloppy, and it was like trying to get the lumps out of batter.  I eventually turned the brush over and stirred with that--much better.  I have short hair, so I thought the root application would be a breeze.  Nope!  I found it difficult to separate my hair to try to get all the roots from every angle, especially in the back.  I used a hand mirror to see the back, but that left me just one hand to separate my hair and apply the solution.  I finally decided that was the best I could do, and waited the allotted time.  Step two involves mixing a serum in with the remaining dye.  This is easy enough.  Then you run it through all of your hair and wait, rinse, condition.  My results were good, but nothing stunning.  The color is about what I expected, but I don&#x27;t think the 2-step process made any difference.  I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with my roots being a different color.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I stay close to my natural shade?  Anyway, I was expecting more highlights, more variation in color, and more shine.  I am glad I got to try the product (thank you, VS) but this one isn&#x27;t worth the extra work.</li>
    <li> I received this free to try out and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and results of this.  The kit comes with some very nice gloves not those thin cheap ones that fall off your hands, but those think black ones.  The dye had a very pleasant smell and did not burn your eyes or scalp.  It was very easy to mix and apply.  The only thing to note was the lack of instructions if you were coloring for the first time or it had been a few months.  I used the 5/1 medium cool brown and loved the color results.  I do have very long hair so I would need two kits but I ended up just sectioning off the under section of my hair and did not apply color to that section.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again...just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this hair coloring kit except......it is very hard (for me) to make the parts in the back of the head and apply the hair coloring to the roots.  I am just not that coordinated.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I love that it colored perfectly and covered all of my grey (not too much grey yet but some).&lt;br /&gt;Also that you can wash your hair immediately after coloring so that you don&#x27;t have that horrible just colored hair smell from other hair coloring kits.&lt;br /&gt;Now after 3 weeks since coloring the color is holding up and still looks rich.&lt;br /&gt;#Gotitfree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I was able to try this free, i got it from Vidal Sassoon. I absolutely love how well it covered my grey. However, my hair is super thick and medium length, and the two step method was not easy to do by myself. I ended up having to get my hubby to help me. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, i don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be alot easier for someone with shorter hair to use.&lt;br /&gt;But as i said, it does a great job covering grey (i had alot of it too)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with shorter hair</li>
    <li> I received the new Salonist hair color complimentary from Vidal Sassoon through bzzagent. Covered the few gray hairs that I have and really did a great job on the color and highlights. It was very shiny and beautiful. I am not used to this kind of coloring kit so for me it was a little messy and I will get help the next time. I will be using again.</li>
    <li> i got mine for free by being a buzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;i liked the fact it has a big bowl for mixing, which is great , no spills. i found the gloves to be too tight for me however and wish there was 2 sets, its hard to get on and off without getting the dye all over.&lt;br /&gt;the smell was not harsh which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;all in all though i was not a fan of the 2 step process, it took much longer than i expected, i dont think i would use it again.</li>
    <li> I received this from Vidal Sassoon to try through BzzAgent to try. I dye my hair at home regularly, but have never used a kit like this one.  The product appears to be very much like salon colors.  It is mixed in a bowl, and applied with a brush.  This is a 2 step process, where you apply color to the roots first, and then mix another product in and apply it to the ends after waiting the specified amount of time.  I feel that the color was consistent and nice, but found the product to be slightly more difficult to apply on my own, however I am sure that if I use it a couple of times I will get used to it.  Overall, the product provided very nice, even color.</li>
    <li> While it took me a while to schedule a time with my husband when I could lock myself in the bathroom to dye my hair, which hasn&#x27;t seen any action since before my son was born, the day had come! I was excited to try the new two step process and see the difference it this new method.  The process was easy enough and simple to follow. It was exciting to be able to pamper myself and because the process took a bit longer than traditional hair dyes that meant extra me time! It washed out easily and the conditioner was wonderful and made my hair feel great after! There was no strong hair dye smell after the rinse lingering around either! The colour is beautiful and the two step process really added another layer of colour that has had many people asking who my new colourist is.  Overall a great, fun, new product everyone should try!</li>
    <li> Covered all my grays I had..Did not care much for the 3 step process as I did not see a big difference in doing the 2nd step.</li>
    <li> I love the rich, deep color I achieved using Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color.  I received this as a free trial from VS. I liked the professional bowl and brush system. It made the application process so easy and it left me with a look I love. I was spending a lot of $$$ to go into the salon but now I have an easy, high quality product I can use in my home, when I have time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free through the best product testing site ever: Bzzagent. This product gives you a natural looking color with high and low lights, but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t cover grays too well. The scent isn&#x27;t the horrible chemical scent that many hair dyes have, and the conditioner smells nice. I am used to the squeeze bottle applicators so the brush applicator was weird for me, but not too bad. Overall, I would say this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I got this sent free my Bzzagent and to be honest my expectations were low but i was proven wrong! the coverage is amazing! im never getting my hair professionally done again! this box does a better job, i have control of the results, and its cheaper!!! whats not to  lose!</li>
    <li> I received this through bzzagent and I thought it was okay.  Meaning it was alot of work and it didn&#x27;t seem like there was a difference in the outcome.  I did think it had a salon feel to it(the process).  The color faded a little after a couple of washes.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I recently just colored my hair with Vidal Sasson hair color. I was thrilled with the results. The process was extremely easy. My greys were completely covered. My color looked like my natural color on steroids! My hair is bouncy,soft,manageable and shiney. I could not believe the highlights. I pay good money at the salon for these results!!#Bzzagent#GotItFree#VidalSasson</li>
    <li> I recently tried the new Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Med Red Brown, and I love the results!  The kit is easy to use with a bowl, gloves, brush and product.  There is even a tube of conditioner inside too.  The product is easy to use, with easy to understand and follow directions.  The best part for me is the lack of smell, there was no strong chemical smell!  After applying the remainder dye for part 2 of the instructions, there is a slight odor, but nothing like other dyes - you know the kind of odor, chokes you!  Amonia smell....I love this product and will buy again.  Thank you Vidal Sassoon!  #VidalSassoon #Salonist #Sponsored</li>
    <li> I recieved Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour free to try and it is great. It covers the gray and looks so natural. I was so tired of getting hair color that didn&#x27;t cover or looked brassy or unreal. This transformed my hair in to healthy young looking hair that I could style!</li>
    <li> I got this from #bzzagent for free, Honestly I thought it would be a little harder to work with because it came with a brush and other stuff that im not used to using but i dont want to go to the salon to get my hair done. But surprisingly this was easy to use. I actually really love this product it gave my the same results as if I went to the salon. No other hair box dye has done that. My hair was shiny, vibrant in color and really soft. I recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
    <li> Thanks Vidal Sassoon for the FREE Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair color kit. The kit provides you with all you need to get that great hair color your looking for. I found the applicator brush very useful when applying to the roots in step one and the formula in step 2 made blending through the length of my hair a lot easier then colors I have used in the past. Not to mention how healthy and soft it left my hair. Great product, I definitely will purchase this in the future and recommend those who color their hair at home to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color. First of all I have rheumatoid arthritis and I had a hard time getting all of the product out of the tube and also applying it with the brush. It was just too many steps and my color came out ashy.</li>
    <li> I chose the light natural brown color for my hair and am in love with the color and the product! The amazing applicator products that are included make home hair colouring a breeze. The grey is gone in my hair completely and the colour adds a nice shimmer to my hair. I love the fragrance of the products, especially the conditioner which is nice and refreshing AND the tube of conditioner is big enough to be able to use at least 5 times....love this new product and can&#x27;t wait to try the reds:-)</li>
    <li> Really easy to apply and gave me the results I expected it too. I received this from the company to test out, A+!!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for years - most frequently at the salon, but occasionally I will purchase at home dye when I know I will have someone who can do it for me. Every single time I have dyed my hair at home I was disappointed. Too dark, too light, can still see the demarcation line between the roots and the coloured hair. So when I was given the opportunity to try Salonist free from Vidal Sassoon, I leapt at the chance! Their two step process makes all the difference - my roots and my ends turned out the exact same colour! It was easy to use, not messy, and smelled great! My hair felt so soft afterwards!</li>
    <li> I received this kit from Vidal Sassoon in the mail and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The two step process is wonderful! No more squirt bottles that squirted everything within 10 feet of me! They give you a pack of serum to apply to your hair after the color has been applied, this stuff is amazing, it seems to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; the color. After rinsing out the color, my hair is soft, silky and every inch of grey has been covered! My usual brand brings back some grey after about 3 days and it has been over a week and not one strand of grey! I am definitely switching to this brand!!!</li>
    <li> I’ve been dying my hair for years and Vidal Sassoon Pro series is my go-to home dye brand, so I was excited to get a free trial of  Vidal Sassoon Salonist in medium gold brown. I loved the product’s concept, becuase it’s a two-step process similar to how dye is applied separately on roots and ends when you go to a salon. From experience I know that my grey hair is resistant to dye, so I usually leave dye in for about 40 minutes to make sure my roots have time to fully process. Unfortunately I didn’t do that this time, and only let the roots process the 20 minutes stated in the instructions before I moved on to the second step of dying my ends. I wish I could say that my roots turned out the way they normally do, but that’s not the case. They are quite a bit lighter than the rest of my hair and I’m not sure they’ll grow out as evenly as they normally do when I use Vidal Sassoon Pro Series products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the Salonist instructions were easy to follow and were very thorough, the kit included really durable gloves (this isn’t normally the case with home dye kits), and I appreciated how easy the application process was with the mixing bowl and brush. On the minus side, I made a bit of a mess trying to mix the ingredients (it’s way easier to shake them together in a bottle versus stirring them in a bowl) and my hair doesn’t seamlessly blend from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I had high hopes for the Vidal Sassoon Salonist product, I think I’ll stick to using their Pro Series dyes because of the great results they consistently offer.</li>
    <li> This hair color was amazing!!  I loved the two part system and the brush that came with it.  It made it so much easier to apply to my roots first and blend into the rest of my hair when doing the second part.  My hair felt great afterwards and still to this fourth week later!.  The color has not faded and is still nice and shiny.  I loved that the smell was not overpowering and that I actually got to shampoo my hair after application, so that my hair did not smell freshly dyed.  I am so glad that I was picked by Vidal Sassoon to receive this product free to try!!  I will be using this product from now on!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my own hair for a few years. I always stick to the same product, but I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair color in the mail from BzzAgent for free. I decided to give it a try and was impressed. It colored the grey away that had started to come in and to my suprise was easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was excited to be chosen to try Vidal Sasson Salonist colour for free.  When the much anticipated package arrived I opened the package right away and read the directions.  They were overwhelming and seemed complicated.  After weeks of putting it off and finally begging my husband to help me with this we set to the project.    I went with blonde as that was what my hair was already colored as with some light brown roots that had grown in.  My husband separated my roots and applied them mixture as the instructions indicate to do.  Leave it on for 20 minutes and then apply the rest.  Dying the roots first was a major hassle, there was no way I could have done it myself and my husband found it tedious.    My hair is only shoulder length and while there was some mixture left over a person with longer or thicker hair will definitely need 2 boxes.  So we finally get all the dye in and wait for it to process.    In the instructions it says to use shampoo after you wash out the colour which I thought was different from any home hair colour I&#x27;ve used before.  The conditioner smells like coconuts and made me feel like I was on a tropical vacation while I was using it.   Probably the only enjoyable part of this for me.    When I got out of the shower, the first thing I noticed was my hair felt so damaged, it was dry and stringy.   I blow dried it to see how the colour came out.  It was super brassy and patchy with dark spots.  I don&#x27;t know if my roots were too long or what happened.  I&#x27;ve been dying my hair at home for many years and never had this happen.    I haven&#x27;t yet been able to re colour my hair because it is still quite brittle.    I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with my normal brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I was not very pleased.It was strong.Burned my head so I couldnt really leave in a long time.After 10 minutes it started to burn.Appliation wasnt very easy, Color not very vibrant.Wouldnt buy again.I did like the muxing bowl that came with it, and the gloves that came with the kit I git it free</li>
    <li> Got that salon experience with Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour in the privacy of my own home.  I used the Medium Gold Blonde, and not only did it give me beautiful all over color, but it also covered the white hair that doesn&#x27;t take to color to well!</li>
    <li> I was  at first nervous about my Vidal Sassoon Kit.  I hadn&#x27;t tried the brand in years and this kit had a lot of pieces, but after watching the video on the VS Site, I was ready to become beautiful. The kit contains a two-step process, one which involved &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; the roots and hairline with a brush and then after 20 minutes, adding the color serum to the rest of hair.  Easy.  I had no troubles at all applying the dye and the odor wasn&#x27;t offensive.  I did get some on my sink but it wiped up right away and it wasn&#x27;t due to dripping, it was due to my clumsiness.  After another 10 minutes, I washed the product out and used the VS shampoo that is supplied in the box and the conditioner instantly made my hair feel soft.  I could tell right away getting out of the shower that my hair was darker than I normally do it but that is okay, especially during winter months.  After blow-drying some of the wet out, I could tell right away I loved it.  The color is a rich chocolate brown and VERY shiny.  My hair styled easy and the lingering scent was nice, not over-powering like some other brands.  I got compliments on my hair color at work too.  One person even asked where I get my hair done.  It was fun to see the puzzlement on their face when I gave them my home address. Thanks Vidal Sassoon!</li>
    <li> I tried Vidal Sassoon Salonist kit, that the company sent to me free for sampling. Typically when I shop the hair color aisle, I reach for whichever is cheapest, without much thought to the brand.  I was delighted to give a new product a try, and it did not disappoint.  The instructions are very clear, the dyes and steps are clearly labeled.  The brush they provide in the kit helps get the color to all your roots.  They include a mixing bowl, the requisite gloves, and what I found the most delightful, enough color protecting conditioner to use again.  The cheaper brands barely supply enough for one use.  I haven&#x27;t priced the product in the stores yet, but I will consider spending a little more for this.  The color fully covers all the pesky grays.  Anyone that wants to avoid paying salon prices for salon quality hair color should give Vidal Sassoon Salonist a try.</li>
    <li> For the most part, this hair color is awesome, much more like an actual salon visit color. Its kind of putzy, and I actually had my boyfriend help me apply it, but the color was beautiful and my hair felt great after, soft and shiny. I colored it the week before I took a trip to Mexico, and it wasn&#x27;t long and my grays were showing through, so don&#x27;t know if it had to do with being in the hot sun more, or my hair just really grew fast, but the color didn&#x27;t last. I would definitely try it again though, so worth a try. Good smell, too</li>
    <li> Great product and so easy to use! No mess, love the brush so easy to make sure you get complete coverage. Color came out great. Would use again!</li>
    <li> neutral medium blond is really as name of color says  and is very natural ( other brands are more tricky and sometime surprising ). It takes longer time  and a little more effort but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> love it its very easy to use  colors are flawless</li>
    <li> I received a full size product to try from Vidal Sassoon and want to leave my opinion of it here. Now that several weeks have gone by since I colored my hair with Vidal Sassoon Salonist I feel I can give a good opinion of this wonderful hair color. I love it!!! Not only did it give me even looking color but it has been lasting quite well thru many washings. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the shade and will totally be buying more of it when it is time to do my hair again. Thank you Vidal Sassoon for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Received this product from vidal as a bzzagent for free.  Excellent product easy to apply and cover, excellent shade and depth to ad to your hair and easy on the nose with little odor. Only downfall is for those who are busy you do have to block a little bit more time out to use it since it is a 2 step product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to receive Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color from Vidal Sassoon for exchange of my honest opinion. I have to rave about how much I love Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color, my hair looks great. It covered all the strains of grey hair that I had and the color is exactly what I wanted.  What really impressed me was I was able to do all of my roots and the length of my hair, with the two step process. Without having to worry not having enough mixture to cover all of my hair. It was so easy to apply, and it looks like I had it professionally done at the Hair Dresser.  I really love how my hair looks healthy.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions as on the box for my current hair (dark blonde roots with highlights growing out).  I bought the 8/0 medium neutral blonde shade.  Before I started I called the customer help line because I was concerned that my roots would turn out brassy as previous color attempts.  I was told by one of their &#x27;experts&#x27; that since the color was a neutral I would not have any brassiness.  Well after the whole process my roots turned out quite brassy!!! The rest of my hair turned out fine, but I am dismayed at the roots!</li>
    <li> I was pleased as to how easy the two step process was. I found that applying the color to my roots and then the length of my hair covered my gray completely while coating my hair evenly. It turned out great and I will be buying this product in the future!</li>
    <li> A simple and effective way to maintain good quality hair coloring at home.  I don&#x27;t always like going to the salon so this is perfect for me.  Left my hair feeling great and loving my color!  Thank you for the trial item Vidal Sassoon!</li>
    <li> Received this product from the Brand. The best Hair Colour yet. It covered the grey in my hair with no fuss or mess. The odour is very mild and nice.i could color my hair without my eyes tearing. Very easy to use and nice to know my roots are easily colored now to.Box came in perfect shape. I thought it was going to be a long task to color my hair,but it was easy for me to do.Color turned out perfect.Brush for the roots to make sure my hair turns out with full coverage. Easy to mix together. Gave out some coupons and kept some myself.Want to change to Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent now. Try it and you will probably change to.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free from Vidal Sassoon. Must say that I loved the experience and results! The unique two-step process was easier to carry out than I thought. Great color in the end, all my greys were covered!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been leery of trying new hair coloring products because I usually end up with a shade that washes out my complexion or looks dull and bland. So, honestly, I was kind of hesitant when I signed up with BzzAgent to try the new Salonist coloring kit. The application process was a breeze and not as messy as others I&#x27;ve tried. (Usually, I end up with most of the color on my clothes instead of my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case this time). I have to say I was amazed at the results, and the brunette shade I chose looks very natural and not bland at all. It also didn&#x27;t dry out my hair either, which is another concern for me when I start looking for new hair products. So, thank you, Vidal Sassoon! I give Salonist two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Vidal Sassoon. I love it. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for many years. This kit is the quality of professional hair color. The two step process was easy. First I did my roots, waited the 20 mins, applied the serum to the remaining color and pulled it through my ends. The results were shiny, even, rich color. I used the nuetral black. Some at home kits left my hair with flat color. Salonist left my hair vibrant and shiny. Loved the results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got to try this through Bzzagent and I must say it was soooo easy to use, I love the tray and brush vs the bottle. Got excellent grey coverage and excited to see how long the grays stay gone! Will Defiantly make this my hair color of choice.</li>
    <li> The best cover up solution ever! I received this awesome product for free from Vidal Sassoon to test and review and let me tell you it was so easy to apply and it did the job just like a saloon would and i did it in the comforts of my own home and im sure its less expensive then going to a saloon! Its really just two easy steps a violla you have saloon perfect hair! Ive tried other products but it doesnt compare to this one!</li>
    <li> I received this from Vidal Sassoon via the BzzAgent program to try out for free.    This product contains EVERYTHING that you would need to dye your hair. I was amazed at how many things fit in the box! It came with a mixing bowl and a brush which are things that I have never seen included in a hair dye kit which is really convenient.    This kit includes the following:  - Tube of rich colour cream  - Bottle of colour activating lotion  - Sachet of VS Serum  - Tube of colour preserving conditoner  - Brush, bowl, gloves, and detailed instructions    The main difference of this hair dye than other boxed hairdye kits is that it is a two-step process, which may be confusing at first. You need to ensure that you read the instructions well ahead of time and not when you are in the middle of dying your hair.    The colour I received was 4/0 Dark Neutral Brown. My natural hair colour is already a dark brown so unless I bleach it, a hair dye wouldn&#x27;t really cause a dramatic difference to my hair colour. My main goal was just to hide any grey hairs that I have. This hair dye covered greys really well and it actually made them look dark brown like the rest of my hair. I have previously used ammonia free hair dyes and although they are less damaging to the hair, they always leave greys with a sort of reddish tint, so they are still noticeable even if they are no longer grey.    I am not sure if this product is sold in Canadian stores (Toronto area) as I have never seen it in various grocery and drug stores. I am guessing that it would be pretty pricey (maybe above $10) based on what is included in the box. However, considering you usually only need to dye your hair every few months, it would still be much cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
    <li> I was most excited when I received the product for free from Vidal Sassoon to try. The reviews are not based on that but my own opinion.  I have to say I loved Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a brush  with the gloves and trey. Wow no more messy on the glove and getting it all over.  It was so easy to use and the gloves actually fit my hands good without being too tight .  Very easy to use and I love the color.  It made my hair shiny and gorgeous I have been asked by many what salon I go to lol I told them Vidal Sassoon in the box lol..  I love it .</li>
    <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Kit from BzzAgent.  I usually color my hair at home every 4 months, so was very excited to be able to try out this new product.  I have to admit that I was a bit apprehensive at first since it seemed a lot more complicated than your typical at-home hair coloring products, but once I started the process I realized it wasn&#x27;t that difficult.  1) the creme went on thick which I liked since I didn&#x27;t drip color all over my bathroom floor like sometimes happens with the other products 2) I did not experience a burning sensation from  Vidal Sassoon Permanent kit like you do with some of the other products 3) the conditioner smells great 4) my hair did not feel damaged at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative comments is that it didn&#x27;t seem to cover all of my grey hairs and I was disappointed to find some greys the next morning, but I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who is interested in coloring their hair.</li>
    <li> I am a buzzagent and received this product to review. This product takes a bit more effort to use.  It is a nice overall hair color that you can do at home for a quarter of the price as getting it done at a salon.  Left my hair soft and looking great.</li>
    <li> I always dye my hair at home, and have for years. I just don&#x27;t have the time (or funds) to be constantly going to a salon. Usually I&#x27;m happy with the results for a week, and then it starts to look dull, or the colour starts to wash out. Not so with Vidal Sassoon Salonist. I got the \\&quot;Dark Neutral Brown\\&quot; as a trial from Vidal Sassoon, to just go about a shade darker than my normal colour. I am blown away by how vibrant my hair still looks, three weeks out.    My hair looks exactly the same as it did the day that I dyed it. The colour is so dark and rich, it&#x27;s absolutely stunning when the sun catches it. My husband has commented a few times on how soft it is too. I&#x27;ve changed nothing else in my routine, so I have to think the dye had something to do with it. It is a little bit more work than traditional at home hair dye kits, but then, I think that&#x27;s the point. The process is much closer to what you&#x27;d actually get at a salon, and clearly, the results are too. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I never colored my hair in home until now with VS Sasson Salonist this product is amazing, the results in my hair is the same from the salon. Plus the box contains everything the you need to do your hair gloves,brush and bowl in black color and high quality you feel expert with all this stuff. I am very happy with this product and more happy with the money i save doing my hair by my self in home. I received this sample product for free from Vidal Sasson Salonist.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use! I received a free box from VS. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years and have tried it all. This was different. I love how easy the hair color was to apply with the brush! A lot better than using a bottle. The color was spot on to what I wanted. All in all, great product.</li>
    <li> I received this hair color as a test product to review because I am a #BzzAgent. It is the best hair color product I have used. It adds shine, and the color is long lasting , and it has very little odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nice &#x27;n Easy for years to cover my gray.  It wasn&#x27;t anything special, but it got the job done.  Then I tried Vidal Sassoon Salonist and it truly was better.  The steps take a little getting used to, but are worth the effort in the end.  The result was a natural looking color that doesn&#x27;t look like it was just dyed.  It covered all the gray easily and completely.  Thanks to Bzzagent and Vidal Sassoon for letting me try it.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest and best color I have ever used, I used the Medium Natural Brown. The 2 step process makes sure that the hair is colored evenly with minimum fuss and mess. It covers grey/white hair perfectly making it look like highlights after a few shampoos. It is also the only color that gets you to shampoo out the color and then use the supplied conditioner instead of just rinsing it out with water until it runs clear. I would use this product again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS AS A FREE SAMPLE AND TRIED IT INSTEAD OF MY USUAL HAIR COLOR I COLOR MY HAIR TO HIDE THE GREY SO I WAS NOT SURE, BUT TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS SUPER EASY COVERED ALL THE GREY AND THE BEST PART IS ITS BEEN A MONTH AND THE COLOR STILL LOOKS GREAT I WILL BE BUYING SALONIST !</li>
    <li> I so love the color an the ease of 3 simple steps  love the results id highley recemened this product  an its so convient bein able to do it at home</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve used better. I truly think the salon is the way to go and use the root touch up in between. This did not cover the grey hair for very long. Faded pretty fast. It should come with 2 pairs of gloves due to tge process. And frankly there was not much shine and the colour was &#x27;meh&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I love how it covers the grey and it makes your hair smooth and strengthens it, And the color last a long time. Very easy to use and does not take alot of time to use it. I would highly recommend trying it for yourself and see if you get the same results like I did.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair color! I received this for review from Vidal Sassoon and was excited to try the brush application, as I&#x27;ve never tried this before. I am a brunette and tried the neutral black color, and it had amazing grey coverage! I was extremely impressed with the simplicity of application and the quality of the brush and gloves. After washing out and drying my hail, it felt surprisingly soft, rather than brittle like with most other dyes. I would definitely recommend this hair dye and will definitely be using it again myself!</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon sent me a box of their Salonist Permanent Hair Color in Medium Neutral Brown to try.  My main reason to dye my hair is to cover the lovely gray that has started to take over (being the Mom of 2 boys will do that quickly) and to even out the color from when I last colored my hair about 4 1/2 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, when I first read the directions for the two step process, I was a bit nervous.  The directions made it sound very easy, but I&#x27;m used to more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; home coloring kits. Once I got started tho, everything in the kit was well labeled and the directions were actually very easy to follow.  There was no question on which bottle/tube to mix when and the bowl and brush made the process even easier.  The mixing bowl, brush and gloves were all a very nice quality.  I did find parting and brushing the roots to be a bit tedious (when you are used to a using a pointed bottle tip to both part and apply the mixture, this is a bit more of a process) but I think it will become easier with practice.  I also noticed that the smell from the solutions were much  less potent than other coloring kits I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The smell there was, discipated quickly once I was done.  The conditioner left my hair feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most definitely happy with the color!  It is a very rich, natural looking brown.  It&#x27;s probably the closest match to my own hair color that I&#x27;ve used to date.  I typically go lighter or red because the browns I&#x27;ve used in the past never seemed to look quite right.  But I do believe I will be using this color from now on to keep my gray under control without worrying about a drastic difference when my roots start to grow.  After 2 weeks, the color is still strong and not faded at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this home hair coloring kit to others.</li>
    <li> I am a buzzagent for for buzzagent. I recieved my sample of VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR to try. I loved it. I like the two step procedure since I have grey hair and roots always show up. I like the brush on method over the bottle method. Keep up the great job Vidal Sassoon. I would recommend  VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR to everyone</li>
    <li> I really like doing my own hair with this at home kit, love the little bowl and brush, love the after color conditioner, I was a little fearful not knowing if I was going to do it right but instructions were great, love the 2 step process and my color turned out looking like I had kinda 2 colors but only in the light could I see that.I will use this kit again!</li>
    <li> As a 50 year old, I need to keep my grays at bay and getting salon time every 6 weeks is not always possible, I was skeptical to try this hair color at home, but now I am sold. It was easy, didnt smell horrific and covered my grays completely. Vidal Sassoon made at home hair coloring simple to do. This will now be a stock item in my bathroom cupboard!</li>
    <li> This product is great! the process is a bit long but it is worth it. helps hide the grey hairs and keeps your hair soft to the touch. it lasts a long time and after a month still doesn&#x27;t wash out. with the help of someone else it is easy to put in and make sure everything is proper. it is a great price and  great product. I received the product from the company and loved that i got the opportunity to use it.</li>
    <li> I liked that it came with a bowl and a brush but for my long hair it was only good for my roots. I did like that it didn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell like so many of the other brands do. It covered my greys nicely too! So that&#x27;s always extra points. One thing I wish company&#x27;s would though is make the bottles bigger or sell double bottle boxes for the ones who have the super long hair. Buying two kits isn&#x27;t necessary when all we need is just more dye not gloves and bowls, brushes and shampoo and conditioners. Overall it&#x27;s is a good product. I would like to see more colors.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how easy and effective this is! The color is awesome and it covers grey 100%. It doesn&#x27;t have a stinky chemical smell and it leaves hair feeling amazing! Definitely my new fave! I got a free box to try from Vidal Sassoon and now I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and LOVE it! The 2 step process was very easy and the instruction were very helpful. My hair went from a dull brown, to a vibrant brown. The tones are so rich in color and my hair is so shiny! I will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the new Vidal Sassoon salonist color. They do have a very nice range of colors to choose from. There were pros and cons to this hair color.&lt;br /&gt;A few of the pros were:&lt;br /&gt;1. clear directions&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice color choices.&lt;br /&gt;3. The color was not flat at all and reflects light well.&lt;br /&gt;4. My color was vibrant and has seemed to last fairly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the cons for me were:&lt;br /&gt;1. I am not fan of the way you have to mix the first part and then save the other portion to mix after. I would prefer to mix all at once and just save some aside like other dyes I use. I really don&#x27;t feel that mixing separately really added any great step to this process vs a regular touch up application with another brand of dye .&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t care for the bowl &amp; brush as the only as application method. I like to use a bottle application because it is much easier with my thick hair. The brush is handy for certain areas but not the whole application.&lt;br /&gt;3.  If there are two steps which require gloves to be worn, I think they should include a second pair of gloves so we don&#x27;t have to carefully pull off the gloves to use for second step. For the price point I think they could include a second pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the color and would probably use this again using a manufacturer coupon as I think the retail price is a bit too high. I am a bargain/coupon shopper so I prefer to not pay full price. The color was vibrant and lasts a good amount of time. My hair didn&#x27;t look unhealthy after but it didn&#x27;t feel as good as I would have hoped it would feel after. When I use Garnier Nutriesse my hair usually feels soft and silky after, this was not the case with this color. I have just been using a deep conditioner for that. I have gotten several compliments on my hair color since I have colored it. I received a FREE SAMPLE of this dye through bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I have always been impressed with Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s products, so when I had the chance to try it for free, I was excited! When the kit came I have to say I was a little overwhelmed.  There were so many parts to it that I have to admit that I waited a few weeks.  In that time, the gray in my hair sparkled more and more, until I knew it was time...I had to quit procrastinating!  I chose the medium golden brown to color my hair with.  It was a great choice for my skin tone.  Let me say that I was so concerned about the 2-system approach, but I was wrong.  This kit is so easy to use.  Mix the &amp;#34;1&#x27;s&amp;#34; together using the brush.  The mixture is fairly thick which is nice.  No more dripping down my neck or my forehead.  Brush all the root areas with 3/4 of the mixture then wait 20 minutes.  Mix the &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; into the remaining mixture again using the brush, then mix into your hair using your hands.  Wait 10 minutes, rinse, condition and you&#x27;re done!  I have to say that the color is even throughout, no streaking.  My scalp isn&#x27;t discolored either, like it normally is when I color my hair.  I highly recommend this kit to everyone who wishes to color their hair at home.  #vidal sassoon #salonist #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 30 years, including doing highlights, etc. I&#x27;ve used boxed color and mixed my own and, occasionally, even had my color done at a salon. I&#x27;m telling you, the Vidal Sassoon Salonist color is THE most beautiful color I&#x27;ve ever had! EVER! The gray coverage is outstanding. There was no lightened &amp;#34;striping&amp;#34; at the gray line and the color blended perfectly on both grays and previously colored hair alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a newcomer to home color, or if you&#x27;ve done boxed color with the bottle applicator only, the two-step, brush on color will take a little bit of a learning curve. I&#x27;ve used a brush before and it&#x27;s a little messier than the bottle applicator but, boy, does it give the best control of where and how much color to distribute. Every boxed color I&#x27;ve ever used advises that, for root touch ups, you apply color to roots then, 10 minutes or so before you&#x27;re done processing, distribute to ends to get the best color results. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don&#x27;t. If I don&#x27;t, the ends will hold more color than the roots and give a darker look. The Salonist breaks this down into steps and adds product to the color you apply to the ends so it almost forces you to be patient and do the two-step process. It&#x27;s soooooooo worth it. This color is dimensional, shiny, rich, just beautiful. I truly cannot say enough about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to haircolor. I know it&#x27;s brand new but, please Vidal Sassoon, never stop making this color!</li>
    <li> I was so surprised when i open my Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color..Love the packaging..It is a two step process but very east to do.I first started with the roots and you leave the product on for 20 minutes..Then I did the second part of my hair left that on for 10 minutes..Rinsed it off.It&#x27;s very easy..Love that it came with the tray and brush which made it so easy to apply to my roots..The color is fantastic.I have got so many complainments on my hair color..People asked me what salon did i go to..They couldn&#x27;t believe this was done at home..I was so lucky to recieve this product from Vidal Sasoon for free to review.I really recommend it..You will love the way your color comes out and how shiny your hair looks.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR for free from the brand in exchange of my honest opinion. I love the finished product - the two step process (first the roots and then all over hair color mixed with a clear gloss) result in built in highlights - the color is not flat - and my hair was left shinier. The color also covers stubborn grays (not that I would have any...LOL). I also want to mention that the hair color product does not irritate my scalp (as other products sometimes do) and the instructions are well written. The conditioner lasts for up to six weeks and it conditions hair well after the process (it did not leave my hair dry). Highly recommend. I used the Light Brown shade - and it is truly a light brown - not too dark or dull.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my life knows how I am against using boxed hair colour. I was secretly super excited to be given an invite to this Vidal Sassoon campaign, but of course a little weary at the same time. When I received the package and opened it up, I was really surprised - it came with not only the colouring products, but also a mixing bowl, a brush that is even worth keeping, and a pair of latex gloves (not the crappy ones you usually get with box colour). I found that the smell of the product once mixed wasn&#x27;t as horrible as some hair colours and it was also the perfect consistency, it wasn&#x27;t too thick and it wasn&#x27;t too runny. My only complaint would be that the mixing bowl is sort of a weird shape which makes it hard to mix the product together, it also creates a little mess. I got great results in the end and I&#x27;ve been really excited for this line of colour to be released, because I am going to start purchasing it! This product was given free of charge to review through BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon salonist hair color system for  free from BzzAgent. I used this product and was very pleased with the outcome. At first it seemed a bit complicated but I soon got the hang of it and completed the process. I have gotten so many compliments from friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is so easy to use, comes with everything you need to get a great salon like hair color. The step by step instructions are easy to understand and for the most part it did not take that long to do, maybe 2 hours total and that&#x27;s with a shower. I would buy this product to use at home and i would even tell all my friends about it. I was surprised that it matched my hair color I had used from another product so good. It covered my gray roots really well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect! I received it from my Bzz Agent and when I tried it, I knew it would be my last time going to a high priced salon. The tow simple steps left me with silky, shiny and manageable hair. Thinking I can save 70.00 every 3 months is just incredible! Thank you Vidal Sassoon!!</li>
    <li> I liked it so much.  I am a Bzzagent and I had the chance to receive a sample and try it for free.  It&#x27;s simple,so easy in two stages. The first to make the roots, after an exposure time of 20 minutes, mixing the rest of mixture (1/4 of the product which was used for the roots) with serum included in the package. The serum will be used to revive the color and nourish hair to let shimmering and revived. There is then another 10 minutes of installation and our hair is then washed as usual and apply conditioner included in the package that will keep the shiny side of the color. The hair is soft, silky and shiny. And besides, it hides all the gray hair.  #Sponsored, #VidalSassoon,#Salonist</li>
    <li> I just had the opportunity to try Vidal Sassoon Salonist for free from Vidal Sassoon. First, let me say the application method was easy. Having a brush to apply color to my roots was much easier than the bottle method of old. Of course, it was a challenge when coloring the back of my head but what @ home coloring isn&#x27;t in that respect. I felt confident about getting color @ all of my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose a shade close to my natural color albeit slightly lighter as my main objective was to get rid of the pesky grays! I loved the results! Vidal Sassoon Salonist left me w/ a natural tone complete w/ highlights &amp; did well to cover the grays turning them blonde &amp; complementing my overall color. My hair was shiny, soft &amp; looks great as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband commented of all the hair coloring kits I&#x27;ve used this is 1 of the few that left such a natural look &amp; I completely agree! I waited until just prior to Christmas to see who in my family would notice. Both mom&#x27;s complimented me &amp; asked what I&#x27;d used. I even got a compliment from my dad-in-law! Friends &amp; co-workers asked what&#x27;s different &amp; said it looks good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the color results one of the very best things about Vidal Sassoon Salonist was the smell of the chemicals during application &amp; the conditioner provided. The chemical smell was not in any way overwhelming &amp; even smelled good. Being told to shampoo your hair after rinsing is definitely a plus in my book as this is rare based upon my past experience. It gets rid of any residual coloring chemical smell &amp; the conditioner provided smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing- I got color on exposed skin on my neck that i did not realize until I was about to rinse &amp; not only did it come off w/ only water but it did not stain my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative- If you have long hair you will need to get 2 boxes. I have very long hair (all the way down my back) &amp; there was certainly not enough product in 1 box to easily cover it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will most definitely purchase this product again!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will most definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Great product, great color and it includes all the professional tools required to  get the job done right. I will continue to use this product for the rest of days. Thanks Vidal  Sasson for allowing me the opportunity to try this amazing product.</li>
    <li> When I went to use it....I made sure to read ALL the directions first before using because this was a bit different then the usual hair coloring that I buy. It&#x27;s a bit more involved.  I will say that the directions (if not read carefully) can be a bit confusing.  I had to read them several times before I finally got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit confused with what to do w/ the remaining mixture from step one...after reading a few times, I did get to understand that I keep it in the bowl and keep it covered until I&#x27;m ready to mix w/ step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend reading and re-reading the directions completely before using to make sure you know exactly what to do and when.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to use and apply to the hair. I made sure to heavily cover the areas that were more gray. However, when it was done...it didn&#x27;t seem to cover the grays the way I would have liked it too. The grays were just a lighter shade and didn&#x27;t match the rest of the color. You could tell that I was more gray in those particular areas (around the frame of my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I was able to shampoo after I rinsed out the colourant, which is something you can&#x27;t do with the others. Shampooing always gives my hair a softer feel. The conditioner they give you to use only adds to the softness. (However, after I used all of the conditioner, I read in the directions that the tube contains up to 6 weekly treatments.  Guess I wasn&#x27;t suppose to use all of it.  So please make sure to be aware of that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the product and once I understood everything I was suppose to do, it was very simple to apply. While I do wish it covered the grays a bit better, I DO LOVE the color and I&#x27;m anxious to see how long the color will last before having to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much !</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from Vidal Sassoon. I have been coloring my hair for several years, and this by far is the best at-home color I&#x27;ve encountered. The brush makes it simple to apply, and the no-drip formula keeps the color in my hair, not on the bathroom counter or floor. The color is rich, shiny and long lasting. It certainly can give your salon color a run for its money!</li>
    <li> I received this from Vidal Sassoon to try for free. My first thought was fun a bowl and brush instead of a bottle. It got better because they focus on your roots first then wait and then apply to all over. The smell is a normal dye smell but after you condition it smells really good. The color was very nice. Almost back to my original color!! And my gray was gone! Now after a few weeks I&#x27;m still very happy! My hair feels and looks healthy! I used the cool med brown. First picture was day one next one a few weeks later. Sorry different light but still loving the color.</li>
    <li> I received a free box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Premanent and its the best I ever tried. I do not have any gray anymore. I have tried alot of other colorings but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I used this several weeks ago and i still love it. It was easy to apply and i didn&#x27;t make a mess all over the place like with other coloring kits i&#x27;ve used. My color is still going strong and my hair has never been softer. I get several comments on how nice it looks. Will using this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour Permanent kit and I have to say that this hair color beats every other one I have tried hands done. It&#x27;s absolutely mind blowing how easy the two step process it and to say my hair looks gorgeous is a huge understatement. EVERYONE that has seen my new hair color was blown away at how gorgeous the color is, how soft and shiny my hair is and the compliments were endless. I have used the same brand for years and before trying Vidal Sassoon Salonist I was very happy with it and how very mistaken I was. Vidal Sassoon most definitely has a winner and I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone and anyone that colors their hair at home and for those of you that don&#x27;t you might want to consider it with this product. I can&#x27;t think of any negative when it comes to this product it is 100% a winner. Thank you VIdal Sassoon for the opportunity to try your product and it is now my new product as long as it stays on the market I WILL be buying it.</li>
    <li> This was by far the BEST home coloring kit I have ever used. I have tried every brand in the book. I have very stubborn gray hair and the coverage was fantastic. There has been zero fading as well. High quality products and super easy to use. I am a big fan. I received the kit for free to sample, talk about, and review.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use...and I absolutely love the color payoff on my hair! Most dyes that I have used in the past don&#x27;t last very long - but this one has!</li>
    <li> I was very nervous to dye my hair on my own but the two step process made it very easy and only about 40 minutes. Painting the gray in the roots and then doing the rest helped , my hair is long and I was not sure it was enough but it was. I like my color and hope it lasts.i received this kit from buzzagent to try and give my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this product I recently received a free box to try from Vidal Sasson and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It was an easy two-step process that left my hair soft and shiny. The color was very vibrant and lasted for weeks. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was having to reuse the gloves I wish the would include a second pair for the next step. Highly recommend this to anyone who dyes their hair.</li>
    <li> When I first received an invite for VS Salonist Haircolor, I was pretty excited because I was in need of a fresh update on my haircolor. But, I was quickly disappointed that there was no auburn being offered. So, I settled with Dark Neutral Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got myself ready to color, I opened the package and was a little worried about the amount of items included. I was a bit daunted to have more than the usual, and then once I looked at the instructions I was even more worried. I&#x27;m used to simple boxed hair color that you just mix 2 bottles, apply and rinse. This kit included one step, mixing 2 bottles into a tray, then a 2nd step adding more to the saved remaining amount. But, I went along with it. I must say that the front of my head wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle, but boy, when I got to the back, having to section out my hair blindly was a chore! I&#x27;m not priviledged enough to have a second mirror in my bathroom, so this was quite a feat. I literally closed my eyes and hoped for the best, as I felt around hoping to come at least slightly close to the recommended sectioning of color application.  Once I was done with the first step, I waited, with gloves on, because I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d get them clean and dry enough to just &amp;#34;take off and save for step 2&amp;#34;. My kids laughed at me, saying I looked like an anime character because my hair was sticking up all over the place. After 20 mins, I proceeded to step 2 of mixing remaining items and applying with a big handful of solution. I actually liked this part, because it was simple and quick. I waited the last 10 minutes, then jumped in the shower for the color rinse. I did like that using shampoo was recommended, since no other hair color has ever offered this step. Once I rinsed out shampoo, applied some of the color refresher conditioner, and rinsed that, I was done. I&#x27;d say my hair looks pretty good (despite the dark brown vs. my usual auburn colors), and feels silky. Not sure I&#x27;ll actually ever go to this extreme again, I prefer the simpler hair coloring boxes.</li>
    <li> Loved the hair color!  O would recommend this to any one! I got mine free through bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I received my Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color just in time to dye my hair for Christmas.  A quarter inch of gray was bleeding through to ruin my hair color, so I was excited to try the new Vidal Sasson Salonist Hair Color System.  Step 1 to mix tube solution and liquid solution, was the hardest for me.  The tube cream solution was so thick, I had a hard time squeezing the cream from the cap end.  So I finally cut off the other end of the tube to remove the cream solution into the mixing bowl.  After the slight delay, I was off to coloring my hair.    I loved the expert brush, to help cover all my roots. The step one solution didn&#x27;t run it was very stable on my roots.  Step 2 the serum solution mixed with remaining step 1 solution, was easy to pull through the rest of my hair.  After waiting 10 minutes, the color preserving conditioning rinse was also easy.  I noticed right away the amount of hair loss was minimal in the sink drain, compared to other home hair colors I&#x27;ve used in the past.    I chose the medium cool brown which was gorgeous and very close to my own hair color.  Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair color is even to the ends, and my hair feels healthier and softer on my long hair tresses.  I totally recommend Vidal Sassoon hair color, for anyone who wants a great result in a home hair coloring system.  You&#x27;ll  truly achieve Salon results with Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color.      Thanks BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try the new Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color product, I&#x27;ll certainly buy this product again!    I received Vidal Sasson Salonist Hair Color product free, I love being a BzzAgent!!</li>
    <li> Resistant Gray is No longer a word in my vocabulary.  Vidal Sassoon Salonist has taken care of that.  There was a time I couldn&#x27;t wear my hair back off of my forehead because the area of gray there would not hold color.  I don&#x27;t know how they managed it, but after using the gray is finally gone.  This hair dye does not burn your eyes from the fuels and it smells nice.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments that I&#x27;ve stopped counting. As a member of Bzz Agent I was given this product free to review.</li>
    <li> I tried the vidal sassoon salon is hair color thanks to Bzzagent and vidal Sassoon. It&#x27;s great! The cool brown just pops. My hair looks and feels great. Its been a week, so far the color is lasting and still has my hair looking and feeling healthy. Yes I would recommend this to friends and family. I love my hair.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this hair color direct from Vidal Sassoon to try out.  Love the fact that it had both a tray and a brush to apply the color to my hair.  It is a two step process first is to apply to roots with a one set of ingredients than at the end you add to the ingredients and apply it to the rest of the hair to just update your existing color.  The color I got looks wonderful and it was very easy to use.  My hair is very soft and not damaged at all.  The only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is due to the fact that I have grey hair and after coloring my hair the roots looks a little lighter where the grey was growing out compared to the end of the hair.</li>
    <li> Rich.Shiny.Beautiful. I was so pleased with the results after using VS Salonist Hair Color. It was easy (I am a novice) and quick. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have had a difficult time finding an &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; hair color that would match the look of a salon while covering the grays at the same time. This product provided such a pretty, rich color and 100% of coverage after just one use! It takes a two step approach to coverage, attacking the stubborn roots separately then addressing the rest of your hair for all over coverage. It is FANTASTIC not to mention saving me tons from trips to the salon!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00OP207GQ Vidal Sassoon  Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Color Kit, 3/0 Darkest Neutral Brown]]I was recently selected by Vidal Sassoon to try Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s new Salonist Permanent Hair Color in Neutral Darkest Brown 3.0. My hair is really thick and long so going to a salon for regular touch-ups is pricey. When money is tight and I color my hair at home, I opt only for a semi-permanent color. Consider this a lesson I learned from my fearless 20&#x27;s. I am not at all skilled at evenly applying hair color and I once selected a color that was too dark for my hair. It took a new haircut and several months to ever recover from it. To receive a permanent hair color from Vidal Sassoon, a brand I haven&#x27;t ever tried before, well, the thought did cross my mind that I could be making the same mistake twice. However, when I received the product and looked over the details, it gave me the courage to give it a try.    The Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color is unique compared to other hair color products I&#x27;ve used. For instance, the product is a two-step process and the box included a mixing tray (with lid), an application brush, black latex application gloves (not flimsy plastic!) and easy step-by-step instructions that include glossy color photos of each application step. By the way, that time years ago when I chose the too dark color? I got used to seeing the happy smiling girl on the box of the correct color for me. Only, the brand decided to revamp their packaging. Gone was my happy smiling girl and in her place was rows and rows of different shades of brown. I felt abandoned, left with only my lousy memory and an overwhelming array of browns to choose from. Was it Nutmeg? Was it dark brown? Was it darkest brown? Was it happy squirrel brown? Was it happy squirrel eating a dark walnut brown or was it angry brown squirrel hungry for a peanut brown? I took a risk and picked the wrong one (I should have picked Nutmeg). Anyway, with this product Vidal Sassoon has mecovered. One of the interior box tabs contains the name of the color I&#x27;m using and marked it with a dotted line as if to say, \\&quot;Fear not sweet Robin. Tear this tab here and store it in your wallet and you will never be traumatized by incorrectly choosing the wrong hair color ever again.\\&quot; Thank you Vidal Sassoon!    Now on to the application. Thanks to the color photos accompanying the instructions, I found the application process itself to be pretty intuitive and easy. I&#x27;m used to dumping a couple products into a bottle, shaking it up and crossing my fingers that it&#x27;s mixed well and then squeezing it all over my head only to get half the product on my hair and the other half on my clothes, towel, family dog, you get the idea. With this product you get none of that. Step one has you mix a portion of the product in their enclosed tray and apply to the root with their applicator brush. This means not only are you seeing exactly how thoroughly you&#x27;ve mixed the product but you&#x27;re also applying it exactly where it needs to go. With long hair like mine, every drop counts. So, any drop I can keep on my hair and off the family dog is a great thing. Oh and did I mention the scent is quite lovely? It is. It&#x27;s not that offensive \\&quot;Hey-I-have-chemicals-all-over-my-head-so-you-probably-shouldn&#x27;t-risk-lighting-a-candle-near-me\\&quot; smell. Instead, it smells like shampoo. Like, \\&quot;Sure,-you-could-light-that-candle-near-me-but-I-don&#x27;t-know-why-you&#x27;d-want-to. Have-you-smelled-my-hair?\\&quot; Step two is to add in the enclosed serum to the remaining product and mix again. I will say that it would be super helpful for this product to have enclosed 2 sets of gloves. To use the same pair on and off and on again for step two is a bit of a nuisance. Also, if you have larger hands these gloves may not fit or even break. So, gloves are a must particularly for step 2 as this time you take the glob of product out of the tray and work it through the rest of your hair with your hands. No worries though, the product is so thick and creamy I didn&#x27;t have to worry about having it dripping and staining all over my clothes. Now some may be turned off a bit by the amount of time it takes to apply the product and wait for it to settle in on step one only to apply product to the remainder of your hair and wait an additional ten minutes for it to settle in for step two. To which I say, we seem to spend a lot of time in our lives rushing. Rushing to get in line, rushing here, rushing there. And sure, some things should be rushed, like an awkward encounter with an ex for example. However, applying hair color? No, it&#x27;s not one of the those things that should be rushed. After all, you don&#x27;t want to run in to an ex looking like a zebra do you? Of course not.    Now on to the results. I look like a zebra. Just kidding. It was time to rinse out the product and I noticed that this product does not contain color safe shampoo to do this so make sure you already have some on hand. When I rinsed out the product I definitely noticed I didn&#x27;t have a lot of color wash out. I took that as a good sign the color was actually on my hair instead of down the drain like my typical product I use. This product does come with conditioning creme that I left in for 2 minutes before washing out and styling my hair. The conditioning creme is wonderful and I was so happy to see they enclosed enough of it for 6 shampoos! Score! Like I mentioned before, the product I used was neutral darkest brown and my hair is naturally dark brown as it is so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of a change. That&#x27;s a good thing because I wasn&#x27;t wanting a big change, rather, I just wanted to give my hair color a boost. This did the trick. I was expecting a boring flat brown color, instead I got neutral really dark brown but with noticeable shine. My hair is soft and fluffy and smells great to boot. I&#x27;m thrilled! I&#x27;ve attached a picture of my results and I will be posting a video on YouTube soon as well, just search #VidalSassoon #Salonist#Sponsored to find it.</li>
    <li> This Vidal Sassoon colouring kit was the best i&#x27;ve used yet, and i&#x27;ve been colouring my hair at home and in the salons for over 30 years.It was easy to use...and it came with gloves , a mixing container and a root brush applicator.There were no noxious odours at all!The instructions came with step by step pictures to show you exactly what to do.I received a free colouring kit to use, from Vidal Sassoon, and i definitely will be buying this!My hair was a gorgeous colour and soft, not dry at all.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzzagent and received a free sample of Vidal SASSOON Salonist Permanent Hair color to try. I love the color choices and the easy  2 step application of roots then rest of hair. I Loved that it was less  messy than other products to apply with good results. Only negative things  was need to leave dye on longer for 2nd step for color to a match and take to hair. Still great color afterwards loved the technique used to apply it. Definitely would recommend to try!</li>
    <li> This kit is great! It was super easy to use, everything you need is included. The tray used to put the mix in is sturdy and had a root brush and good gloves (not the ones that rip on you) and there are only a few steps to all of this. I&#x27;m used to using bottle dye so I was a little unsure at first but the directions they provide are easy to read and do. There isn&#x27;t a strong smell to the dye either, some dye smells gag me and run me out of my bathroom for fresh air. The dye applied very easily, and rinsed just as well. The conditioner they give is great too, after drying my hair it was very soft and silky, not like the hay hair I&#x27;ve had before. There also wasn&#x27;t any after dye smell to my hair either. I will defiantly use this next time.</li>
    <li> I received the Neutral Black kit from Vidal Sassoon to review. I will say, the prep is a lot more than the usual home kits. You have two steps to do to achieve the color. The directions are very clear and they provide all the tools you need. Does not have an overpowering smell and the results were well worth it! My color is very even and has a nice sheen to it. Definitely will be using again.</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color from Vidal Sassoon. I choose medium golden brown. It is the closest to my my  natural hair color and right now I do have highlights in my hair. I was excited to try this two-step process. I did have some problems with this hair color. Although the box was not damaged apparently the tray was and I did not notice it so after I put the color in the tray then added the liquid color activator it went out the bottom of the tray all over my bathroom counter tops! Luckily I had an old towel underneath or it would have been a bigger mess. I salvaged what I could had to get my own bowl and put the color on hoping that it activated right. I put 3/4 on waited and then put the other 1/4 on with a serum then pulled it through the rest of my hair. It was a little time consuming. The problem with the two-step process is that you have to re-use the gloves again they should include 2 sets and the mixing tray included is cheap. My bathroom was a big mess. My hair did turn out alright. It was look shiny and was soft but the process was kind of a pain.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to BzzAgent and Vidal Sasson and it is AMAZING! The directions were very easy to read, and the 2-step process left my hair feeling soft, conditioned, and the color was amazing!!! I highly recommend this product if your used to going to the salon. You can get salon quality color at home!! #GotItFree #VidalSassoon #Sponsored</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour from the company. I was unsure if I could do this hair color with the brush and doing different sections at a time. I was pleasently surprised how easy it was and it&#x27;s the only color that I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t turn my hair red!! My hair is very shiny and so soft.</li>
    <li> I really was not sure if I wanted to use this product. I got the box read all the information and decided it would be a easy way to color my hair. I got everything out of the box and began to color my hair. It was a easy two step process . I am so glad I decide to color my hair. It made me feel much younger and look much younger . The color was a little darker than shown on the box. but I love ItJust don&#x27;t let fear stop you from coloring your hair, just do it and you will love it</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Vidal Sassoon and and at first was really impressed. I chose medium brown and it looked great...but the color faded quick. Ill admit it was my first time of using the two step process  but it was easy to use and it was less of a mess than my normal type which I loved.</li>
    <li> i gave my friend my hair-color i received for free from Vidal Sassoon. It was for a campaign. My friend told me the color didn&#x27;t come out rt n it was actually lighter then it was supposed to b. She has dark hair n it came out as a light worn brown looking color. She was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received a trial of this product (darkest neutral brown) from BZZAgent.  I was excited to try this product, as I find salon color to be a waste of money.  My hair does not hold color very well, and only lasts a few weeks, even if professionally done.  I found the color to be very vibrant, and has stayed so for the past two weeks.  I think this product would be easy to use for any user.  My only complaint:  I have a pixie cut, and found that I needed to skip to step two.  By the time I had applied the color to my roots, my whole head was covered.  I kept the color on for five minutes, then skipped to step two.  I kept that portion on for 20 minutes.  The smell is almost non-existent, which is a great plus!  I would definitely recommend this product, and will use again.</li>
    <li> I received from Vidal Sassoon their Salonist Hair Color to try for free. I have had grey hair since my teen year due to my family history, but most of the grey hairs were concealed under the rest of my hair. Since 3 years ago became evident that I have grey hair because it started showing specialy in the crown of my head. So, I been coloring my hair since them and I have tried most of the grey covering solutions offer in the market. When I first hear about this product through Bzzagent, I was exited to try it, so I requested neutral Black.&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;The color looks very natural against my skin tone and it is quite similar to the color I had chosen at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The grey coverage is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp was a bit dry for after I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results and I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Vidal Salonist is a great item! The two step process is magnificent! You get salon treatment out if a box really, I received a kit  from Vidal Sassoon try yours today! It</li>
    <li> I received my free kit from Vidal Sassoon Salonist and was very excited to give it a try.  I love how it concentrates on your roots.  With other hair coloring kits, you just mix it up and apply all over your hair.  With this, the main goal is to concentrate on your roots.  You are given a brush to help cover all your roots..from front to back.  You let it sit for awhile before you apply to the rest of your hair.  If you are interested in a professional look that you can do yourself at home, check out this product.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to try out this new product and I must say I was very surprised, I loved the ease of use and the color was just wonderful. It is a great product for much cheaper than you would pay the saloon to do. Thanks to Vidal Sassoon for allowing me to try this product #GotitFree My opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I loved this colour. I thought it went on well and has lasted some time now!&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of this is the tedious mixing. It&#x27;s great to have the salon effect and all, but since it doesn&#x27;t come in a bottle you have to stir it and to ensure it&#x27;s stirred properly you have to stir it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love the way it works and the process (after the mixing!) and I love the salon effect in my own home!</li>
    <li> I obtained this product free from VS to try. I found the process to be somewhat cumbersome, but the results were great. The product has a two step process that requires you to first mix part of the product to cover your roots. Then the next step is to mix another part of the solution to then cover all of your hair. The product did not have a strong chemical smell and my hair was soft after using. It worked great to cover my greys and the final color was great. The color also seems to be long lasting even several weeks later.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try Vidal Sassoon Hair Colour. I like it a lot,  the two step was easy and in the end my hair look and felt great.. I will use it again in the future....great product, does a great job on taken the gray and leaveing wonderful color...</li>
    <li> I received this kit from Vidal Sassoon.for free.  I was very curious to see what this color kit could offer.  I loved the ease of the instructions.  How well everything was packaged for easy use.  The bonus is the extra large tube of conditioner so that with long hair there was plenty and enough for additional use.  I have medium length hair to my bra strap.  It is very concerning as most color kits never have enough color for longer hair.  This kit completely does.  It did not burn my scalp nor did it have an unpleasant smell.  It was wonderful from start to finish.  I am not a hairdresser and had concerns with how to do my roots properly but let me just say.  The instructions teach the steps so easily.  I love my color.  I love the shine my hair has. This is my new favorite thing.  It is priced right and if you are pressed for time and can&#x27;t get into your salon.  This is your product.  I don&#x27;t see me going to the salon for color anymore.  Why pay for something that I can do just as well in the comfort of my own home.  This is a huge hit.  Color is fabulous.  The ease of the product makes it worth it.  I love love love this.</li>
    <li> Color Name: 4/0 Dark Neutral Brown&lt;br /&gt;I received this through BzzAgent to try. I have been dying my hair for since I was 16 (lets just say) MANY years!  After many years of doing it myself, I went to salon after salon trying to find someone who would  dye my hair just the way I wanted. Easier said than done. After years  finding a stylist who would of course move on etc. &amp; thousands of dollars later, I decided to return to coloring my myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it had been years, I was scared I would mess it up. But OMG this is SO easy even my fiancé could do it!! In fact he did help me and I am happy &amp; proud to say we did it!!! It is so easy to use and quick. I am very happy with the results the true test was getting compliments from friends and coworkers-they all love my color!! Thank you Vidal Sassoon!!!! . #VidalSassoon #Salonist</li>
    <li> Too many steps, not enough coverage and over priced</li>
    <li> I received a free box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist to try out. I am a professional hairstylist,  so I thought this was a great product to try out on myself. I have pretty short hair and some white around the temples. I feel like this might be too many steps for the average person to do at home, or even want to do at home. I personally just put the color all over for 20 minutes and it did fine. I think if your hair is heavile colored or two toned, this would be a great product to use.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a free box of Salonist to try from Vidal Sassoon!! I love this system and will definitely be buying another in the future. I absolutely love this new Salonist coloring system!!!  The instructions are very easy to follow!!!  The brush and gloves and mixing bowl make application a breeze!!!  And the end result..the glow, the shine and even rich color is salon quality!!!  It is a great price, easy and the beautiful result makes this a MUST BUY!!</li>
    <li> So for the time and effort it took mixing this up and waiting, I was a little disappointed with the results.  I was hoping that it would have darkened my highlights a little better.  It did bring good color to the length though.  I think it is a lot easier to use when someone is helping you to apply it. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received this through BzzAgent and strive to be honest and fair in reviews. While this isn&#x27;t my favorite it&#x27;s not the worst. I love the way the color came out but the two step process wasn&#x27;t the easiest especially with kids running around. I don&#x27;t know that I would use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always dying my hair and have used different brands many of which leave my hair blochy or the color doesn&#x27;t last. That being said I tried Vidal sasson for free through bzzagent.com and was excited to see how this would react w my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply in my hair. Once I rinsed I was amazed at how wonderful n healthy my hair felt using the conditioner. The color is beautiful and held in my hair wonderfully. It&#x27;s the healthiest my hair has ever felt after dyeing it and I&#x27;m super happy to have got to try this!! If u get the chance to try Vidal sasson hair coloring I would highly recommend it! I&#x27;ve used many brands and am now a loyal customer to Vidal Sassoon! That&#x27;s how amazing it is!!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a free trial and I have to say I LOVE IT!!  It was so easy to use....the brush made it so easy.  Cream was nice and thick so it didn&#x27;t run while applying it.  It definitely covered my grays and provided so much shine and softness.  I am very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Vidal Sassoon Salonist product and I must say I was very very impressed.  Color is awesome, product was very easy to use and very gentile on my hair!! #VidalSassoon, #Salonist and #Sponsored #GotItFree</li>
    <li> RECEIVED VIDAL SASSON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR FROM VIDAL SASSON LOVE WHAT IT HAS DONE TOOK ALL MY GREY AWAY LEFT MY HAIR VERY SOFT AND FULL OF BODY USED IT ABOUT 6 WEEKS AGO IT IT LIKE I JUST DID IT VERY NICE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this product from bzzagent in a shade most closest to my natural color. I liked the two-step process, it really was comparable to a salon experience. A few weeks later I went to my local drug store and used the coupons that were sent with my sample kit and purchased the deep intense violet. I love it! I&#x27;m going it stick with this color for awhile.</li>
    <li> When I received my hair color from Vidal Sassoon I was super excited. I went from dull, on some days oily and on others very dry hair, and frizzy to very manageable, healthy, and shining hair. The process was fast and the directions easy. Give Vidal Sassoon a chance and treat yourself to a new you!  #got it free #vidal Sassoon #got a coupon</li>
    <li> I received a free box of the hair coloring from Vidal Sassoon and I love it! It left my hair smooth, healthy, and vibrant. Some brands cause irritation to my scalp due to psoriasis but Vidal Sassoon did not. The only con was the smell was kind of strong. I would highly recommend this brand!!!</li>
    <li> I got to test this out and am very impressed with the coverage.  Was a little intimidated at first having to use the brush and bowl but it proved pretty easy.  I had a lot of gray and it is gone.  Definitely would use this again and recommend to others</li>
    <li> When I kindly received Vidal Sassoon Salonist courtesy of Bzzagent to test the product, I was very excited, and equally nervous as soon as I&lt;br /&gt;realized I needed an extra box since I have really long hair, I went to various different stores with the intention of buying an extra one, but&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same shade, so I went online and checked their very informative videos and decided to take a chance since it says&lt;br /&gt;that if you have thin hair one box would be enough, The presentation of this product is impeccable, the brush that comes with it is of an&lt;br /&gt;excellent quality and reusable, the gloves are great because they are not thin like the ones that come in every other kit, instructions are very easy nice and big, now the two-step procedure by treating the roots first and then lengths can be a little tricky, because it all depends on how different in&lt;br /&gt;color your roots are, I went 2 shades lighter from my dark blonde to a medium blonde and I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in a long time, I had highlights&lt;br /&gt;about a year ago, the procedure is a bit tiring, I have to admit I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for really long hair people to do it all by yourself&lt;br /&gt;because it&#x27;s not that easy, but with a little patience you get the job done, after I did my roots I took the mixture in my hands and worked the&lt;br /&gt;rest of the hair making sure the hair was saturated with product, despite the fact that VS Salonist gives you way more product that the other&lt;br /&gt;companies, it may be a little risky if you have thick hair or a lot of hair, I have long, but very thin and not so much hair and I found it a&lt;br /&gt;bit difficult to stretch the mixture in order to cover my lengths so I was a bit nervous about the results, I guess I emphasized a lot on my&lt;br /&gt;roots, the pleasant scent of the product surprised, since I can&#x27;t stand most hair dyes, simply because the strong smell bothers me so much makes&lt;br /&gt;me sneeze and gives me a headache, VS Salonist didn&#x27;t bother me at all, which made the whole procedure less problematic for me, so that is a huge advantage over the competition, I also liked that serum that comes in this kit, I still needed to see how my hair was going to turn out, I waited&lt;br /&gt;20 minutes for my roots perhaps 22 mins. then another 10 or so minutes for the lengths, then I started praying that my hair wouldn&#x27;t turn some&lt;br /&gt;funky undesirable color, I am not that experienced since I only dyed my hair twice in my life and all I ever do to my hair are highlights, I have&lt;br /&gt;a few grey/silver hairs that camouflage themselves with the rest of my hair, with that thought on my mind  I proceeded to wash my hair, at this&lt;br /&gt;point I was petrified to say the least, it takes me a while to towel dry my hair and detangle, I noticed that my hair felt soft as usual, still&lt;br /&gt;with my hair wet I looked in the mirror and didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic change, but you never know with blonde hair until you dry it, I was only&lt;br /&gt;hoping my hair was not orange at this point, I dried my hair and stood in front of the mirror and I have to say that I started laughing, my hair&lt;br /&gt;looked so nice, like the hair color I had when I was a kid, now I needed to inspect my roots and coverage and the result was surprisingly good,&lt;br /&gt;actually very good, because it came out even, and so shiny and felt so soft, I am quite happy with the results and it is worth taking the time to&lt;br /&gt;do the whole procedure in two steps, I&#x27;d recommend people to get someone to give you a hand since it can be somewhat tiring, but again I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;really dye my hair often at all, so what seems to me as a tiring procedure may be a piece of cake to people with experience.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the two-step process of this hair color kit, which aims to give you an &amp;#34;at-home salon&amp;#34; experience. The mixing powder and tray are a little clumsy for the do-it-yourself-er. I spilled powder all over the counter, but once I got it cleaned up the process reminded me of seeing my stylist mix up the color in the salon. You&#x27;ll use the mixed color for both steps, so be careful not to use too much of it for the roots section of the coloring process. You&#x27;ll also want to plan for a little extra time since you are doing your hair color in two steps. This is not a quickie color process. The brush included in the kit to paint on the color is a great idea. The color turned out as expected from the pictures on the box. Overall, I was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of the two-step process Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent color from Vidal Sassoon. #VidalSassoon #Salonist #Sponsored</li>
    <li> I got a free box to review from Bzzagent #gotitfree #BzzAgent #VidalSassoon and it was the wrong color,so I gave it to a friend and purchased the lightest blonde(after hunting it down for 2 weeks amongst several stores). My only big issue with this is that bowl/brush. I&#x27;m used to the bottle method that&#x27;s easy and simple for me. I splash the developer on my cabinet while mixing and it was so time consuming and annoying that I&#x27;ll never try it again(but that&#x27;s just my own opinion, mainly b/c I have arthritis in my hands that make this harder). The application took me 4x as long as the bottle method(BTW, this kit doesn&#x27;t come with a bottle at all, just the brush/bowl for mixing and application) and I cannot tell if I got all of the roots or not but the formula is burning my scalp a bit. My usual brand does NOT burn at all.</li>
    <li> When i first received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color kit from BzzAgent,i was concerned about the 2 step process,i thought it was going to be so much trouble,but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 step process actually  was so simple and easy to do ,and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;I love how professional my hair looks and how even the color is from root to tip,and its so soft and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to my old brand again.</li>
    <li> I received this for free from Vidal Sassoon and I was excited to try it out. I loved the fact that it was practically fool proof and not messy at all. The instructions were easy to follow and it was easy to apply and the time it took to do everything wasn&#x27;t long at all. I love my new hair color and it looks beautiful; very much salon quality. I received many compliments on it too, which is always nice. I&#x27;m definitely happy with the results and will use this product again because it works great.</li>
    <li> I tried the new Vidal Sasson Salonist Hair Colour in Medium Brown that I got for free to try and give my honest opinion from Bzzagent. The brown color is nice but it came out a little darker than a medium brown. I do like the process of this product...first you apply to your roots and then 10 mins later you apply the remainder that you mix with a serum to your ends. The only problem was I have long hair so there wasn&#x27;t enough product to fully cover my ends. This would be more appropriate for short to shoulder length hair. The color lasted about 7 days before my grays started showing so that was a bit disappointing. I give this product a 3 out of 5 because the pro and cons are side by side.#GotItFree#GotADiscount</li>
    <li> Thanks to a free sample from Vidal Sassoon Salonist color I tried out the light gold brown shade. When I first opened the box I was a little sceptical. The six pieces was a little intimidating, once I got started it was pretty easy. ( I do recommend you have someone check the back for full coverage). I started out brushing the mix on my roots, after waiting the time I did the rest. It took a little bit to rinse out. I love the color, although on me it came out pretty red. Lots of bounce and super soft. The color provides the depth of color of a salon quality color. The color lasted about seven weeks for me and I do wash my hair daily! Good product.</li>
    <li> Love the great coverage and color of this product! It&#x27;s not your typical squirt and go color so it takes some getting used to but the color itself is worth it. I will definitely be using this in the future.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Vidal Sassoon, I was able to product test VS Sassoon Salonist Permanent Color - light gold brown for free.  Black wasn&#x27;t available.  One box isn&#x27;t nearly enough to do my hair so I did a section and let my short-haired daughter have the rest, and it was hardly enough for her.  I appreciated the light scent that they added to dull the bleach smell because I&#x27;m sensitive to chemical smells.  I enjoyed the texture and working with the brush.  The brush gave great control when doing the roots.  My hair felt great when I was finished; however the coverage of grey was not good.  It may have covered 10%.  I was disappointed with the lack of grey coverage but the shade of brown that my black hair turned was nice.  My daughter&#x27;s hair looks very nice.  She previously had black hair with blonde streaks.  Now her hair is brown with golden highlights except where there wasn&#x27;t enough dye coverage (at the back and underneath).  If you have thick short hair, you&#x27;ll need two boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t looking to cover grey then this is great; however, I see that the package says 100% grey coverage and that wasn&#x27;t so for me so I can&#x27;t give it the thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached picture, the left half is the dyed section.</li>
    <li> I got a free trial of this product from Vidal Sassoon and not only did I love the results, I bought color for all my family for Christmas.  They were all so happy I may have just started a new tradition.  It was a really fun excuse to try something new with our looks.  It left my hair feeling great and as a seasoned color user it was a breeze.  When helping my family with theirs I realized that if you have someone helping you it was even easier to use.  I loved that it was not messy.  It gave me a little more control of where I was applying it.  and if you only need to touch up roots it&#x27;s a breeze.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a solid brand.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color to try, so that I could provide feedback.  This product is a great choice for at home hair coloring.  Took me a total of 45 minutes, my husband help with the hard to reach/see areas.  I did not have any problems with the odor, or stinging and staining my skin.  The 2 step process is easy to follow, and mimics what you would get in a Salon, but in a fraction of the time, and at a very affordable price.  Be sure to use a gentle shampoo, recommended for color treated hair, and follow up with the conditioner provided.  The color lasts for weeks and your hair will be shiny soft, with layers of colors and highlights.  Everyone will say, &amp;#34;Oooh, la la!</li>
    <li> Great coverage and beautiful color but make sure you read the directions VERY carefully! This is not your normal at home coloring box. But i loved it. I really like the brush thats included to get it on ur roots!</li>
    <li> LOVED, LOVED, LOVED The AMAZING coverage I got with Light Cool Brown.  I have very thick, coarse, gray hair and it is GONE !!!!!!  Not so thrilled about the 2 step process....If I am in a hurry and I usually am I just wanna dye my hair....not play salonist !!!  But I did enjoy the fact that there is NO chemical hair dye smell.  That is a huge plus.  I loved this product !!!  Thank you Vidal Sassoon for the opportunity to test your product.</li>
    <li> LOVED this product! I have very thick and long hair so I normally use two packages of other hair color kits. I only however received one (#gotitfree #Bzzagent) and was ready to just do my roots, but to my surprise the product was almost enough to to my whole hair!&lt;br /&gt;Pros to this product:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Guide and steps very clearly explained&lt;br /&gt;High quality black gloves to work with provided&lt;br /&gt;All kit products were very fancy and fun to work with&lt;br /&gt;Results were- AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;After 5 weeks- my hair still looks like I&#x27;ve just colored it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pricey (but hey I&#x27;ve got coupons!) :D</li>
    <li> The two step process was a little time consuming that other hair dyes but i liked the turn out.  I went from a brown to a med blond.  I like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly amazed on how my hair turned out. I never expected my hair to have salon quality color like this, while being done by me at home. It was simple to use and the results were great. My hair looks healthy and has beautiful, shiny tones. My husband doesn&#x27;t care too much for colored hair, but even he complimented me on the color. The 2-step process does take a little longer, but it&#x27;s worth it. I will definitely be using the&lt;br /&gt;Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent again. I received this free from Bzz Agent to try.</li>
    <li> awesome hair color kit!  So easy to use and covers all my gray hair.  Love how my hair felt after, wasn&#x27;t dry and my color hasn&#x27;t faded one bit.  I got this product free from Bzzagent.com to try.</li>
    <li> Very Good and Easy Results! I got this kit from My Buzz Agent and decided to give it a try, I have used L&#x27;oreal for years, so I took out of the kit the mixing tray and the paintbrush and it was so easy to follow the directions, and loved the black gloves! After 30 minutes I had the best color I have had in along time, I picked the Cool Light Brown and got so many compliments it is insane! Thank You Buzzagent for the free kit and trying it, I would of not done this on my own, now I am a fan! ;0)</li>
    <li> I love my new color. It turned out great just like in a saloon. I even got to try this free from buzz agent. They couldn&#x27;t have sent a better product. Although if your hair is very thick or super long like mine is, you will need two kits instead of one ( had to run out and buy a second kit)  But other than that I loved it!</li>
    <li> I talked to my family and friends about this great at home color kit. I shared with them that is easy with the two step process. And there&#x27;re not any scary mishaps or mis colors with this kit. This kit takes out the guess work for you. Just great color results every time. I was one if the lucky ones that was picked by VS Sassoon and I was given a free hair coloring kit to try out for me feed back.  but I will most defiantly buy this product in the future when I will need to collie my hair again in 2 months</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Vidal Sassoon Hair Color kit from Bzz Agent to try and give my honest feedback on. I have been looking for that perfect shade of blonde for sometime now. I have very long hair so I was into this process for a while. I have to say this product was hands down to the best home color I have ever used. Simple instructions to follow. There was no burning what so ever and I usually end up with some degree of redness on my face. Once you mix the dye in the bottle it turns orange so don&#x27;t freak out like I did because it was a scare for nothing.</li>
    <li> I got this free from BzzAgent. I really love this product my hair looks amazing and the 2 step process was really easy. I was able to do it by myself it was awesome because usually i would need someone else to help me but with the 2 steps i was able to do it by myself. I love that there are parts that i can keep for the next time i do my hair or add highlights. i would recommend this product to anyone that asked me.</li>
    <li> Got to try Vidal Sasson Salonist hair color free from bzzagent. When I opened the boxed and read that there was an extra step I was like &amp;#34;oh man&amp;#34; but that extra step ensured that I got all my roots which I believe helps cover up all that gray! I&#x27;m used to leaving on the hair color for at least 20 or so minutes so I was skeptical about the whole 10 min thing and was tempted to leave it on a little longer but was afraid I&#x27;ll damage my hair so told myself I better follow the instructions. And I&#x27;m glad I did because 10 mins is all you need! My hair looks vibrant and soft, now keys see how long the hair color last. .. so far so good! I love the brush, feels like your at the salon but in your own home &amp; of course doing it yourself. I would definitely try this again and in a different color! #GotItFree #VidalSassoon #salonist</li>
    <li> I recently colored my hair with Vidal Sassoon salonist permanent hair color and honestly I liked it. Normally box hair color makes my hair brassy,but this one which was darkest neutral brown was not brassy and the color was beautiful just like my natural hair color.I definitely would try it again!</li>
    <li> I received this through Bzzagent and Vidal sassoon to try out. I was so happy it came with a bowl and brush. I feel like its much easier o apply color this way. The color mixed up great and smelled nice also,not to strong. So i applied color and left on the recommended time, rinsed and dried hair and the color was really nice and shiny.  My only issue was that my grey is very resistant and i still had some shiny grey that it didnt color. I will give it another shot though because i liked everything else about it!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic color! Real depth and variety of color tones make it look so real and natural and you can truly customize the coloring to fit the style you want. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my hair feel soft and the color is great, i will continue to but this product i #gotitfree from #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I screwed up.  I dyed my hair red.  Not auburn.  Not reddish brown.  Not brownish red.  Just red.  I should have known there were going to be problems when the dye globbed out like a blood bank explosion.  After 20 minutes of rinsing (and only achieving mostly clear water) Ifinally decided to just go with it.  Unfortunately Halloween is long gone, and I did not land the lead in the Little Mermaid remake (something about cats screaming when I sang) so I really don&#x27;t need synthetic red hair.    Well actually synthetic red hair would have been acceptable.  You see somehow I ended up with a super special version of ombre.  Neon red on top and brown on the ends. Insane.  And not in an artistic way.  Please see the picture to really get the full effect.    Anywho - Vidal Sassoon sent me a free box of Salonist to try.  I figured \\&quot;hey, how much worse can it get\\&quot;.    I went to town, mixing together step one, applying it with the brush and waiting 20 minutes.  Step two used the rest of the dye and a serum.  I popped that on for ten more minutes, then washed and conditioned.    This one little box and 40ish minutes saved me from public ridicule.  Children will not be running to their mother&#x27;s skirts while sobbing.  I am giving away the scarfs I purchased to hide the horror. My wildest dreams have been realized - I have brown hair.  Not just brown but soft, silky, singled color brown hair.  I have begun writing a ditty to express my joy and thankfulness.  Also I managed to avoid spending $$$ at the salon (which would inevitably also involve a scolding from the stylist).    Other than the cheap brush (which is still much better than what other brands offer) I love this product.  I will use it again.  Most liekly the next time I decide to go red.    Disclosure: I was given this product for free my Vudal Sassoon to try and review</li>
    <li> I have been gray since I was a teen.  The gray has always been hard to cover and it does not matter if it is done at home or in the saloon.  Just before the start of the holidays Vidal Sassoon sent me a gift of this kit.  I decided to use this it to look great for the holiday.  This product did take longer to do as there were additional steps and the steps took longer, but the result was worth the effort.  The steps to cover are like they are done in the saloon and included the step of placing coloring on the ends toward the end.Vidal Sassoon worked to cover the gray and the color lasted.  Overall this is a great alternative to the saloon, just be ready for it to take a little longer.</li>
    <li> I got the 6/1 Light Cool Brown shade.  The 2-step process didn&#x27;t seem much different to me than the regular coloring process.  After mixing the two ingredients, which wasn&#x27;t so easy because the cream would hardly come out of the tube and the tube then split.  The mixture took a little longer to mix because it looked lumpy, but after I got that worked out, I applied the color to my hair using the method stated on package and the brush included.  The brush worked really well and had a pointed end to make separating hair easier.  I then left the color on for 30 minutes and then added the serum and spread through all of the hair as stated again on package.  Left that on for 10 minutes and then rinsed and shampooed using a color protecting shampoo and the conditioner included with kit, which smells great.  There was not a nasty chemical smell and the whole process was easy, other than the episode with the tube.  I came out with all of my grays COMPLETELY covered, which is rare for me now, and a nice, rich color that seems to be holding up pretty good.  I would definitely use this again.  I was provided a sample to facilitate my review from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> I got this product through Vidal Sassoon to try, and it is awesome, the color was great that I had on..The only thing that was wrong was that I have really long hair and one box just didn&#x27;t cover all of my head. I think that they should add the number of boxes you would need if doing longer hair,so I had to go get two boxes of the cheaper stuff to cover hail the color on my hair from using Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color. But other then that it was perfect coloring,rich and bold. I really like Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color and will be buying it to do my hair in the future, Great product,full of color</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone! I received it through bzzagent.com and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I received the blonde product and it really shines throughout my hair.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely impressed with this product!  My hair is naturally dark brown, and I chose to lighten it up a bit using Salonist in &amp;#34;Light Cool Brown.&amp;#34;  Usually if I try to lighten my hair with a home boxed coloring it tends to always have an orange tint to it.  After using this product I was thrilled with how natural it looked, no orange at all!  The process is a little more work than your average boxed color, but it&#x27;s totally worth the extra effort to save the amount of money it costs to go to the salon.  It treats roots and lengths separately so its a two-step process that takes a bit longer.  I am very happy with this product and would definitely purchase it again!  It left my hair looking and feeling wonderful!  I received this product compliments of Vidal Sassoon for testing purposes...all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really love this hair dye!! It took my hair from bright red to brown with only 1 box. It was easy to use and I found it left my hair feel really good unlike most box dyes!</li>
    <li> I have only colored my hair once in my lifetime and i found this to be very easy to do myself without having to go to the salon and get it done which can be very costly and i was surprised that it actually matched my natural hair color perfectly, unlike other boxed hair color where it&#x27;s either lighter or darker than it says on the box. It also lasts a lot longer and covers the grey more than the other brands which is great. I have told my friends and coworkers and gave them a coupon to try it since i have received the sample through bzzagent.  I will be buying this again without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! I received a free kit from bzzagent and tried out the salonist kit for the first time. The process was super easy, apply to roots, wait 30 minutes, apply to lengths, wait ten minutes, wash, then condition. Easy to do with step by step instructions. the color is salon quality and looks great! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really am happy with the results from Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color.  There&#x27;s an extra step using this hair color, but the results are great.  The kit comes complete with hair color, conditioner, serum, gloves and detailed, easy to follow directions.  I like the brush that also comes in the kit, it&#x27;s like painting the hair color on and ensures covering all your hair.  After applying 3/4 of the hair color and waiting 20 minutes, you mix the remaining 1/4 hair color with serum and apply to hair.  This stays on for 10 minutes, then rinse.  I was left with shiny hair and no greys.  My hair looks great, and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments in 2 days then in the last year.  I am lucky to have received this product free from Vidal Sassoon, or I may have never tried it. Great hair color.</li>
    <li> So Smooth and Rich in Color so far the Longest Lasting Hair Color I have Tried to Date, a Little more expensive then the other Brands and I wasn&#x27;t able to pile up my hair and do other things while I waited for it to set because it was a little Runny , But It was well worth it,, LOVE LOVE This new VS Product I am definitely making the Switch.</li>
    <li> I am a member of bzzagent.. I #gotitfree from #VidalSassoon #Salonist and was asked to give my opinion of the new 2 step process. Being a hairstylist I am extremely impressed with the out come of the color! I transformed my daughters previous highlighted sunbleached hair and used Medium Gold Brown 5/3...I loved the scent and texture of the product. The 2 step process may intimidate some and you may need someone to help..but I found her hair came out to the color we wanted to achieve and felt so amazing I feel because of the 2 steps..I will be buying this product for sure and trying it out on my own hair very soon!</li>
    <li> Awesome hair color I could not believe how easy it was to apply and the color was amazing just the right color I wanted. The smell of the product was pleasant unlike some that are to harsh smelling. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone. #VidalSassoon #IGotItFree #Sponsored</li>
    <li> So I started out totally liking the new way that I would be coloring my hair! The box was shiny and classy.&lt;br /&gt;I chose a lighter color since I was tired of my normal, boring brown color.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall, my roots turned out several shades lighter than the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it looks like my normal hair and is shiny and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try this again in a darker color.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product! The 2 step process makes you feel as if you are getting a quality salon hair color. Your hair feels soft and manageable after coloring and looks great. There are many different color choices to choose from, so no problem finding your hair color. This is the product I will use from here on out.</li>
    <li> I received this hair color as a BzzAgent promotion, and have to say that I really like it.  The color is bright, covers my &amp;#34;arctic blonde&amp;#34; roots very well, and after a couple weeks my hair is still shiny and bright.</li>
    <li> I received a free box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent in Light Natural Brown. Fantastic product. I had been blonde for years and finally went back to my brown hair. I absolutely love this hair dye. Best dye out there! Easy to use without paying the cost of expensive salon coloring! I feel so pretty! This smells great and I will continue to buy. The dye lasts after several washing as well. Makes my hair shiny as well. THANKS so much Vidal Sassoon for my FREE box of hair dye. I love the new me!</li>
    <li> I got my hair color from Vidal Sassoon with the Vidal Sassoon Salonist color (lightest neutral blonde) last week to test and applied it this weekend.  The kit comes with gloves, plastic mixing bowl and cover, application brush, the colorant, a serum that is added to the colorant in the second application, a color preserving conditioner that should last for up to 5 washings and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been coloring my hair for over a decade…started out just wanting a lighter shade and now I use it to cover grays.  I recently switched to a hair color product that is ammonia free, so this is one of the things that I didn’t like about this product.  It had an offensive smell to me and it stung my scalp a bit upon application to the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the instructions were well laid out with real model photos of the process.  It was easy to understand the two step process, which was new to me, having used other hair colors that required only one step.  The time to wait with the colorant on your hair was a little longer than I’m used to, but still within reason - about 45 minutes for this lighter color.  That is because there are two steps:  root application and then a serum application to the lengths of your hair.  For the root application you are supposed to use the brush, which if you are doing the coloring yourself, I found a bit challenging…especially for the back of your head.  I like to use a bottle and my fingers typically for that step.  BUT, that is probably because I have long, curly hair and the brush just ended up getting tangled in my hair.  For shorter, straight hair the brush is probably very helpful for getting at the roots and for helping to separate the hair into sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second step serum application was easier for me because I only needed to scoop the mix into my hand and apply with my fingers down the length of my hair.  As I said, I have long, curly hair and I could have used a little more color to get a deeper application.  If I use this in the future, I’ll probably use 1 1/2 boxes for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing, shampooing and conditioning (with the color preserving conditioner provided), I let my hair air dry.  The product did a great job coloring my roots and my grays, but the color itself turned out a little more “bronzy” than I expected.  This will surely calm down after a few washings.  I’ve posted a before coloring picture and will follow up with the after coloring photo once I’ve washed my hair a few more times to let the color settle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! I am not really used to dying my own hair so I was a bit sceptical at first, especially with a two-step process. But honestly, it was event easier than the one I usually use in a tube. It was very easy to follow the steps because they are so well described. My hair not only looked great but also felt smooth and smelled amazing (which I can&#x27;t say for the products I usually use). I am only going to use Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Permanent Hair Color from now on :)</li>
    <li> I am NOT a fan of VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR. A few weeks ago, I received a free sample from #VidalSassoon and was so excited to try it. Fast forward to the very difficult application and I was very surprised and disappointed with the Vidal Sassoon brand.    I had a Ladies Hair Day Party at my house with a few family members to sample and review Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color. I am so glad I had other people with me because I could never have done the coloring by myself! You have to apply the color with the roots being first and color your the ends from the front of your head to the back of your head... ugh...all with a tiny salon brush. Then,  there is the 20-30 minute ait between steps..  I tore my gloves trying to get them back on for step 2. FINALLY, I was done and NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED, my color looked streaked and spotty.. but NOT in a good way. My friends were horrifed for me and said they would not be trying this new VS product. #VidalSassoon, #Salonist, #Sponsored #Gotitfree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I received a free box of this hair color from Vidal Sassoon, and although it wasn&#x27;t difficult to use, it was a bit time consuming.  You had to mix it in the little bowl and use a brush to put it on your hair.  The two step process just takes too long in my opinion.  The color turned out good, although I have yet to find any product that lasts more than three weeks.    The color I had was Dark Brown, not Blonde, like it is showing when I submitted my review.</li>
    <li> Vidal sent me this product to try out. At first it seemed like it was going to be a pain as I don&#x27;t do that well seperating my hair the way they say to do. It wasn&#x27;t all that bad since the dye is thick and I was able to massage it in to get to all my roots. It was a pain stirring for a long time to get the mixture smooth. My color turned out pretty brassy and did not go away with shampooing the way other dyes have done in the past. I like the multiple tones of color and I will try a different shade next time to see if I can get a less brassy result. I do like that this lets you leave coloring on your roots longer than on the ends since my ends are always lighter than the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> Surprised at how it covered my grays and giving me a consistent brown color.  My hair felt healthy afterwards.  The gloves were a nice &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; while putting on the product.  The smell was not strong.  My hair felt shinier too at the end.  Will try a lighter color brown next time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a buzz agent, and received a box of color from Vidal Sassoon to try and give my honest opinions on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair about 12-13 yrs now! I live reds and red browns, and that is the reason u originally started coloring my brownish hair. The last few years the grays have been the reason:(&lt;br /&gt;Starting at the beginning.... The kit came with a tray, brush and 3 bottles. Lotta work! Lotta steps! I have 6 house dogs and a husband, and the 10 minutes it took to mix it up, and 8 it took to apply, was entirely to much for me! Not to mention, the last part of the application I had to apply with my hand, and it was so messy!&lt;br /&gt;Next the results! Such bright, vivid colors!! I&#x27;m in love with the shine, and vibrancy, and it covered my grays completely! Absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This would be such a perfect product if it was easier to get ready and apply!&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;ll defiantly use it again, it will just be on occasions that I have the extra time, and maybe a helping hand!</li>
    <li> this product is so easy to use that I don&#x27;t think that I will ever go back to a salon to have my hair colored again.  The color sample on the box is very close to the color that your hair will turn out. not many of the box colors that you can buy match that closely.  I love the color and how it went on and blended and the gray coverage was awesome I did this about a week ago and have washed my hair about 3 times since and the color has not even washed out its still there and that to me is a big thing there are so many that wash out and are a waste of time but this is not  so if you are looking for a new look I highly recommend using the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color I am one that is very leary on using a store bought hair color but was very excited to receive this product free and to give it a try and with the results I got will use it again thank you Vidal Sassoon for allowing me to try it</li>
    <li> I received this product free of charge for review from Vidal Sassoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to go to salons for coloring but I decided to give this a go as, like many others, we&#x27;re working to save money this year. I chose the neutral black shade to take my medium brown hair color closer to my natural shade and to cover up a few stray grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed when unboxing the product that were a lot more odds and ends to use and was a little intimidated by it. Mixing the products in the tray was rather time consuming and it took a while to get a smooth lump-free consistency. Once it was done I used the brush to apply to my roots and waited the 20 minutes. At this point you remove the provided gloves and then must put them back on after the waiting period. I see some people had an issue with this but I just washed them, while wearing them, with soap and water before removal. Then dried them on a hand towel. They were dry and easy to put back on after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then mixed in the serum and applied the rest of the product to my lengths. It says to use your hands but I brushed on first and then rubbed in with my hands. At this point you wait 10 minutes and then rinse, shampoo, and use the provided conditioner. The conditioner had a great scent and my hair felt great after washing. I let it air dry for a bit and then used my blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE my results. My hair is soft and shiny and the color is actually very natural looking. The most amazing part is the shine and the condition of my hair. I applied my color before a New Year&#x27;s Eve party and got several compliments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to hair coloring product. I found it to be worth the extra steps and while it was more work to apply, I feel the results speak for themselves!</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon has done it right! This product was incredible easy to use and makes you really feel like you can get salon quality color in the comfort of your own home! They provide you with all the necessary tools to achieve a great, even color! I will definitely use this every time! Having the brush to be able to get your roots is an essential part of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jessica Ruiz</li>
    <li> Mixed emotions on this but overall a great in home do it yourself coloring system . I have thick hair and one box will be enough no worries . Nice even coloring . Quick and not messy coloring doesn&#x27;t stain your hairline ur your bathroom floor .</li>
    <li> I have received Vidal Sassoon Color from Vidal Sassoon to try out and I must say that I was pleasently surprised with this product. I usually alternate between at home permanent color and salon color depending on time and money. This product could definitely cut out my salon colours because it gives you the control and ease of a salon but it costs a lot less. The color was beautiful and shiny. My hair didn&#x27;t feel brittle like it does with other at home colours. I definitely will be using this product again! Can&#x27;t wait to try out some of their other colours.</li>
    <li> I have about 30% gray coming in and I regularly color my hair.  In the past I have bought different brands that were on sale, but was never impressed.  I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color from the company to try and I have to admit I really love it.  To find a great store bought, but yet professional like, home color is fantastic and in my price range since I color about every 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT HAIR COLOR sent me their product for free to try. I was excited when I received it. The two step is easy and the smell is not strong at all. I had alot of grays and it covered it well. I was very pleased with the results. The conditioner is also great smelling too. Coconutty. LOL. I had my grand daughter who is 15 do my hair and she did a great job. The instructions were easy. I recommend it. A++++</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of this product from bzzagent and I was very excited to use it as I was recently pregnant and didn&#x27;t want to dye  my hair so i had a lot of grey hair to cover.  This product worked amazingly!  It covered all my greys and made my hair soft and shiny!  I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on my hair!  I would recommend this to friends and family for sure!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually color my hair at home but I received a free kit to try at home so I tried it. Very glad I did. Color is great and hair feels so soft!!</li>
    <li> I loved the results but the application was a bit painful and time consuming.  The process took a while but honestly my hair hasn&#x27;t looked better in years.  I normally go to the salon to get my hair colored and this time I chose to do it myself and overall am pleased and will be doing it again. Thank you to Vidal Sassoon for giving me the opportunity to try this outstanding product.  There is a detailed process you must follow but it is worth it so if you want great results follow the directions and you too will be extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> this has been the best hair dye I have ever used on my hair. cannot complain about it one bit. so glad I was able to try out this product from vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and having colored my own hair for the last 3 or 4 years now, was a little skeptical at trying a haircolor that I did not pick out myself. The smell of the color is also a big factor for me, as I usually buy the ammonia-free color to minimize the odor.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised - the color came with a brush, and a bowl, and was super easy to use. Having colored my hair a few months back, I was worried about how the color would come out. It was very even, not at all red (I hate color with red undertones) and has not faded. Most brown color comes out WAY too dark in the beginning, and after about 2 weeks, you get the true color for a couple of weeks before the greys come back, and you have to start over again. Vidal&#x27;s color has been consistent for two weeks now, and has not faded. You will get your true color for the full 4-6 weeks until it is time to re-color. And the smell went away right after washing - and wasnt too strong during the coloring process.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you give it a try - worth taking a chance on.</li>
    <li> I got this product from the manufacturer and really like that it came with everything for the salon experience at home. It has a brush and tray to help make root application easier, which most hair coloring kits don&#x27;t come with. I got great results and feel my roots blend well with my previously processed hair. It left my hair feeling and looking healthier. It delivers quality results</li>
    <li> I received a box of this product for free from Vidal Sassoon via BzzAgent. Upon using Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent color...I am loving the results!  Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent color has made my hair feeling fabulous! It was great and was so easy to use.  The gloves, brush and bowl that are included are great additions to the coloring kit.  They are a vital part of helping to get every strand of hair... from root to tip expertly colored! The directions are also easy to follow. The bottle left no drips. Thanks Vidal Sassoon for this exceptional, affordable at-home use product!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out this new hair color, but wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.  It didn&#x27;t cover my gray roots very well.  5 weeks later, the rest of my hair is really faded out.  This might be perfect for someone without resistant gray hair.  The other negative is how you apply it.  (With the enclosed brush and tray)  I found it difficult...  especially the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I received this item via BuzzAgent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for the Vidal Sasson Salonist  hair coloring kit. They are known for their quality. Everyone remembers the if you don&#x27;t look good we don&#x27;t look good campgain? First let me say I followed the instructions to the letter and I was dubious it would cover my whole head. This was unlike most at home dyes. You actually mix it up in a provider bowl and use a paint brush also included to apply 3/4 of mixture to your roots. You wait 20 minutes the add in a serum to mixture and spread it along to the rest of your hair. Wait 10 minutes rinse out, colors age shampoo and then the provided conditioner. My hair feels wonderful. It is soft and silky as they claim. But my problem comes in because it did what I hoped it wouldn&#x27;t and it is drastically different on my roots. I have been dying my own hair for over 20 years and that has only happened when I try to go lighter, in this case it was darker. The rest of my hair looks nice and this dye would be perfect for someone who had hair all one color root to tip. The application though different than you are used to, does work and will cover all your hair provided it isn&#x27;t half way down your back. It leaves it nice soft and conditioned. I can only share one photo so here is the after picture looking down on my head</li>
    <li> It was a neat concept but I felt like the colorant didn&#x27;t cover up the grays like I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> A new way to colour hair at home. I&#x27;ve been colouring my own hair at home for many years but I also go to the salon to get it done on occasion. I mostly colour to cover a patch of white hairs and to enhance my natural colour but as simple as that seems I have had issues with the lenghts of my hair being darker than my roots. I&#x27;ve tried different application techniques and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference as I am always using dark brown dye. I&#x27;ve tried different brands and I end up with the same results unless I go to the salon... until now.  BzzAgent gave me Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour to try and I am SO glad! It is just as easy if not easier to use than any traditional home dye ( it comes with an awsome little brush for doing your roots!) but the results are drastically different. Covered my pesky white hairs 100% and my roots and lengths are the same colour without the costly visit to my salon. My hair feels healthier than before and looks great. Shiny and the colour has a lot of depth. I won&#x27;t be going back to the salon for colour anytime soon! HG home hair dye! The main difference from other home hair colours is that before you add the dye to the lengths of your hair you add in this serum, it keeps your hair from absorbing to much dye (which is what causes it to get darker than your freshly dyed roots) and keeps your hair healthy and shiny! I will be purchasing this in the future and would absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> I had the awesome pleasure to try the two step vidal sassoon hair color which is very vibrant and easy too use great shine long lasting color and you can do it at home no more salons!!!thanks vidal sassoon for giving me a chance to try your product.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product from Vidal Sassoon to review.  I used Medium Gold Brown on my natural hair.  I had some reddish ends from a previous ombre colour so this product was put to a real test....will it cover the red? Will the results be natural and even?  My answer is yes indeed!  My hair looks great!  Very silky and shiny, soft and manageable.  I&#x27;m not a very experienced colorist, right at the beginning of my grey coverage journey as I only have a few greys at this point so I found the only drawback to be (and possibly due to my lack of experience) the brush to use on the roots.  I found it slightly difficult and quite time consuming to section the back of my hair myself and brush the roots.  That said, with a friend or as a more experienced home colorist I think that the results would be a 5/5.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the natural look of my hair!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little intimidated by the kit and amounts of steps for do it yourself color, but it turned out way better than I thought. The mixing of the product was easy (although there was more stirring required than stated for effect smoothness), the gloves and mixing dish we not cheap. The super harsh chemical smell I&#x27;m used to from hair dye was also not there, this was an added bonus. The whole process went smoothly, although my fingernails did suffer some purple staining for about 48 hours after getting dye on them during rinsing (so use your gloves then as well). I was mildly impressed just after coloring, however I am more impressed with the color as it sets in, (I still get compliments almost daily on my hair color and it&#x27;s been almost a month). If your willing to do a little extra work this kit is worth it.</li>
    <li> Tried Vidal Sassoon and I was so surprised they results were incredible. I am  giving Vidal Sassoon five stars. A great product!</li>
    <li> I have received this product from Vidal Sassoon for the purpose of my review and any opinions are MY OWN! I am NORMALLY a darker blonde.. I TRIED a darker brown.. BUT when reading the directions you should only try to go 2 shades in either direction (lighter or darker) to achieve the proper color.. so in saying this.. I didn&#x27;t receive the color I wanted :( I have however, bought the correct color and will try again!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I would highly recommend it to anyone coloring their hair for the first time.</li>
    <li> I tried the 6/1 and loved it. Intimidating yes. Easy yes. Two steps and your done with the best color I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Great product,  received as promotion from company.&lt;br /&gt;Did wonderful on my roots.&lt;br /&gt;But I suggest doubling up for very long thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great!!</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing.  It makes old hair colors seem like they are a thing of the past.  It covered my gray so well.  I would definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> Found it difficult to apply alone but the colour was amazing. Really a great quality for an at home dye. Next time I&#x27;ll know to have someone handy to help with 2 step application</li>
    <li> I tried Vidal sassoon hair color and love it.have received lots of great feed back. Some friends even thought I had it professionally done. Comes out so even..love this hair color. Would definitely buy again.it takes a little longer to do, but the end product it so worth it. Love the color feel and smell. Would advise people dying their hair got the first time to use Vidal Sassoon as it turns out very even!!</li>
    <li> #VidalSassoonSalonist, #IGotItFree, #BeingABzzAgent, After Receiving My Hair Color I Sat Down and thought I had gotten myself into a big mess. Boy was I wrong. This two step process was so easy, once I was done and styled my hair I realized how soft and manageable my hair had become. I have Salon Looking Hair without the Salon prices, my roots and ends are all the same color. No new growth color difference, which is Hugh when doing your own coloring. This product can be sent to you front door, all you have to do is get on there Web site and set yourself up. So now you don&#x27;t even have to leave your own home to get that Beautiful Salon Look. My hair is Super Shiney and I&#x27;m not feeling with dried out hair&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised</li>
    <li> Thank you to Vidal Sassoon for giving me the opportunity to try the Salonist permanent hair color in 8.0 I found the instructions to be fairly easy to follow and the color was soo vibrant and lasted that way. I&#x27;m one who always went to the salon to get it done cuz i always thought that if u have it done in a salon it has to be better and boy was i soo wrong about that cuz the color i did all by myself and the color was soo much more vibrant and it doesn&#x27;t fade at all in fact it lasted longer than the salon and im still shocked as to how gorgeous my hair looks and all my friends noticed a change for the better and i told them they need to try the Vidal Salon Salonist permanent hair color for themselves and so far three of my girlfriends did buy it and were ecstatic at the outcome. I&#x27;m soo lucky Vidal Sassoon gave me the opportunity to try it for free and im telling everyone you definetely have to try it i promise u will be not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box I was impressed. The gloves were the best. I know of one other drugstore brand that offers nice fitting gloves. It really makes the difference. I like the two step process too. I got the #4/0 dark natural brown color. I use it to cover about 20 grey strands I have and then to just boost my natural color. This delivered and then some. I loved mixing it in the bowl and using the brush to really control where I was putting the color. It wasn&#x27;t a splat and a spread like using a bottle system. It also felt with the brush I had more control over where the color was going and I was getting each tiny strand permeated with color. I liked that I could achieve the results I wanted on my own time in the comfort of my own home. The price point can&#x27;t be beat. I feel like I am very comfortable coloring my hair at own anyways, but I think even a novice could hand this and have fun to boot. I did receive this from the company at no cost to me and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color is hands down the best at home hair dye that I have used so far.  The convenient bowl and brush are easy to use and make dying your hair much easier and virtually mess free (which is a big deal for me).  Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a product that was designed like a beauty salon.  There are several things that stood out from all the rest. First: it covered ALL my gray and has lasted. Second: The conditioner that comes with the kit is AWESOME, because my hair is softer than it was before I colored it. Usually my hair Is dry after coloring, but not with Vidal Sassoon Hair Permanent Colour!  I am VERY IMPRESSED and will be using this product again. I was able to test this product from Vidal Sassoon for bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I normally have my hair colored at the salon but I gave this a try. I was skeptical at first but loved the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it again and save myself a ton of money.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The product itself is good but when someone tells me &#x27;easy&#x27; I expect it to be very easy.  It was not as easy as I hoped to mix and apply but once I figured it out I would try it again.  I love that they have off colors like violet.</li>
    <li> Im all for coloring my hair at home. So when I got this product free from Vidal Sassoon to try out, I was excited. I opened up the box and inside was instructions, a coloring brush, plastic bowl, black gloves, color cream, developing lotion, serum and the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;You mix the colored cream and lotion together, takes a couple minutes to fully blend. The color I used was medium golden brown and the mixture looked like pumpkin puree in color. Dont get discouraged, your hair wont turn blond.&lt;br /&gt;The mixture was thick, almost paste like, it didn&#x27;t drip or get on my clothes - that right there is something that color that is applied by bottle doesn&#x27;t do. I brushed the mixture on my roots, starting in the front and working my way down each end. It helps to separate your hair into 2 sections. Only use 3/4 of the mixture in the tray, you&#x27;ll see a line in the bowl that will let you know how much to save. After applying to your roots only, wait 20 min.&lt;br /&gt;Then come back and use the remaining 3/4 and add in the serum, mix well and apply to your lengths. It says to use you hand to apply. Again, it didn&#x27;t drip and was able to use all of the product on my hair. My hair is long (past shoulders) and 1 box was enough. Leave on for 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse hair, shampoo and apply the conditioner. So simple and I recommend this product. It covered my grays and my hair looks healthy, shiny and new.</li>
    <li> i am use to using natural hair color but this brand is really nice.. easy to do my self and feels pretty good in my hair.. going on a few weeks now and grey coverage is pretty good. Im pretty happy with this color and Visal Sasoon :-) would recommend</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE WORST AT HOME COLORING SYSTEM EVER. I GOOT IT FREE TO TRY FROM BZZAGENT AND HATED THIS PRODUCT. THERE WERE SO MANY INSTRUCTIONS THAT I HAD TO TAPE THEM TO MY WALL TO READ AS I APPLIED THIS MESSY COLORING FIASCO. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE OF US THAT DO HAVE SHORT CUTS. THEN YOU HAVE TO MIX THIS CONCOCTION, PUT SOME TO THE SIDE FOR LATER AND THEN APPLY THIS GOOP. THEN YOU TAKE THE ONE PR OF GLOVES GIVEN OFF TO GET READY FOR SECOND STEP. SO THEN YOU PUT SAME USEDM AND POSSIBLY TORN GLOVES BACK ON TO PUT REMAINDER OF COLOR IN THE HAIR. THEN, MY LEAST FAVE PART IS TO USE YOUR OWN SHAMPOO TO RINSE OUT THE COLOR, BCUZ NONE IS SUPPLIED TO YOU. THEN ONCE YOU USE ANY RANDOM SHAMPOO, YOU THEN COME BACK TO THE LAST STEP OF THE PROCESS AND USE THE CONDITIONER GIVEN TO END THE TOO LONG, NOT THOUGHT OUT WELL PROCESS.&lt;br /&gt;  NOW TELL ME IF THATS WHAT YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH OR LET YOUR SALONIST DO IT?</li>
    <li> Vidal Sasson BZZ AGENT</li>
    <li> Four stars because this one is messy for me to do alone on my long hair!  Otherwise, all over, EVEN color with the two step process--first time it&#x27;s ever happened for me!!  Will definitely use again! Tried this free through #bzzagent and #vidalsassoonsalonist</li>
    <li> I am with Bzzagent and received this hair color to try. I have been coloring my hair for the past 20 years starting when I was 18. I dye my hair every 3 to 4 months and often change colors. I have used other hair colors products that have dried out my hair and the color only lasting about 4 weeks and looking washed out after a couple of washes. This brand is the best I have used did not dry out my hair it made my hair very soft and silky after using.  I dyed my hair 6 weeks ago,completely covered the few greys I have and it still looks good. I used medium neutral brown which is very close to my natural hair color. I will be using this brand from now on. I did not experience any burning or irritation on my scalp or skin. Plus this color did not dye my skin, it wiped off very easy.</li>
    <li> Love the color...my hair looks like it was professional colored it has high and low lights that look fantastic..simple to do the 2 step process with outstanding results</li>
    <li> Received a free sample kit of this product. I was very pleased on how long the color lasted with the shine. It was simple and easy to use, I loved the fact you used similar products like in the salon. It was the same messiness as all the other ones. I would definitely say it is worth it for as long as it has lasted.</li>
    <li> I received a free one application from P&amp;G - Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color  Medium Gold Brown.I would consider this product to be one of the best I have tried so far for gray coverage and I was very pleased that my hair color didn&#x27;t start to fade about 5 weeks or more after coloring. All other products I have tried start fading within two weeks.I love the coverage of this product. I color just roots, blends well. I&#x27;m kind of a messy applier, so I have to take all the precautions. If you do get stains, use ajax and it will pretty much clean it up.It also smells nice and leaves the hair in good condition.If you have long hair you might consider two boxes.I would buy again Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected it to be. Their wasn&#x27;t enough color to do my hair in one box, if you have thick hair you need at least 2-3 boxes and the color looked so bad when finished, would never use this product again. My hair is blond but has a red tint to it and the color pulled out the red in my hair although my hair is blond naturally.  Other colors have not done this to my hair. The packaging is nice and it has a nice bowel and brush as well as a nice set of resuable gloves.  Just disappointed in the way my hair turned out.</li>
    <li> I tried the Medium Golden Brown shade and loved the scent, the process and the color! I liked how easy it was to apply and how my hair didn&#x27;t look one tone. I thought the color looked better than any other at home color kit I have ever tried. My only complaint is that the color faded faster than other brands. I have to color my roots every 4 weeks and typically the color lasts. I found with this product that the color started to fade after a few weeks. I used the same color safe hair products that I always use, so I don&#x27;t know why it started to fade.</li>
    <li> I received this from Vidal Sassoon to try and I really like this hair color kit but I wish it came with two sets of gloves since it is a two step process. Other then that it was a great match for my hair color and the product worked well. It has been almost a month and still no grey&#x27;s peeking through.</li>
    <li> I love this product.. I feel it has easy steps and everyone can do their own hair and not be afraid to mess it up.. Start with the roots and work your way to the tips.. plain and simple... All the color stays on and well I have had it for a good while washed it over and over its seems to be in such great shape..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Bzzagent and #gotitfree to try out myself at home. The smell is very mild and non bleachy. The coverage over my Lavender was fabulous!!! The only hair color I&#x27;ve found to cover such a bolder color. The only disappointment I have in the product is the price, BUT it&#x27;s well worth it and did the job well</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use and the color is vibrant!  Would definitely use this product again. Thanks VS!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using differing shades of brown for the past year and each one has worked perfectly for me. The conditioner is the best of any brand I used in the past. I love having gloves that actually fit rather than the cheap baggy gloves that come with other brands. I don&#x27;t plan to ever use another brand. Thanks to #vidalsassoon #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I was  sent this product to try and review absolutely free . I wasnt one to try and review . my daycare mommy was desperate  to cover pink underside of her hair because work place  policy said no un natural color allowed ,  only natural colors .she  followed all package directions and it failed to conceal pink . Pink turned  purple. If you want to cover natural or gray it looks like product works great  , but if coloring a hue like pink it doesnt do the job completely. Mom was. Satisfied with it otherwise.</li>
    <li> I received a free product sample from Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent! (Thank you!) I got the Dark Neutral Brown shade that matched my hair color perfectly! I love this hair coloring system. It is a two step process, coloring your roots and ends separately. In my experiences with home coloring, which I have been doing for years now, this has been one of the best ones that I have used. I specifically loved how the color blended perfectly; not leaving any gaps in color on my hair. It produced a wonderful, dark and rich color that left my hair feeling so soft and shiny! I started going grey in my early thirties, so I am geared towards a product that will cover my grey completely. This did just that. I loved the two step process, since my roots are my problem areas. I like that this is a system that salons practice, yet I can do it at home for a fraction of the cost! My hair was so manageable and soft after applying the color. I received so many compliments on how healthy my hair looked and people were so surprised to know that I colored my hair myself with Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Salonist hair color. This will definitely be stocked up at my house, as my hair grows super fast and I will need to color probably more frequently than most. I would highly recommend trying this product and seeing for yourself how wonderfully it blends. Thank you for the product sample Vidal Sassoon; I can&#x27;t wait to use it again to achieve superior results! #sponsored #VidalSassoon #Salonist</li>
    <li> I received a free box of #VidalSassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Color Kit, 4/0 Dark Neutral Brown from #BzzAgent. I have long dark brown hair that I have always dyed at home and end up with different shades on the lengths. This is a premium hair colour that is easy to apply, with no harsh smell. Using the brush &amp; tray then adding the serum to apply to the lengths was not messy and gave full gray coverage. My hair has an even, natural, rich tone, and feels silky soft. Thank you #VidalSassoon for this luxury product.</li>
    <li> I received this from Vidal Sassoon to try; I like it! As a former stylist I was impressed, It was easy to apply, and the tools included were of decent quality. Instructions were easy to follow. Product smelled good, as far as chemicals go. Left my hair in decent shape afterward, as well. When I first rinsed my color out, I was a bit worried, because my fine curly hair felt a bit dry, like it was going to be a disaster when it was dry. That wasn&#x27;t the case, after using the included conditioner, everything was fine. I like that this product differentiates between applying to roots and applying to ends, by instructing you to save some color and adding the other packet before applying. An issue which can cause overprocessing and color loss at ends with home color is people assuming they should color all the hair each time they color. For all its pluses, why only 4 stars? It did not cover my gray, at all. I don&#x27;t have much gray yet, and it is not resistant, but it did not color, even though I applied the color there first. As for longevity, it seems to have lasted pretty well, I haven&#x27;t experienced fading, and my previously colored ends which were blended when I used this color as per instructions are not damaged. I would recommend it to others. Many reviews here state the gray was covered well, so don&#x27;t decide not to try it because of that, I may just be part of a small percentage whose gray it didn&#x27;t cover.</li>
    <li> I received a free box of VS Salonist to try. I was not disappointed, the color came out mult-dimensional, lustrous &amp; covered gray. Only thing I did not like was dividing color in a dinky tray, small portion for roots, larger for rest of hair. You do need an hour to complete process from start to finish. I think it is worth it for salon quality results at home. I did my hair almost a month ago and it still looks terrific! Vidal Sassoon would have approved!</li>
    <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent to review.  I loved Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Salonist Permanent Hair Color.  My first thought when starting the process was that the smell of the product didn&#x27;t bother me.  Some hair dye&#x27;s get to me and give me a headache, this one was great.  Also application was easy!  I was a little nervous since I tend to use foaming dyes but application was really easy to get a hang of.  Almost missed the step though of doing roots first and letting them sit before the rest of my hair!  That was something new to me, thankfully I did a look over of the instructions before getting too far in.  Now the best part of this, the colour!!  I loved how it turned out.  The shade was beautiful and it left my hair looking so healthy and shiny.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it since doing it.  The staying power has been great so far too!  It&#x27;s been a few weeks and it still looks great.  I will definitely use this box again!</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color is really terrific. I really enjoyed the way the kit was packaged. I felt right away that this was a better than average product. The Kit contained a mixing tray, flat paint type brush and black gloves (along with the coloring agents/conditioner). Right away I felt like I was about to do a professional treatment. I followed the directions and am very happy with the color. It has been a few weeks now and the color has held, not fading like many start to do over time. I chose a color close to my natural color and have not needed a touch up yet. I am really happy with my hair color and will continue to use Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair colour at a reasonable price. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a product I received from BzzAgent to try and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;The process is a bit long but it is worth it. It covered my grey hair and it lasts a long time .&lt;br /&gt;Also, there was no strong odor of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Vidal Sasson Hair Salonist to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in 9/0 Light Neutral Blonde. I typically use a brush to apply hair color so the application of one in this kit was a smart move by Vidal Sassoon. I would have preferred the brush have stiffer bristles, but it worked okay. I&#x27;m not sure about the extra step to add the serum in after you apply to the roots (seems unnecessary), but my hair came out soft and silky thanks to the conditioner included in the kit. The conditioner alone makes this a worthwhile purchase--it&#x27;s that good. The color looked nice, my gray covered and my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist was one of the best home coloring kits I have ever used. The results are long lasting covering my hard to dye white hairs. Everything in the kit was a good quality from the black gloves to the mixing tray. The dye was not stinky or messy. It didn&#x27;t drip all over. That&#x27;s why I liked the creamy texture. The two-step process made the coverage more thorough. I will definitely use again! I received for free from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> I tired this new innovative hair color! You feel like you have brought the salon home with you. It has all the salon feel with the bucket and application brush. The consistency of the dye is a great creamy texture that will not run or drop. It gave amazing grey coverage and lasting results.  I am looking forward to purchasing this brand again and again. Thank you to Vidal Sassoon for allowing me to try this product before it even hit the shelves. Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleased to receive the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair color system from the company to give it a try. I usually color my own hair so I was intrigued with having uniform color results throughout. I must say that the the colorful pictures in the guide made the entire process an easy walk through. I loved that the applicator brush was included! I have not seen that before. It is basically a two step process. You need to apply to the new growth first, wait, and then do the rest of the length. It was a very simple process. The results were just as promised. I got the rich medium brown shade with gold tones. Everyone wanted to know where I had my hair done. They couldn&#x27;t believe it was from a box. The key difference here is that the color was absolutely uniform throughout the length of my hair. No lines, no uneven color. Also my hair came out of the process seemingly a lot healthier than on other occasions. This is very important to me. Will be staying with this product!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing! it really works and my hair looks amazing! it lasts so long!</li>
    <li> I love my new look! This was my first time ever I tried VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT COLOR.The product looks so fancy! strong gloves, brush and the rest of the stuff looks like very expensive product! it looks very impressive! I can&#x27;t tell that it was very very easy to apply color on my hair its a little tricky process.It took about 20 min for my long hair.But the result was amazing!!!! I love the color of my hair and it&#x27;s not washing away after 2 weeks! So I will recommend to dive it a try! I received a free box of VIDAL SASSOON SALONIST PERMANENT COLOR from Vidal Sassoon for my honest review.</li>
    <li> So I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color . At first glance it was intimidating , so many items . But once I read the directions and finished the process , it was extremely worth it. Applying it went on easily. Even the smell was not too bad. The best part though was the finished result. Great coverage , especially on those hard to cover grays! In writing this review it has been three weeks since applying the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color , happy to report it still looks great. My gray that has since grown out is of course showing but the coverage has lasted! I would like to point out the conditioner is amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I thought I knew boxed hair dye. The flimsy clear gloves, the horrible smell, the squeeze bottle that claimed to be precise but somehow managed to turn my bathroom counter floors and walls into a canvas for splatter paint art. After a chain of bad experiences, I had vowed to leave my hair colour to the professionals. That is, of course, until I tried Vidal Sassoon’s new Salonist Permanent Hair Color!&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, I was impressed and a little intimidated immediately upon opening the box! The kit comes with a little bowl and brush, just like the pro stylists use at the salon! The gloves were durable and high quality – not like what I was used to with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to mix the colour and apply, I found everything to be clearly labelled and easy to use. I enjoyed feeling like a “pro” when I brushed the colour on my roots. My only concern was that I’d not saturated the roots at the back of my head. I have a lot of hair and I had to consult my husband to check out my work at the back of my head and let me know where I’d missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;What I found when I dried my hair was that the Salonist blended perfectly from my roots to my ends while providing natural looking depth &amp; tones. The end result looked very natural and I loved how shiny my hair looked! I have some gray along my roots, and it did an excellent job of covering that unwanted gray! It also left my hair feeling soft &amp; silky! This is the best at-home hair dye I have ever used and I will definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color in 5/0 Medium Neutral Brown.  I did receive this free from Vidal Sassoon but my review is 100% my opinion only!  I have brown hair so this was a good one for me.  The instructions and the bottles were clear to me.  I don’t think it was difficult at all but I am sure that, if people only skim the directions or bottles, they will find it confusing.  I mixed the first step, dyed my roots and waited the allotted time.  Then I completed the second step of the dyeing with the serum product.  There was definitely enough dye for my head of hair.  I have super thick hair and a LOT of it (as I am always told when I get my hair cut) so they really gave enough product.  The product was thick so it was easy to apply and actually SEE where it was placed on your hair.  It was not so think, like other products, that it absorbs quickly into your hair and you cannot actually tell what hair you have dyed.  It was so thick that I stopped using the brush and just put it on with my gloved fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color was not as potent as other hair colors that I have used.  I actually dyed my hair when on vacation and it did not stink of the room for the remainder of the evening.  When I dye my hair at home, I have to air out the house because it stinks that much!  Now, it DID still smell like hair dye but it wasn’t as strong as other products that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the color, the 5/0 Medium Neutral Brown was the best match to my natural color than any other product that I have tried.  Typically, my hair becomes dry and brittle after dyeing and gets much worse as the weeks go by.  Not the case with this product.  So far, my hair is in the best condition of any home permanent coloring.  It was soft and is still moisturized and I have continued to use the conditioner weekly too.  I am now over a month out from dyeing and my stubborn grays are starting to come back so the longevity of the dye is no more than any other box home color.  The color was not brassy in any way and still isn’t weeks later.  Overall the color was excellent and my hair is in good shape post dye.  Now if only my grays would stay dyed as long as the rest of my hair does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get my hair dyed in less than an hour.  It was great to have it done for a fracture of the cost and time that it takes to go to the salon AND my hair feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> Great product....easy mixing....creamy...full coverage</li>
    <li> I typically go to get my hair color treated at a Hair Salon but the cost is crazy!  VS Sassoon sent me one of their newest home coloring kits, VS Sassoon Salonist.  I had used previous hair coloring treatments in the past but they all either smelled really bad or the color faded quickly.  I chose the Light Gold Brown (6/3) color to lighten my already dark brown lockes.  The directions looked simple and easy to follow.  I was originally going to attempt this by myself but my loving husband helped me.  And I am glad he did!  My hair is very wavy and he had issues with coating my hair with the product.  It took him a while to work the product through my hair. The product didn&#x27;t take long to set. The conditioner smelled awesome! I got great quality color in less time and for less money than a salon!  So overall, I loved the results of this product!  The color turned out great!</li>
    <li> i have to say at first i wasn&#x27;t sure if i was going to be able to do this by myself... but after i opened the box and read the instructions it wasn&#x27;t so bad or hard.. it actually was pretty easy once i got it going... only thing is i left my hair dirty while coloring i did not wash my hair first... I&#x27;ve heard it best to dye hair while dirty for the natural oils our hair has helps the color sink in..I choose black hair color for one to cover my grays and to get rid of the blond colors in my hair. The product it self did not burn in my hair nor was the smell over bearing. everything was easy to use esp the applicator, once done the color came out great and my hair was super soft.. my mom and hubby thought i went to the salon lol... I did receive this product for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I&#x27;m have natural red hair and it is so hard to completely cover red for some reason. Also with red hair comes not grey but white hair. So I was excited to try the Vidal Sassoon products to see how well they work 9 my hair. I went darker than my natural hair color and once I was finished dying my hair I saw on white so I was really impressed with the product!! I will completely recommend to family and friends!!</li>
    <li> Upon opening the package I was happy to see all the accessories they included. Not very many hair colouring brands give you all of this. I did the two step process as it requires, and was slightly uncomfortable with it at first but the results were worth it. I didn&#x27;t have the least bit of a problem using it over the previous brand I used. The coloring is rich and it makes my hair feel shiny. I think the price is slightly more than I&#x27;m used to paying so I will be on the lookout for sales. And it is hard to find where I live so will have to find it online when possible again. Overall I was happy with the results of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color.</li>
    <li> I have been a Bzzagent for almost a year now and recently was invited to try the New Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color.When I received my Salonist Hair Color  I (chose the Neutral Black btw)was pleasantly surprised with what it contained. Vidal Sassoon had thought of everything, including a nice little dish with cover I might add. It also included a brush which is something I&#x27;m always looking for it, seems like mine always gets misplaced. Well no more worries about that anymore, you get a new one each time. I also thought these gloves were of much better quality as opposed to others previously purchased. I must admit the direction seemed a lot more in depth with additional steps other colors did not require. I made sure I read them several times to ensure proper &amp; complete coverage. The fact that Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color did not require the use of a squeeze bottle in its application process was different for a home hair color kit. This process was more of a Salon type the advantage was one could do it at home and save money. Sounded great considering what a Salon color costs. Well I started the color process as per instructions and found it really wasn&#x27;t that bad. Applying the color on roots as directed wasn&#x27;t that bad. Here I thought this would be a messy process, compared to the bottle which we as women have used for years. The color had a nice consistency no running down my face as I had feared. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by the smell or should I say lack of that awful smell. Yes, it took a little longer but the end result was well worth it. After rinsing my hair which I must say rinsed out much easier then expected. The clean up was not bad at all either especially since it was Neutral Black. Again, I cannot stress this enough follow all steps in the direction, those extra minutes really do make a difference in my opinion. I found the coverage to be much better as opposed to other home colors. We&#x27;ve all dyed our hair and thecolor look awesome on the box, or even on a strand test, then we rinse it and it&#x27;s not at all like expected. Well not with this New Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color, it&#x27;s exactly as shown or described on box. I loved the fact that when I rinsed my hair it looked absolutely amazing. This is something I&#x27;ve never experienced. I usually stand and look in the mirror probably like most women do, and tell myself &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll get used to it after awhile&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s never like it looks on box or color strands. Once I dried my hair, I could see just how awesome the color looked. I had a bold color, which was multifaceted and best of all left my hair smooth and silky. Okay, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve probably heard this before or experienced how good your hair feels after you first dye it. However, that usually never last past the first two shampoos. It&#x27;s been almost a month now, my hair still feels and looks amazing. Actually even better then the first day. I am so impressed with how well this color is holding up, but also how great  it covered the gray hair. None of those funky smells that tend to stick to your hair long after you&#x27;ve dyed it. I also got my daughter is using the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color instead of her usual brand . And she absolutely loves it, and cannot say enough good things about it. She&#x27;s a singer that lives and performs in Nashville. And in her business  looking your best is very important, between the performances, pictures, stage lights, humidity, cigarette smoke and what have you, this color definitely stands up. She is so impressed just as I was, about how great the color held up after weeks. In her case, she probably washes her hair more then most people do. And the fact she can save money by getting a Salon color at home is terrific. This is a win win for not only myself and daughter but all women out there. It&#x27;s great to have the ability to change your look, which in turn changes how you feel about yourself. And for substantially less then going to a Salon. I must say Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color in my opinion, is the best. I believe eventually the rest of the hair color companies will  have to make changes in order to compete. #VidalSassoon is ahead of the game with this product. Would definitely recommend it as I have been and will continue to do so. Thanks for making me feel at least ten years younger Vidal Sassoon, I really needed this. Like I said in the beginning of this review, what a great way to start your new year with a great new look. Check out Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color you won&#x27;t be sorry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; #Sponsored  #VidalSassoon #BoldBeautifulColors #Salonist  #ExcellentCoverage #SayGoodbyeToGrayHair</li>
    <li> I honestly thought it was all hype until Vidal Sassoon sent me the product to try for free. I was surprised to find out how easy it was to use the 2 step system, it really does work as it claims. First it&#x27; works on the roots, then the length of the hair, and what&#x27;s even better, NO SMELL!! NO STINGING! The two things I hate the most when coloring my hair. The results are amazing, this is a product vi will repurchase. I highly recommend it, it works fabulous!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this color on for a month now without any sign of fading. I went from an ultra light blonde to a dark brown. Usually with that range, at home colors make it look faded. I feel like I&#x27;ve had professional color put on my hair. I would buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product to try and review as a BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Everyone who colors hair at home should try this product!</li>
    <li> I tried the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color in light golden brown and really liked the color. I had dyed my hair a very bright red color that I loved when it was fresh, but was really starting to dislike as it faded out very unevenly and looked a little brassy . I was looking to even the tones in my hair back out without it looking flat. I really liked the color of this; I felt like it evened out the problems I was left with from the last dye I used, but I feel like I can still see highlights and lowlights in my new color. the technique / application instructions have a lot more steps then anything else I have used in recent times. and im not sure I would do this exact product again, when I can achieve a similar color with a lot less work.  I did get this product free from the manufacturer to try, but the opinions are all mine!!!</li>
    <li> I think that the fact that it has no ammonia smell is awesome, I love the color and yes it does have a salon quality. My only gripe about the product is you need help, it is a very difficult process to do alone. But if you have someone to help you I highly recommend this product over those on the market. It is salon quality without salon price.</li>
    <li> Become a Salonist and get your flawless colour and shine with perfection! Tried it the first weekend when it first came to my door, and its been months, and the colour protection is remarkable.</li>
    <li> I recieved this hair coloring kit from vidal sassoon as a try it before anyone can buy it and once I recieved it I was excited to give it a try. When I opened it I noticed it was very much looked like how a professional would do your hair at a salon. Very easy read instructions and the results were fantastic! Very viberant color and I have had so many complaments my hair. Thank you vidal sassoon . I will defenitly buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I recently got the chance to try this product for Free thanks to Bzzagent.  The 2 step process provided great even color.  The extra step made my hair look great not \\&quot;box dyed\\&quot;.  I will definately use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon sent me a free trial of their Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color!!!! WOW - how great the color and how nice my hair felt after - no dryness or stiffness!!! I loved it - - the color is vibrant and rich - my hair looks fabulous and I am very happy with this - what gals need to know is that this product is wonderful - yes, it is a little more detailed to apply but it works great and is very, very worth the little bit of extra time to apply!!! TRY it - you will fall in love!!! Yes, this will be my go to Colour from now on!!! There are many great shades to choose from!  ENJOY</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from Bzzagent for free. So when I my Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour package I tried it right away. I was skeptical at first, because i have tried other hair  coloring and  didnt get a  good result. But to my  surprise, I am happy and proud to let my  hair out. The compliments  on my hair is  amazon. I have truely  found my permanent hair colouring.</li>
    <li> Loved how vidal sassoon color covered my grey hair and that it was sk easy to use just fwo steps and i was done the best parts where that there werent any harsh smells and no drips...thanks to vidal sassoon i got to try it out for free thank you so much luv it</li>
    <li> I really like the natural color this product gave me. While it was kind of hard for me to do the roots first (my hair is halfway down my back) I know if my hair was shorter it would have been much easier to apply. I really like the compliments that I have received on the color and shine this product gave me. It was kind of a hassle to mix in the bowl and really a hassle to keep some of it to put on in step 2. I guess it as worth it in the end. Its been 3 weeks since I colored and it still looks great!</li>
    <li> I finally was able to try the new color from Vidal Sassoon, that I received as a sample from Vidal Sassoon through Bzzagent to try out.  All I can say is amazing!  Not only did it color all of my grey(ok white) hair, it made them look like highlights.  It was so easy to use ( although I did have help in the form of my husband).  I like how the 2 step process worked and I thought that both the gloves in the kit and the color brush were far superior to any other at home hair color I have used in the past.  And the greatest thing of all is the fact that it did not leave a nasty \\&quot;coloring\\&quot; scent while being used or even after the hair color was removed. My hair just smells freshly washed.  I will definitely be using this product again in the future!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It gave me long lasting color, soft and manageable hair, and lots of compliments. It was easy to use once I got the hang of it. It is a bit time consuming, but it&#x27;s worthiy in the end. I was able to try this for free through BzzAgent, but it will be my FIRST choice from now on!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair color!</li>
    <li> The color has lasted with aid of specialized shampoos to keep brassiness at bay.  It was a little more complicated to apply than your average box of color.  It hasn&#x27;t damaged the hair strands too much.  A little pricey vs. standard color applications.</li>
    <li> I received Vidal Sassoon through my campaign for free to try and give my opinion. I was skeptical first when I was reading that coloring your hair involves a two step process but I must say I love the result. The color came out perfect. The process is easy, take the same time like other color products just follow the instruction, everything you need is included in the box (mixing bowl, cloves). For me personally.....I like the product, will use it again and recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I received this kit through BZZAgent and I was glad I did. It was one of the best free gift&#x27;s I have received yet. It was easy to apply and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair three different colors like regular hair dye normally does. This was a professional style dye that you can apply at home.</li>
    <li> I received this from the company to try and review. When it arrived, I was skeptical at first because of the 2 step process, thinking it would be too time consuming. I am so glad I decided to go ahead with it anyway! It was easier and quicker than I expected and the outcome completely surpassed my expectations! The color is consistent throughout, the color is exactly as the box showed the results would be and extremely vibrant and it also gave me full-coverage over the various strands of gray in my hair. I will continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available! I am also looking forward to trying more of Vidal Sassoon products since this one was a 5 star experience!</li>
    <li> I love this new haircolor system. I know it took two separate steps but the results were definitely worth it. Over a week after using it I still have vibrant refreshed color throughout my whole head of hair! Vidal Sassoon Colorist Hair Colour Permanent is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I am a #Bzzagent and received this from Vidal Sassoon to try for free for my thoughts. I colored my hair yesterday and am very pleased. This product is very easy to use. It is thick and not runny like some colors so it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere. It is easy to wash off skin when you do your hairline. It covered my grays very well and gave great dimension of color, not just one shade. It made my normally frizzy dry hair soft, shiny and smooth. I would definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this product because I recieved it thru bzzagent to try for free! I was excited to try it because the process is something different like the same process they do in salons. I&#x27;m like 50/50 on this process I think I like the process of other hair color better it&#x27;s much more faster and easier. I have to admit though that this process it makes your hair color stand out more and it&#x27;s more vibrant!</li>
    <li> To be honest I was scared at first when I read there was a two step process because I thought the dying process would take a lot longer then normal. But to my surprise it didn&#x27;t and I was very happy with my results. I have long but thin hair and i did need to boxes for full coverage.</li>
    <li> Another great score (sample) from Vidal Sassoon who gave me a free sample to try and review!  Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color has a new easy 2 step system with all the tools and salon tricks for coloring your hair at home in your very own salon.  I watched the video first which made it pretty simple when it came time to color my hair.  You start at the roots and finish to the tips in the second step.  Another plus for me was the smell wasn&#x27;t strong and the special conditioner provided makes your hair silky soft and provides help with lasting color.  I felt it is also reasonably priced and they have a great variety of colors to pick from.  The blonde I picked matched spot on and left pretty color tones/highlights in my hair.  The grey coverage didn&#x27;t seem to last for me but only about 4 weeks, however, as my hair is very thick, next time I will leave it on a little longer.  VS Salonist will definitely be my new fav!</li>
    <li> I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color from Bzzagent in the shade of dark brown to try. I thought the directions were very clear, however wish I had a friend to help apply and I found it a little tricky with my long hair to get full coverage. I It worked well for color coverage! The consistency is not as runny as other DIY hair colors, and stayed exactly where it was supposed to. I have read that the color fades too quickly, but so far so good. The smell was not too strong or chemical-ly. I ahve had numerous people compliment the shine and shade of the new color- which is always a plus!! I feel the conditioning is great- my hair has never been this soft in the middle of winter. I would suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I color my hair at home all the time and very rarely go to salon.It is affordable to color at home and while I&#x27;m waiting before rinsing it off . I can use my time doing something else like checking my e-mail etc or may be watching my favorite show. It is a win win situation for me. I got a Box of this product from BzzAgent to try it and give my opinions.The Opinion in this review are mine and I&#x27;m writing this after trying it out. I had never used a hair color with serum and this hair color kit has a tube of serum to to change the hair color formula into an easy to apply mixture, after the coloring the roots, get a customized hair color through out the hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried Vidal Sassoon Hair color before. So I definitely had mixed feeling of being a little bit excited and little bit of skeptical, not knowing what to expect.When I opened the box,I found that it had everything that I needed to color my hair like the mixing bowl, black colored non Latex gloves (I&#x27;m allergic to latex so this helps) and a cute brush to apply the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ll explain how to use it step by step,if you follow everything step by step then you can&#x27;t go wrong: It is a two step Process&lt;br /&gt;Step 1&lt;br /&gt;1. Put on the gloves and mix the entire contents of Tube 1 and the bottle in the mixing bowl.&lt;br /&gt;2. Mix with the Brush until the mixture looks all blended.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use 3/4 of the Mixture and reserve the 1/4 for the second step.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply it to the hair with the brush and wait for 30 minutes before the Second step.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;1.Mix the Serum contents in the remaining 1/4 mixture and mix thoroughly until the mixture looks well blended,&lt;br /&gt;2. Now you don&#x27;t need the brush for the second application. Leave your gloves on and smooth the entire contents in your hair.Wait for 10 minutes and rinse your hair thoroughly using a good quality Color safe shampoo of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;3.Use the Color Preserving Conditioner and leave it on for 2 minutes. Rinse itthoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty pleased with my results. This product gives us a Salon quality hair color from the comforts of our home and we don&#x27;t have to pay the salon price. I have black Colored hair and  I got  a perfect match for my hair color that I was born with. There are lots of other colors and hues available. My before and after pictures are posted here.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I received Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent  Kit Dark Auburn from Vidal Sassoon to apply to my hair and review. I have to honestly tell you that Dark Auburn (which I chose) would have been the wrong color for me. My fault, because I clicked on the wrong color. So, with the coupon they also sent with the kit, I bought Darkest Neutral Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the kit. The kit includes the color cream, activating lotion, serum, conditioner, brush, bowl and gloves. The bowl and black gloves were pretty nifty. You felt like you were a professional hair colorist when mixing the color cream, activating lotion and serum before applying. That said, I would suggest you have a partner to apply this. I did and for that reason, it was quick and easy to color my hair. The instructions were easy to follow. This is a 2 step process which I really liked. After applying the color mixture on the first step, you wait about 20 minutes.Then apply color mixture for the second step and wait 10 more minutes. Shampoo and use their conditioner.....you are done! See easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this color was a little darker than I wanted but I am impressed with the coverage. It really colored my gray, the roots, my hair is silky and soft to touch and the conditioner smells divine! We will see how long the color lasts and I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I have with this product is I really am not a fan of the brush. I love applying with the comb applicators because it is easier to apply especially if you are doing it yourself.  However, I think the brush covered and blended better than the combs generally do. So, I guess it depends on what you prefer when applying color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the process, the color coverage and will probably buy this again. Starting the new year with a new hair color was one of my resolutions of renewing myself and I think I did it!</li>
    <li> Awesome long lasting color.  This was very easy to use and it reminded me of going to a professional.  Not messy, there were several steps but overall worth it.  I got great color, true to the description and left my hair feeling great.  The instructions were easy to follow too.  I have tried several other hair color products and this is by far the best yet.  I will be searching this product out for many years.  The color seems to be long lasting 3 weeks and counting no dullness, fading or signs that it is time for another box.  I would recommend this product to anyone on a budget.  #gotitfree , i received a free sample of this product to try and i love it.  #@bzzagent #tryitfree</li>
    <li> I was impressed by this hair colour. I thought that I might be intimidated by it when I opened the box, but then after reading the simple instructions, I found it was quite easy and not complicated at all. There&#x27;s not a lot of detail in what you need to do. It&#x27;s simple and straightforward, and easy to use. I found the colour vibrant and covered up any signs of grey. The colour gave me nice shades of dark brown and I can honestly say I have been impressed with the colour. The smell was subtle and definitely not as strong as some of the hair colours I&#x27;ve used in the past. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was having to take the gloves off then put them back on after using them. That was a messy part. I would definitely use this product it again. I was provided this product by Vidal Sassoon to try.</li>
    <li> love the two step process, very easy with color that looks fresh and healthy. the color looks very natural and even between the roots and ends. would totally recommend this for at home color with salon results without the expense of a salon.</li>
    <li> I had received this product on behalf of Vidal Sassoon. However, my opinion on this product are my own. The Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent hair colour has a slightly different marketing scheme from other hair colouring products. It aims to give salon quality hair colouring by treating the roots and the lengths separately. This means that you colour your roots first and then the lengths of your hair to give it more depth and tones.  What I like about this product is that it was easy to follow the directions. The application process wasn&#x27;t much different from other hair colouring kits. The bottles were clearly labelled and the directions aid you step by step if you&#x27;re haven&#x27;t difficultly figuring out what to do.  The results was average this time around. There weren&#x27;t any odd patches and the shade ended up great (however it was nearly a match to my previous hair colour). It didn&#x27;t damage my hair and there wasn&#x27;t anything too disappointing about the product.  The kit itself was great in quality. It sort of reminded me of John Frieda&#x27;s Precision Foam colour, in which the gloves were great in quality and the items didn&#x27;t feel cheap.  That being said I&#x27;m pretty sure I could get the same results without having to do the roots separately from the lengths. Otherwise, this product didn&#x27;t wow me, nor was it disappointing. I just wish there was a hair colouring kit that provided more benefits relating to hair health.</li>
    <li> i got this kit from the vidal sasson brand to try it out.when i opened the box i was so happy cz it had all the things u need. it even has a mixing container and a brush for coloring. i followed the instructions carefully as it wasnt that complicated. and application was easy too!! no mess no foam. i liked the creamy smooth consistensy. as it made application smooth too!!i left the haircolor on for 30-35 mins. and thn washed itout.and used the conditioner as instructed. i was amazed by the results as my hair felt sooo soft and shiny after the color. some of the colors ive tried in past made my hair dry and stiff, straw like. bt this one didnt.i am totally converted to using this color now,and will definately recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> After having boring brown hair with some new gray coming in, I was excited to try a new dark blonde shade! Vidal Sassoon Salonist was so easy to use! I thought the two part process would be complicated, but it was not hard at all! And what I liked most about the color was the fact that it was nice and creamy and thick, not runny like most hair color. It stayed on the brush and then stayed on the hair and didn&#x27;t drip everywhere. It also had a pleasant scent and didn&#x27;t smell all chemically and strong. I accidentally got a drop of the haircolor on my arm and it didn&#x27;t burn my skin like most hair color does and it just wiped away easily and didn&#x27;t stain my skin. The tip on the special VS brush made it so easy to part the hair so the color could be applied to the roots. It was nice during the 20 minute wait because my scalp wasn&#x27;t burning and the color wasn&#x27;t dripping. That is problems I have experienced for years with at-home color kits! Then when I applied the rest after adding the serum, it was so easy to just scoop up the color in my hand and apply to the rest of the hair. The thick gloves were an added bonus, not those cheap, clear, and thin things that they call gloves that come with most hair color kits. When I rinsed the color out, I was surprised about how easily it came out. And the scent of the colour preserving conditioner was so nice and it was creamy and it only took a very small amount to work into my hair. While my hair air-dried, I was nervously anticipaing looking in the mirror at my hair. When I did, I was VERY pleased. With most at-home color kits, the color job looks cheap because the roots and the rest of the hair are different colors. Vidal Sassoon Salonist left my hair all the same color and looks like a professional did my hair. I love the dark blonde shade! It brightened my looks up completely, looks great with my skin tone and sets my green eyes off. My gray roots are all gone, too! My mother was the first person to see my hair and she loved it. She was very surprised to find out that it is an at-home color! She is going tomorrow to buy a Vidal Sassoon Salonist kit so she can do her own hair. I told my mom how easy the two process was and she is excited to try it, cover her gray, and get an exciting new look. Thank you Vidal Sassoon for letting me try this awesome new hair color! I will be buying this from now on when I need a new color! I can&#x27;t wait to tell my friends and the rest of my family about it and let them see my great new color! These coupons are sure going to come in handy!</li>
    <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist 2 step hair color for free in exchange for my honest opinion &amp;amp; review.  Prior to this, I had only heard of it, so getting to try this was wonderful way to try a quality product.  I chose to receive the Light Gold Brown because this sounded as close to the Honey Blonde color that I was used to.  My hair is naturally black, but I love to give it a sun-kissed light reddish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process was simple &amp;amp; self explanatory.  Addtionally, the direction sheet had step by step pictures to go along with each step.  The pictures ensured that I was going the steps properly before moving on to the next step.  The directions included were the best ones that I have ever come across when it comes to color-at-home kits.  Thank you Vidal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the colorizing cream was strong &amp;amp; ammonia like, but all semi &amp;amp; permanent dyes all have that smell.  They included a bowl of sorts for you to mix the solutions into, along with a brush (paint brush like) very much like a professional would use.  I loved using the brush instead of squirting the cream on.  In the 2 step process, you first apply it (paint it on) to the roots of your hair &amp;amp; then along your hairline.  After 20 minutes, you add the serum to the remaining dye &amp;amp; you work it through the rest of your hair for another 10 minutes.  You then shampoo your hair with a color safe shampoo &amp;amp; use the conditioner that they supply.  The Colour Preserving Condidtion smelled ok, but felt wonderfully thick &amp;amp; smoothing.  You could feel your hair detangling within seconds of applying it.  Before my hair was even dry, I could feel how much more softer it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results - The color was darker that what I am used to, but still looked like I had it done at a salon.  Almost all of my gray was gone except for a few stubborn hairs.  Since my hair has always had a hard time ridding itself of the grays, I was happy just to have been left witha few - and you have to know that they were there in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative was that Vidal should&#x27;ve suggested to use Vaseline to the hairline &amp;amp; to make sure that the dye doesn&#x27;t come in contact with ANYTHING.  In addition to my hairline area, my neck had splotches of brown, as did my arm (above the gloves), the sink &amp;amp; counter.  I thought enough to wear something that I didn&#x27;t mind getting stained &amp;amp; I&#x27;m glad I did because stain it did.  Just a cautionary note before the instructions would help others tremendously &amp;amp; would avoid any permanent discolorings.  I was able to scrub the stains from my skin &amp;amp; sink, but am still working on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this Salonist to any &amp;amp; all of my friends &amp;amp; family.  It does offer that salon like treatment by treating the roots first &amp;amp; then working on the rest of the hair.</li>
