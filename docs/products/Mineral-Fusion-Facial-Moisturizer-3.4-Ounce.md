      <li>I decided to use it daily, my skin is sooo much healthier!!</li>
      <li>I live in the desert</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So far, this is the one face cream that works well on my skin all year long (usually in winters, my skin gets super dry and rough. During summers, it gets oily). It absorbs easily, is not oily, doesn&#x27;t feel thick or heavy on my face, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  A pea-sized amount every day is all I need, and so the tube lasts a good while. When I ran out, I tried another moisturizer for about a week, but I immediately came back to this Mineral Fusion cream.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, temperamental skin. It has been difficult to keep it balanced since I was 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS product has helped. At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it seemed too thick, and honestly, after I randomly bought it, it sat in the drawer a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I decided to use it daily, my skin is sooo much healthier!! I exfoliate every other day, I have to use soap, scent free facial cleanser, Purpose, and adding this lotion to that routine has really helped heal and restore health to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin is so sensitive, I used to get a lot of red, dryness, and pimples. Not a good texture! Now, it is soft, smooth, healthy, the tone is balanced, I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried several other facial lotions, and I thought I really liked the one I used for over a year. Now I realize that one was oily, and this one is very balancing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful for this product!! I wish someone had recommended it to me - I could have been using it longer :)</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It has the most minimal scent, and is very thick but never caused me any breakouts. It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. The ingredients are superb. For my second order of this product I bought 3 containers because I loved it so much. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dry to very dry skin!</li>
    <li> Luxurious cream for the face. Softens and hydrates without an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product and I did not experience any drying of the skin. I used this cream during the day and applied sunscreen on top of it.</li>
    <li> Still using it. Only need a small amount to cover my face. Love the smell. Would definitely buy again if the price stays the same.</li>
    <li> My skin can get very dry and this lotion work perfectly to combat the dryness. It is just the right amount of deep hydration, absorbs quickly, and never leaves a greasy residue. I use it day and night. Love!</li>
    <li> There was a doctor on Dr. Oz who recommended finding a facial cream that contains copper. According to her, copper helps to rebuild collagen. This product contains copper, along with some other minerals, so I decided to try it. It&#x27;s not a miracle but I have seen some improvement in the over all appearance of my face. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I use this product, i keep comming back for more because I love the light texture and ingredients! Leaves my skin feeling amazing. I use it as a night cream</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream.  It goes on really smooth and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works well for my skin, not too greasy but gives it a nice balance of moisture. I have tried lots of different face creams before. The price is right too. I also do not like all the perfumed smells from some of the other creams and have broken out in a rash from some of the options that you can buy at local drug stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream now about two months and I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  I find that it has decent moisturizing power for the winter months when my skin is at it&#x27;s driest.  But I do feel like it sits a little heavy on top of my skin, I would like if it would absorb a little more deeply into the skin.  I also find I&#x27;m a little more shinny at the end of the work day, not terribly so but a bit more than I would like.  Overall though I am satisfied with how it works for me and will finish the bottle I have, but I think I will try a different product when it&#x27;s time to buy something new.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I bought it for the summer and it really just doesn&#x27;t do anything but smell good. I have to put it on a few times a day if I don&#x27;t want my face to feel tight and mind you it&#x27;s 83° and humid outside. It just really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, sometimes makes my face feel tighter. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Good facial cream supporting an important cause. The desert air is hard on my skin and this is the best facial cream for me.  And it smells great! The other Mineral Fusion products are also very good.</li>
    <li> I been using this for a few months.  Dr. Oz had and expert on the show that said moisturizer with copper in it was a helpful wrinkle reducer and a skin smoother.  I believe it works my skin feels and looks so much smoother.  I also use the eye cream from this company.</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot, but I should note, it is not &amp;#34;intensely hydrating&amp;#34;. Its a decent moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t feel like its super hydrating. I have combination skin so it works well for me, but if you have dry skin, I would look for another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin that is not particularly sensitive. After washing my face and putting  this on, my face stung and burned. I had to use it as a hand lotion instead. I have never had an experience like this with any facial moisturizer, I did exfoliate before but this shouldn&#x27;t happen and never has before. Look out!</li>
    <li> I was using the lotion but it was not enough.  Switched to the cream and it really did the trick!</li>
    <li> I have mature skin on the dry side so I bought this product with high hopes based upon the reviews it received.  I am very disappointed with its performance. The cream went on smoothly, was absorbed quickly and initially had a soothing and smooth finish. Several hours later, however, my skin felt dry and I noticed dry lines on my cheeks near my mouth. I thought I would just have to be patient and continued to apply it morning and evening.  After three days of use I developed red dry patches on my cheeks and discontinued using it. After a few days I tried the product again. Once again after two to three days the red patches were back now accompanied with a raised rash.  I stopped using it for a week, but took it with me for a short vacation trip. Yep, same reaction as the other two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I cannot recommend this product to anyone. I guess I have purchased the most expensive HAND cream ever!</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion and it makes my skin super soft! I use it at night and during the day and it really moisturizes my face! I live in the desert so I need a good moisturizer and this was a good price.</li>
    <li> Just as specified was a great deal...will order again</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This product moisturizes without clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> I have found that the wrinkles are slowly disappearing. What a wonderful product and&lt;br /&gt;priced right. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of my skin after application both morning and evening. It has a skin quenching feature. I have purchased several tubes and probably will continue. I share the purchases with 2 daughters. The scent is over the top.</li>
    <li> I started using this and the Mineral Fusion Facial Serum.  I tend to have dry and sensitive skin. I look for non-toxic products that do what they say they will do. This is very mild and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions and it has great hydrating properties. It seems to be great for mature skin as well.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on my face. Not oily but very moisturizing. Better ingredients than a lot of other lotions too.</li>
    <li> I have searched everywhere for a great inexpensive face moisturizer. This moisturizer does not make my face greasy or make me break out. It always leaves my skin feeling light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I got this because it is Paraben free and a pretty good value $$ for the ounces. I put just a couple dabs on my skin before -paraben free foundation and it has been very good to my skin. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective!  I noticed that a small scar near my eye has gradually decreased since I started using Mineral Fusion.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily, and my dry skin has greatly improved in two months. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate me at all and it is hydrating.</li>
    <li> I have been trying for years to find a face cream that would not break me out.  This is finally it!  It&#x27;s smooth and creamy, but not greasy.  It wears well at night and under my makeup.  I have very senstive skin and have been using other Mineral Fusion products with no problems so I decided to give this cream a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
    <li> great value, good product</li>
    <li> good product but it did cause me to break out</li>
</ol>
