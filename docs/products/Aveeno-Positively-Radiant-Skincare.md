      <li>I love using this.</li>

      <li>I see my skin clearing to a more even tone.  </li>
      <li>Silky smooth and very light</li>
      <li>took spots of my hands very quickly.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and it did not irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>At first I was very excited to use the product but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of early to tell about results</li>
      <li>It took several more weeks of use for me to notice much more change beyond that though.</li>
      <li>The product is worth the price tag.</li>
      <li>FIrst one I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>stuff really works!</li>
      <li>My overall tone looks more even.</li>
      <li>It absolutely, positively works.</li>
      <li>been using abut 4 days now seeing some positive changes wohooooo</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I think I would really like this product if it didn&#x27;t have fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say this does much of anything.  </li>
      <li>I used the entire tube as directed on some light spots on my arms &amp; it didn&#x27;t improve them at all.  </li>
      <li>It really did not make noticeable difference</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see that much of a difference yet.</li>
      <li>and when I finished the whole tube I took an after photo</li>
      <li>I am glad that is product has worked for other.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in to different dermatologists for my acne and scarring and have been prescribed things that just don&#x27;t really work quick</li>
      <li>and I felt like it just showed MORE of my dark spots.</li>
      <li>I have noticed MAJOR improvement in my dark spots and my skin tone is evening out nicely.</li>
      <li>My dark spots have faded fairly well although the spots are not completely gone yet.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
      <li>The product is not harsh, so my sensitive skin did not dry up or turn red, so I&#x27;m glad that the product is not super potent.</li>
      <li>and they look exactly the same on both sides of my face.</li>
      <li>I am 21 years old and have had acne and acne scars since I was 13 years old.</li>
      <li>i am on my second tube and have used it as instructed for 30 days and nothing has happened, the spots in my face are still very visible</li>
      <li>4 -5 packs to complete the job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on the back of my left hand and on the  right side of my chest, so that I can compare.  </li>
      <li>, a small acne tip: when popping pimples, make sure they are white, that is the only time they are ready to be popped.</li>
      <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t stick with it long enough, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference,</li>
      <li>and I really like the other products</li>
      <li>I have used for 2.5 months and it seems to be reducing the appearance of dark spots, but it certainly did not show any difference in two weeks as advertised.</li>
      <li>I have hyper pigmented skin and this did absolutely nothing to lighten my dark spots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a black woman 45 years old with sensitive skin and it has been working for me.  </li>

<li> I have not seen any major results using this product as the other reviewer claimed.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to continue using it until the tube is empty and check the final results.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s been a few months and the dark spots and scarring have almost disappeared completely!</li>
<li> This product worked very well, with all the expensive medicine that i received from dermatologist none worked, this product was my last straw, if it didn&#x27;t work, i was giving up on everything, but this product worked the same week that i tried it.</li>
<li> a couple weeks later my dark spot started getting darker</li>
<li> There was only a slight improvement in the look of dark spots, certainly not enough to keep buying the product.</li>
<li> Been using it twice a day for over 4 weeks; seems to very, very slowly but gently remove the darkened spots on the skin.</li>
<li> Only been using it for a few days, so can&#x27;t comment on results.</li>
<li> Not sure how long it takes to work, but really no results after 4 weeks.</li>
<li> Dark spots begin to fade I two weeks.</li>
<li> This is an Aveeno product, so I expect it to lighten my dark spots eventually.</li>
<li> Did not seem to lighten dark spot as I anticipated.  </li>
<li> The fight to fade my dark spots continue.</li>
<li> This product does what it claims, and fades dark spots after about 2 weeks.</li>
<li> but I wanted to lighten my dark spots and there was no difference at all.  </li>
<li> I bought this to lighten dark patches on my face.</li>
<li> I have dark spots.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t see any improvement for dark spot.</li>
<li> no change sad really.</li>
<li> Redness and scars are less noticeable.</li>
<li> It has lightened dark spots on my cheeks significantly in a few weeks.  </li>
<li> my nasty forehead&#x27;s spots are pretty much gone.</li>
<li> Well it&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks of use</li>
<li> I have to say I wasted money on this product</li>
<li> The formula is too heavy to use on my face.</li>
<li> I will need to order another few ounces to even everything out.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t do anything..don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Have used this for a few weeks, haven&#x27;t seen any changes - didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
<li> I started seeing results in less than 2 wks!</li>
<li> I can see very slight improvement .</li>
<li> I am 70 years old and had bad dark age spots on my head.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It absolutely, positively works. In 2 weeks, using it only once a day (the directions are twice a day) my nasty forehead&#x27;s spots are pretty much gone. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i love it! I started seeing results in less than 2 wks!</li>
    <li> Have been applying for a month haven&#x27;t experienced any change</li>
    <li> Dark spots begin to fade I two weeks.</li>
    <li> took spots of my hands very quickly.</li>
    <li> The cream scent is delicious, and it seems to be working as described.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I love using this. I apply it twice daily, and I have definitely noticed improvement in my skin. Redness and scars are less noticeable. My overall tone looks more even. It did take several weeks before I noticed improvement.</li>
    <li> I have faithfully used this product once a day for 6 months and have noticed a disappointing, VERY SLIGHT difference.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve used it for 6 months now, I wanted to give it a chance but I&#x27;ve noticed nothing.  My skin didn&#x27;t get irritated which is a plus but I wanted to lighten my dark spots and there was no difference at all.  I&#x27;m 65 and don&#x27;t have too many spots, but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and had bad dark age spots on my head. One tube of Aveeno Targeted Tone Corrector significantly decreased the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> FIrst one I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t break me out. Great product.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! I just have begun using to help lighten the scars on my face from acne, redness, etc and can already see great improvement! I can also see that my skin is softer, more even, and brighter. The smell is pleasant and it did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I really like this. It has a bit of retinol in it but it&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. There is no color - it&#x27;s just a cream to put on before or after moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face as instructed (morning and evening application) for almost two weeks. I have noticed MAJOR improvement in my dark spots and my skin tone is evening out nicely. The product is worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t stick with it long enough, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference,</li>
    <li> Love this product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to lighten dark patches on my face. I have olive skin and religiously used SPF 30 sunblock but this product did nothing after using almost a month.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s simply amazing....</li>
    <li> I try to use it twice a day because I have many sun spots. Things like this don&#x27;t usually work for me but this one is great</li>
    <li> I have dark spots. I have to say I wasted money on this product and I really like the other products but this one does not work. it didn&#x27;t lighten or change nothing no results and even took a pic for before till I was out of the tube and nothing no change sad really.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth and very light</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks of use I can see very slight improvement . I&#x27;m going to continue using it until the tube is empty and check the final results.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase.  It has lightened dark spots on my cheeks significantly in a few weeks.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think I would really like this product if it didn&#x27;t have fragrance. Only been using it for a few days, so can&#x27;t comment on results. It has a nice feel.</li>
    <li> Good product and service</li>
    <li> I have used for 2.5 months and it seems to be reducing the appearance of dark spots, but it certainly did not show any difference in two weeks as advertised.</li>
    <li> I just finished the entire tube of Aveeno Targeted Tone Corrector and am not at all wowed by the results. There was only a slight improvement in the look of dark spots, certainly not enough to keep buying the product.</li>
    <li> Does  not work.  Most of the  reviews are fake</li>
    <li> I have only used this product 2 weeks and have not noticed a difference yet. I will keep using it to the end and hope it will help soon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product continuously  over a month and have not noticed any reduction in the tone of my brown spots.  I am glad that is product has worked for other.  I will continue my search.</li>
    <li> Not sure how long it takes to work, but really no results after 4 weeks. Took a pic to compare and no difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of early to tell about results</li>
    <li> This product worked better than any expensive product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see any improvement for dark spot. It is ok for skin cream.</li>
    <li> used this product only twice and gave me a terrible allergic reaction. I have a swollen red face even after three days I stopped using this product. My face is like someone hit me. : /</li>
    <li> Have used this for a few weeks, haven&#x27;t seen any changes - didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, brown spots faded within 2 weeks as described.</li>
    <li> Speedy shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> still not sure about this product but i&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now, i guess its working slowly and hopefully will see more results in the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I am seeing some diminishment in sun spots.  They are slowly fading.  I will need to order another few ounces to even everything out.</li>
    <li> At first I was very excited to use the product but a couple weeks later my dark spot started getting darker</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see that much of a difference yet. Maybe too soon to tell, been using for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any major results using this product as the other reviewer claimed.  I used to use Olay Targeted Tone  Enhancer and liked the product.  However it was hard to find.  I would not buy Aveeno again.</li>
    <li> It really did not make noticeable difference</li>
    <li> I used the entire tube as directed on some light spots on my arms &amp; it didn&#x27;t improve them at all.  Obviously, I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Aveeno products are prettt good, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 wee now, no difference but I&#x27;m having patience to see results....I think my skin is so stubborn.</li>
    <li> Been using it twice a day for over 4 weeks; seems to very, very slowly but gently remove the darkened spots on the skin.</li>
    <li> This product is working well. I&#x27;m a black woman 45 years old with sensitive skin and it has been working for me.  I see my skin clearing to a more even tone.  Quite happy with it and will buy it again</li>
    <li> This product worked very well, with all the expensive medicine that i received from dermatologist none worked, this product was my last straw, if it didn&#x27;t work, i was giving up on everything, but this product worked the same week that i tried it. I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on the back of my left hand and on the  right side of my chest, so that I can compare.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in skin tone.  The formula is too heavy to use on my face.</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims, and fades dark spots after about 2 weeks. It took several more weeks of use for me to notice much more change beyond that though. The product is not harsh, so my sensitive skin did not dry up or turn red, so I&#x27;m glad that the product is not super potent. I have a prescription strength dark spot cream that works faster, but it was very expensive. This is a good affordable product.</li>
    <li> I am 21 years old and have had acne and acne scars since I was 13 years old. I&#x27;ve been in to different dermatologists for my acne and scarring and have been prescribed things that just don&#x27;t really work quick enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it each time after I wash my face. It&#x27;s been a few months and the dark spots and scarring have almost disappeared completely! My skin tone as been evened out and my face has NEVER looked so clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a small acne tip: when popping pimples, make sure they are white, that is the only time they are ready to be popped. DO NOT attack it and get it all bloody, THAT is when the scarring happens. Be sure to eat healthy and drink lots of water as well! Acne products DON&#x27;T work on their own! You have to help taking care of yourself too!</li>
    <li> I like the smoothness it leaves my face, not oily or greasy. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks but haven&#x27;t noticed any fading of my sun spots. I&#x27;ll give it some more time and see what happens. sorry couldn&#x27;t be more helpful..</li>
    <li> I have hyper pigmented skin and this did absolutely nothing to lighten my dark spots. I took a before photo and when I finished the whole tube I took an after photo and they look exactly the same on both sides of my face. I used it twice a day like the directions on the box said until the last drop but still no difference. The fight to fade my dark spots continue.</li>
    <li> Did not seem to lighten dark spot as I anticipated.  Will try another product!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything..don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> sorry to say this but: Aveeno Positively Radiant Targeted tone is a fraud!!!! i am on my second tube and have used it as instructed for 30 days and nothing has happened, the spots in my face are still very visible I am very disappointed and will never buy it again nor will i recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is an Aveeno product, so I expect it to lighten my dark spots eventually.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a month now.  My dark spots have faded fairly well although the spots are not completely gone yet.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It did have effects but it seems it will take approx 4 -5 packs to complete the job.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say this does much of anything.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Hated it! Made me break out and I felt like it just showed MORE of my dark spots. Never ever again!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> been using abut 4 days now seeing some positive changes wohooooo</li>
</ol>
