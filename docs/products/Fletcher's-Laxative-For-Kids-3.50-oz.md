    <li> My Son gets constipated frequently. He doesn&#x27;t particulary like the rootbeer taste but it does work for him. It will usually make him go in a few hours and he doesn&#x27;t seem to get crampy. I just wish it came in other flavors, rootbeer is so random.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My Mom used for me. I used it for my kids and now my daughter is using it for her children.</li>
    <li> Love this gentle laxative for my little ones. Amazon is the only place I can find it. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This prodcut helped to save my cat from dying when he became impacted! Thank to you Fletcher&#x27;s my kitty is healthy and happy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase this product since it&#x27;s discontinued in store. This products works wonders I use to use Fletcher when I was young.</li>

    <li> This is awesome!  My kids do not like the taste of Castor Oil, although it is the most natural option for laxatives.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase.  They are not really constipated kids because we eat whole natural foods and plenty of vegetables as well as fruits.  However, when we do a parasite cleanse I needed an option that was gentle but able to flush them out.</li>
    <li> It works fine, kids like it but it is just like any other cola laxative.  There are less expensive brands.  But this does work fine.</li>
    <li> My children never have complained with this flavor, and it is gentle on their systems.  I have tried similar products and return to this as the gold standard for reliability and safety.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles form the local pharmacy for my son. They taste &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;Just like&amp;#34; root beer. The cost was about $2 less per bottle on Amazon, so I bought it here. This does not taste very good. There is a root beer flavor to it, but the aftertaste is not good. Now it is hard to get him to take his medicine. Not worth the $2 savings. The bottles and packaging looks identical, but there is a definite taste difference.</li>
    <li> I have used Fletcher&#x27;s from my youth and now at almost 74 still using it.  Like they say, if it works don&#x27;t fix it.  I enjoyed the taste, the ease of using and the amazing results.  Thanks for keeping a good thing a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had with this order is being an individual and ordering 4 at once in Jan.2014 is they all expire in March 2014.  Could never use that much in such a short time.  My loss.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> My newborn is lactose intolerant she was switched to soy milk, the soy milk kept her constipated. I gave her .5 ml daily and it worked miracles. After about 2 months she was able to go on her own!</li>
    <li> Same as the old Fletcher&#x27;s Castoria. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> My son isn&#x27;t crazy about the rootbeer flavor, but this product certainly does the trick when he needs it! Like the bigger size as well.</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t make anything better at taking care of occasional constipation!  Have used this product for more than 30 years, and it really does work.  The great taste makes it so easy for kids to take!</li>
    <li> Well I needed to s%^&amp;! And this stuff made me s%^&amp;! Tastes like Root Beer!! I f@#$ing love ROOT BEER!&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, we had a kid that wasn&#x27;t pooping at all. Like maybe once a week. So we gave him fletcher&#x27;s for kids. He pooped. Now he goes like every other day. Large improvement.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my granddaughter.  She sometimes needs a little help with a laxative.  This is a great product!  My mother told me when our oldest son was born to make sure I always have this product on hand.  I could not find it in the local drugstores and again Amazon came to the rescue!!!!!  Thank you, Amazon.......</li>
    <li> Used it as a kid and give it to my kids.  They love the taste</li>
    <li> a very gentle laxative great for children and adults. the flavor and results was just what i neededI strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy for kids to drink.</li>
