    <li> This product is the bomb!  Love the amazing smell, how easily it&#x27;s applied, how quickly it&#x27;s absorbed and especially love the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, unlike The Honest Company sunscreen.  Glad I ordered the two pack, one at home and one at our family cottage!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  My daughter used it all summer for summer camp and didn&#x27;t get burned.  She also has very sensitive skin.  We have tried several brands of natural sunscreen.  With one she got a sunburn, another burned her eyes when she sweated and another gave her a rash.  She was OK with Thinksport.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunblock. All ingredients are as listed and the product feels so nice on skin. It rubs in well and does not dry my skin like other natural sunblocks I have used. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the ingredients and the sunscreen protection of this product!</li>
    <li> A sunscreen that has safe ingredients and no complaints from the family. Wore it in Hawaii to the beach and did not get burned. Will continue to purchase. Not very greasy, rubs in nicely.</li>
    <li> A little hard to rub in but great otherwise.  Nice scent and quality ingredients!</li>
    <li> Works great; not greasy; bit pricey but I will order it again</li>
    <li> My husband burnt within three hours (with liberal initial application, and a liberal reapplication after about an hour and a half)-no swimming or strenuous activity. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen worked.  It protected my son and myself from the getting burned.  But on the other hand.  Every time we used it and were in the sun for any length of time, his skin flared up with eczema.  Now, even though eczema does run in my family, my son and I never have any flare ups.  We&#x27;ve used other name brand sunscreen in the past with no issues.  I also broke out with blemishes the one time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed because I know this is one of the healthier sunscreens on the market and I really wanted to be able to use it.  Anyone with out a history of sensitive skin or eczema in their family, I would definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. I use this at softball tournaments on myself and all my children. We will be outside for several hours in the Arizona sun and not get burned.  It smells much better than other natural brands I&#x27;ve bought. It is a little hard to rub in at first but is well with it and not as greasy as others.  I even use it on my face under my makeup. Quite a few of the other team moms also have started using it and swear by it!</li>
    <li> Our kids go to a summer camp where they spend the better portion of each day outside in the sun.  I was looking for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t protect them from skin cancer only to subject them to other risks from all of the chemicals used.  I chose this one based on others&#x27; reviews of the feel, smell etc.  It has worked very well, the scent is light and quite pleasant -- and, importantly -- no sunburns!  The kids still periodically complain they would prefer to use the &amp;#34;spray kind,&amp;#34; but I have yet to find one that is acceptable to me.  While it does leave a slightly white cast right after you put it on, that seems to go away after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This works without harsh chemicals.  Keeps the sun off without leaving you feeling greasy.  I buy it over and over.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite everyday sunscreen. It&#x27;s a good value, has a pleasant smell, and blends in fairly well.</li>
    <li> Lovely light scent and provided good sun protection while my family and I were out at the beach for 3 hours.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  We loaded up on this stuff (family of 4) before a trip to San Diego.  None of us got a sunburn while wearing and reapplying every couple hours in the sun, and just after getting out of the pool, etc.  This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> Seems to work and has a pleasant scent</li>
    <li> Best physical sunscreen out there. It works in water (reapply after) and I can return from a weekend at the beach as pale as when I arrived.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  No scent, easy to apply &amp; none of the harsh chemicals that are in most common brands of sunscreen.  My daughter requested it this year!</li>
    <li> This is our favorite sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Lowest toxicity score for sunscreen.  Rubs in just as easily as conventional sunscreen.  Protects well against burns.  Best natural sunscreen I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many brands)</li>
