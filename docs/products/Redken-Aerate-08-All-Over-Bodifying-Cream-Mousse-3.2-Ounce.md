    <li> Bought two of these, one for my son.  His hair us thick and curly while mine is fine.  It works well for both of us.</li>
    <li> This product has fixed my styling woes.  I have very fine straight hair and it blows away and won&#x27;t curl.  Now when I blow it dry with a round brush it stays put but still feels nice.  My daughter has fine curly hair and she found that it tamed her hair too.  You only need to use a little bit.  Feels sticky when you put it on but it dries so you can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
    <li> It works great if you read the directions and don&#x27;t use too much</li>
    <li> I like the product.  Less perfume smell would be five stars.</li>
    <li> This is the best mousse I have ever used. The packaging allows me to use only what I need so the jar lasts me a long time. I actually saved a bit of money ordering through Amazon instead of buying it at the salon. This works very well on my hair, which is coarse and naturally curly. It holds up well and keeps my hair from being frizzy on humid days.</li>
    <li> Nice product.It does fluff the hair and thus voluminizes, but the hold is not enough, at least for me. I have to use a small amount of sculpting gel (in addition) for this. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> Creates needed volume, scent isn&#x27;t overpowering,  one of my goes to. .only wish it had a pump</li>
    <li> This prodict works great with my short hair--I will be buying it over and over.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse.  Only takes a little, holds wonderfully and smells great!</li>
    <li> Helps to prevent my hair from frizzing.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for my very fine, unmanageable hair.  It helps me style it and the style stays in all day.  I have already purchased my 2nd container.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, body building mousse which really helps give body to my limp, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Helps give me Fuller Hair  Thanks</li>
    <li> I like this mousse because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it has a ton of product on it.</li>
