<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush arrived quickly. I use it to apply foundation and it makes a huge difference! You&#x27;re getting a great product at an amazing price!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush ! Wasn&#x27;t quite sure how it would be seeing it&#x27;s so inexpensive , but it&#x27;s awesome ! Shipped to my house much much sooner than expected date , which was a pleasant surprise. The seller has quick and excellent customer service skills, he emails you to update and to see how you like your products . Very satisfied customer and will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Totally not what I expected for such cheap price! I have other brushes and this one works best for my daily use. Blends very well I just love it and will defenetly be ordering from this seller again. Shipped pretty quick and great customer service that I must give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant buying this product, but I figured with the price, I had nothing to lose. The brush was delivered SO quickly, and it&#x27;s amazing quality. The bristles are super soft and it applies make up very well. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my liquid foundation, i wasn&#x27;t expecting very much from it but its way better than i thought. Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying it 👍</li>
    <li> I love it. it puts my makeup on very nice and smooth. I use it for my concelear and foundation.</li>
    <li> very good brush, exactly as I expected, firm, good quality and nice over all. Would recommend it to others) .</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly! Worth the wait, it&#x27;s an amazing dupe for the sigma f80 flat top kabuki. I use it for foundation for a flawless finish and it&#x27;s super soft but also dense enough to blend and apply foundation evenly! Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been watching youtube tutorials of a few &amp;#34;makeup gurus&amp;#34; and one in particular recommended a similar brush to this but it was a Sigma brush. This brush is primarily used to put on liquid foundation so as I did a little research into &amp;#34;foundation brushes&amp;#34; I ran across this one that had pretty good reviews on it and was alot cheaper than the Sigma brush. So I thought I would give it a try. I wanted a different way to apply my foundation other than sponges and/or my fingers. So I got this brush and absolutely love it! The bristles are thick and shorter than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; type of brush and my foundation goes on super easy too! It doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the brush or spread around the bristles - all the foundation goes directly on my face instead of into the brush itself. And I use LESS foundation that I did before, which saves me money and that&#x27;s always great!! If you&#x27;re thinking of getting a good well great brush to apply liquid foundation, I highly recommend this brush and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my foundation. It make a difference. Very soft bristle and nice looking brush. I have own many other foundation brush but this one is the most I reach for. Will recommend to others and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great brush and great price. It&#x27;s perfect for foundation. It doesn&#x27;t leave bristles on your face or anything! Love it!!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical when I ordered it, but once I got it I emediatly loved it! It&#x27;s really soft and it gives a flawless finish when putting on my foundation and consealer. I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this type of brush for a long ass time but every thing else was too expensive. So once I found this I had to get it. So far non of the hair has fallen out which was a plus. Really great brush for an unbeatably price for sure.</li>
    <li> I was shock to know that it blends out my makeup very well. The first day of using it, I got so many compliments and people asking what type of brush was I using.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I was surprised how well it worked for the price. I&#x27;m thinking about buying one for a friend!</li>
    <li> Very Good brush for the price, feels like a good quality brush, not cheap at all! I will recommend this brush and I will purshase it again. Great for my foundation. great deal!!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this brush, I was a little hesitant because I hadn&#x27;t had much luck buying makeup brushes from amazon. I am so glad that I decided to get it because it is probably the best quality brush I own. I would say it is a cheaper option for the sigma F80 brush. I literally use it everyday. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever! Multi use! Super super SOFT BRISTLES I paid 92 for a brush that sucked! This one was way Less then that and the Quality is extremely High so professional easy to handle and clean. Gosh did I mention SUPER SOFT. I just cannot believe this great fine. Divas please get. Especially if you do photo shoots (trust me). feels so good on face and does the job.</li>
    <li> fabulous amazing high quality brush ,i use it with my mehron cream foundation ,my face is flawless when i use this brush,don&#x27;t judge the price before you give it a try ,just buy it and you won&#x27;t regret ,love love love love .</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush from alwaysonline since I was looking for a dupe of the Sigma F80 and the reviews were all glowing, plus they offered free shipping. It took about a week for the brush to come back into stock, but it arrived shortly after shipping, which was convenient. When the brush arrived, I took it out of the packaging and immediately noticed how soft the bristles were. I gave it a quick wash and used it during my usual makeup routine the next morning. I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and even it made my foundation go on! I felt like I finally achieved that &amp;#34;airbrushed look&amp;#34; makeup gurus talk about. And for half the price of the F80, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I would definitely repurchase/recommend this to my friends!</li>
    <li> This brush is good for oily to normal skin but definitely not dry. It made my dry, flaky patches look so much worse. I wish I could use this brush but I would definitely recommend to oily to normal skinned people :)</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is comparable to the Sigma F80 brush but a fraction of the cost! It gives me a flawless finish and uses very little product. The brush is so soft and very well made. The shipping was amazing!! It took only one week! I would buy from the seller again! Great product! Affortable!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! It is fabulous for blending in your foundation! It&#x27;s soft! AND it&#x27;s cheap! I would only have to say there is one little tiny down side and that is from time to time I&#x27;ll have a bristol fall out onto my face while applying my foundation. But like I said very miner error especially for the wonderful pay of it gives!</li>
    <li> This brush is the softest make up brush I have ever owned. I deep cleaned it with conditioner which made it even softer, it applies my concealer perfectly and I do not regret buying this product whatsoever. I highly recommend this for an amateur AND a professional make up artist, great brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush thinking that it would deliver my bareminerals flawlessly. However this brush is amazing with regular liquid foundation baby! It spreads it evenly because it&#x27;s a brush that is packed tight! No shedding issues and the new smell is just that...NEW! Try it! I should have gotten two!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this brush. I waited and waited, but it never came. It doesn&#x27;t even show up in my amazon orders anymore. I paid for it, and it just disappeared. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you actually want to receive it...</li>
    <li> I use this every. single. day. for my foundation and powder and I&#x27;m in LOVE. Perfect price and quality and I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I use it mostly for foundation, and it works extremely well. The bristles are soft, and did not come out after many washes. Also works well for powder.</li>
    <li> This brush came in in a little more than a week it came in fast and neatly. It is very soft and the bristles dont fall off and its only 6$!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I use it everyday to apply my liquid foundation (I use MAC pro longwear), and it works well in blending! It helps to distribute the product smoothly without lines. I suggest buying this, and the price is great!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes I have! Makeup goes on flawlessly.  For such a cheap price...I would order several. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> After a few washes all the bristles fell off. Yes, I washed the brushes correctly. The brush it&#x27;s self is super soft and works amazing, maybe I just got a defective brush but I loved it until then. Buy at your own risk. (and I think it was the third was when it broke)</li>
    <li> i am in love with it (: let me know when yall have more specials like this again, it really helpped out with my budget</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this!! it was very inexpensive and had nice reviews, and it shipped super fast! but it sheds like CRAZY. i might wash it to see if that helps but it may make it worse.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful foundation brush for liquid or powdered mineral foundation.. I used to use my fingers to apply liquid foundation but when i use this brush, my skin looks smooth, velvety, and flawless.. I just buff the makeup into my skin in a circular motion, and it looks amazing. I will never be without one of these brushes again if I can help it.. I bought one for my friend too, and she loves hers. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. You should get this, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described. Doesn&#x27;t shed, and applies makeup beautifully. Probably the same exact thing as the sigma F80</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft. No shedding and it blends your foundation into your skin very nicely. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD.....GET THE JOB DONE! LAST A LONG TIME! INEXPENSIVE....CANT BEAT THIS DEAL ....I WILL BE GETTING MORE SOON PERFECT GIFT</li>
    <li> Love love love this is now my new foundation brush and I use mostly MAC and this stands right next to it being soft and easy to use will be buying tons more brushes from this seller</li>
    <li> It was a nice, ok brush. Very soft. But the handle came off when I was cleaning it. I probably could had bought a nicer one at walmart for less.</li>
    <li> As many reviewer said, this brush is just like the sigma F80, and much more affordable, so it is really your choice&lt;br /&gt;I have both of them, and let me tell you, I had this one first, but I kept thinking I could do a little bit better if I just had the sigma F80, I was just thinking like a makeup maniac..lol any way!, when I got the sigma F80 I was shocked :-O it is the exact same brush, oh not sorry is not the exact same thing, because the sigma F80 is more expensive!!!! it is the only difference, but I had to have it! smh</li>
    <li> These brushes are so amazing that I bought some more from the seller. I use them wet to apply body makeup and it blends so beautifully. Comparative brushes are 3x the price. I&#x27;m super happy and highly recommend this seller. Plus got them in under 2 wks from china which was great.</li>
    <li> This foundation brush works very well an smoothly I was very impressed when I received my brush and it works great so do yourself a favor and buy it !</li>
    <li> This brush is the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever owned and I own a LOT of brushes!&lt;br /&gt;It blends everything perfectly, from foundation to blush and everything in between! :)</li>
    <li> first i wanna say that the hairs on the brush are great, they are really soft and i haven&#x27;t experienced any hairs falling off. secondly i wanna say that the packaging sucks, they could have put it in a small box or something, i don&#x27;t pay shipping and handling for nothing. when i got this brush there was a big dent on it so the metal part of the brush isn&#x27;t completely circular. also when i was feeling around to see if it was sturdy they wooden handle came off, so i had to crazy glue the product together.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time, in excellent conditions and just as described by the seller. The brush is soft and firm. Great for applying foundation cream because it gives an even and total coverage. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great make up brush. I used it for liquid foundation and it applied it smoothly without streaks. Love it</li>
    <li> Ever since someone told me to buy a Kabuki brush, my days of wearing makeup have changed! I am in LOVE with the Kabuki brush and highly recommend it for those of you who put on liquid foundation every day. It goes on so much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used. Tip: try dabbing this on instead of smearing - it lasts so much longer!</li>
    <li> I use this brush everyday to apply my foundation and it works wonderful. I have purchased other more expensive brush and this one is cheaper and works better.</li>
    <li> after about a week with out washing the brush the hairs started to come out.. but as long as you clean it about 2X a week it&#x27;s a AWSOME product for buffing, blending, and stippling!</li>
    <li> WOW! Are my exact words!! This brush is very very very sturdy! And the hairs are omg soft! I use this as my foundation brush and it blends it in than my beauty blender!</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this brush, I just wanted to see if it would make a difference other than using my fingers. This brush is AMAZING! It&#x27;s so soft and dense and shaped a lot better than I expected. I have only noticed one hair falling out since using it too. It really improves the covereage of my makeup and makes it look even more natural and airbrushed. I wear half the amount of makeup I used to since I started using this and it&#x27;s so easy to do! I think it would work as good as a Sigma flat top kabuki but I haven&#x27;t used one so I can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> omg!!! I thought I was not going to like the brush  or it was going to be cheap since the price was cheaper than others but I absolutely love it!! thank u!</li>
    <li> Received it sooner than expected. Looks just like picture, works like the sigma brush. Perfect size, bristles, and works wonders on your face. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> been using this brush for a couple weeks now, and it has been amazing. Never used a flat top brush and has changed how my make up looks. Great quality</li>
    <li> I am so surprise at how well made this brush is. It&#x27;s really soft and quite dense. It apply powder foundation perfectly. This is my first stippling brush so I don&#x27;t have any other to compare it too. But I guess I don&#x27;t need any other. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> my sister loves this brush.she has hard time fine good brush so glad brought two for her and loves how make goes on and the hair does not fall out.i glad could make her happy.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, dense, and easy to clean.  I use it for foundation and it works great!  I personally clean it after each use with soap .  If foundation sticks too much, I use dish detergent.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing ! I always thought with my dry skin I would never be able to use one of these but this made it happen I&#x27;ve had so much trouble with other foundation brushes in the past but this one is soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry skin it&#x27;s dense and it gives a flawless finish. It shipped before I knew it and arrived even faster. Seller was very professional and very helpful. This brush is perfect and worth it</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product mainly because of the price tag but HOT DAMN do I LOVE this brush! It glides my foundation on like I was buffing my face with a baby angels wings! The bristles are softer and thicker than I imagine Benedict Cumberbatch&#x27;s hair to be and the nice fat handle makes for super easy use for anyone with carpal tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shed a tiny bit at the beginning but any brush is likely to have a little bit of that happen when you break it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to brush now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies and Gents this brush is sweeter than candy, hotter than the surface of the sun and cheaper than Scrooge McDuck! I have spent upwards of 30 dollars on brushes just as good as this little guy and been no more impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting out in the makeup game, you want this brush.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re an old pro tired of spending every penny you come across on quality tools, you want this brush.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to buy for your SO who loves cosmetics, you want this brush.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much due to the price but I was presently surprised. It came faster than listed and it is a great quality. It did have a faint plasticy smell but it went away after I washed it. The bristles are nice and soft with no fall out and it blends well.</li>
    <li> fast shipping..good quality.soft hair, i like it very much .. .good choice for everybody. ..i recommend it ...do now to buy it</li>
    <li> This brush took me by surprise by how soft the bristles are and how evenly it spreads the foundation compared to expensive name brands out there. It definitely does the job and I am very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had read great reviews and decided to give it a go. I was kinda wanting the Sigma, but this is not too shabby and has held up well :)</li>
    <li> I always wanted one and I got one for this price, then I surprised by the good quality for your money.</li>
    <li> Its a great brush. The packing was a disappointment. The brush was unwrapped in a bubble envelope. Not what I was expecting, especially since its for my face!</li>
    <li> Too soft and after I washed it, it seems like I could never fully remove the foundation residue or BB Cream residue.  Cheap brush, price reflects quality.</li>
    <li> makes my foundation go on and look perfect. I cant see  myself applying foundation with out it. inexpensive with great result.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best brush but it gets the job done, you get what you pay for so honestly just go and buy yourself a nice brush at the store or the ELF brush just like this one</li>
    <li> I really love this brush! It applys my foundation perfectly and gives me a full coverage look even with bb cream! The only cons is it took about 3 weeks to get here and some of the outside bristles are falling limp, just a couple so nothing I can&#x27;t pluck. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush! I washed it as soon as I got it and there was no fall out, it is well put together, feels strong. Came faster than I expected. Feels really good on my face. I use it to smooth out my BB Cream and help blend my look.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush...... Yeah when I received the pack it did smell weird.  But I washed it and now there is no smell.  My skin is sensitive and I wanted a soft brush like this one........  So I got it</li>
    <li> The best !!!!!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t shed and very soft ! No complains what so ever ! I would purchase another one</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is smooth and blends the foundation great it is thick as well Must buy this brush now !!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to buy the Sigma brush then found this. Couldn&#x27;t believe all the raving reviews, but they&#x27;re RIGHT!!! This brush is amazing. Changed the way I apply my makeup, transformed the application -- looks so much better. Just an excellent brush, would never guess that it costs $6 (now it&#x27;s even cheaper... under $5!), feels and looks fantastic. LOVE IT, thank you. It arrived within 2 weeks, pretty fast. Just the best, VERY HAPPY!!!</li>
    <li> i like the brush but the brush hair keeps on falling out. It is inconvenient when I wash the brush.</li>
    <li> The brush came sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise. It&#x27;s a very good brush and has been working great since I got it (I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for about a month) and none of the hairs have fallen out either. Sold at a great price considering how well the brush works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying it and I would definitely buy the same brush if I happen to lose the one I have now.</li>
    <li> Accurate description and pictures. Very affordable price! It&#x27;s softer than I expected it to be, and although I haven&#x27;t tried it out, it seems like it will work wonderful. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Pretty good brush. I had read other reviews about the bristles falling out. This has not happened to me. I really do like this brush. Gives a flawless look.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It makes my make up look flawless and very smooth. I&#x27;m never using a sponge applicator ever ever again</li>
    <li> This brush works very well. It is quite an effective tool for even application. This is my first kabuki brush and a wise purchase. Considering my budget, lack of experience, and needs, I would say this brush is a good way to learn, compare, and experiment with. Currently, it suits my needs and hopefully it will last.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I want to buy the Sigma F80 brush but it not cheap so I wanted to try something like it I found this for $3.98 and I thought why not. I rated it a 5 star because it has good quality their no fall out, they packaging/outside of brush is nice a slick and easy to hold in the hand. I liked that it was $3.98, that it&#x27;s easy to hold, the feel of the brush, the only thing that I would say I dislike is that I thought it was going to be the size of the Sigma brush and it was a little shorter but not a drastic amount or anything like that. I would recommend this to anyone in my situation if you look to buy the Sigma brush but it to expensive at the moment this is a great duo. of the Sigma brush. I think you should definitely get this and it&#x27;s only $3.98!!!</li>
    <li> Thickly packed but not stiff&lt;br /&gt;Gives good coverage&lt;br /&gt;MINIMAL hair fallout (literally one hair a month)&lt;br /&gt;A great dupe for expensive brushes</li>
    <li> Do not spend 40$ on sigma brush!!!!! This is the best brush so far,this is all a need for my daily markup.</li>
    <li> to start! delivery was estimated January 10th - Jan 28th. I said WTF! OMG! I ordered them on Dec 14th. I got them today Christmas Eve all the way from freaking China! So that is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I wish i could post a vid on these brushes. its dense and soft. i have not washed them or applied make up but they feel great on my skin. the handle is glued tight. Seem like great quality for the price! I ordered this along with their Tapered Kabuki, Angled Kabuki along with the 4 piece eye shadow blending brushes. and the same goes for all of them. they are all uniform in quality and texture. so i will probably just copy and paste this for the other ones as well instead of writing a review for each individual brush. they are all great and would recommend them.</li>
    <li> The brush does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do .&lt;br /&gt;The brush isn&#x27;t shedding!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s most important that the brush doesn&#x27;t leave brush hairs on my face when applying makeup , and it doesn&#x27;t !</li>
    <li> I love this brush because its so soft and works great with foundation for a flawless coverage! totally love it!</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! This brush is awesome with liquid foundation. No brushes stroke, it doesn&#x27;t absorb all the product, and cleans really nicely!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I purchased this brush, since so many cheap brushes are just that...cheap. But to my lovely surprise this brush was a keeper! I use this brush to buff out my liquid foundation, and it works beautifully. A great dupe to the Sigma F80 brush, and for such a handsome price! I was worried at first how it would hold up to deep cleaning it, I was afraid the hairs would fall out or the brush would dry all stiff and be ruined. However that wasn&#x27;t the case, I dried it with the bristles facing down and it was as good as new! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t regret for a minute I bought this.  It works great and the price was cheap.  An outstanding bargain.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, blends out my foundation to perfection. Bristles are so soft, and the price is just right! Thanks!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great price, and good customer service.  Got to me quicker than I thought it would.  Would recommend.  Very soft and works well.  Clean up is simple and quick.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal! This is a quality brush. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with the price but was just so happy when I got it! It&#x27;s great for buffing on your foundation, blending your concealer, using cream blush or bronzer. Great brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this, I mean I use it but the brush retained some of my foundations color after washing it? Maybe it&#x27;s just my foundation but none of my other brushes had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package itself came ripped almost entirely opened and it looked like it had been tossed around with other heavier packages smashing on top of it, causing the handle to have a huge dent and wood chipped off. What a bummer, buy at your own risk since this is a product coming from China.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, truly amazed at how this Kabuki Brush feels and how easily it applies makeup. The Ailunce ...Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki Brush is the best makeup applier I have ever used in thirty years. This is for everyone.</li>
    <li> This brush blends really well, but once I cleaned it, the bristles started to come out. It&#x27;s good for the price, but if you wear makeup everyday. And u clean your brush frequently, this is not the brush for you</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it for a few weeks before I did a review. When I got the brush it was so soft it didn&#x27;t smell or anything it came in a lot earlier than expected! After 1 week a couple of strands were sticking out an I cut them off  but has not since then. This brush makes your foundation look wonderful I would compare it to the sigma f80 but this brush is way cheaper!! I am still using it an it an amazing brush I would buy this again! :)</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for the last 6 months, and used it daily to apply liquid foundation.  I LOVE IT!  It has not shed at all, and it blends wonderfully!  I have recommended it to several ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this - my brush was shipped from China and took over 3 weeks to arrive... BUT, the shipping was free and the price was VERY reasonable, so it was worth the wait in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Most amazing brush for such a great price! I wOuld recommend this brush to everybody! It took a while to get to me but it was totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Great knock off of the sigma flat kabuki. Took a little long with shipping but I was such a happy girl when it arrived! Use it everyday:)))</li>
    <li> I received this before estimated delivery date. No problems what so ever. I love the way my make up looks when using this! It&#x27;s very soft! Even after I wash it, once it dries it&#x27;s back to being soft. :)</li>
    <li> I use this brush on a daily basis. It spreads the product so smoothly across the skin, and doesn&#x27;t absorb very much of the product either. Plus it doesn&#x27;t shed which I have dealt with before put this brush is perfect</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t got my brush I had to email them asking whats going on?? and there sending me a new one till than this is a no bueno for me .... but hope its worth the month wait</li>
    <li> this spend up my morning process a lot. it helps give a smooth flawless application!!!&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice and soft against the skin and I love how dense it it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!! I didn&#x27;t get it in the mail!!!! Paid in full!!</li>
    <li> It works exactly sigma flat top brush. I have had this for 6 month and use it at least 4 times a week with no fall outs. I have also washed it several time. Why would anyone want to pay more.</li>
    <li> Great brush for a great price. Helps achieve an airbrushed look to foundation. The bristles are soooo soft. Shipping took a while, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing!!! It applies foundation so flawlessly. The brush is very soft and dense. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. Definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Going to order more</li>
    <li> I loved it as soon as I opened it! So soft and works amazing! My favorite brush and so inexpensive. I have had it for over week and I have had no problems with it. I would definitely purchase this again and or recommend it.</li>
    <li> The bristles or kind of hard idk maybe I should soak it in hot water to loosen</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant of buying it since the price is to good to be true, but I waited for a couple of weeks before I wrote a review. Let me first say that it is soft as the MAC 187 stippling brush-it is super soft! The quality is great and the brush did not loose hairs, so far. The handle is chubby, but I have small hands, yet it is still nice. I also though that it might not be great since the price is low compared to the high quality expensive brushes, but when I opened it up I was surprised how good the quality is. If you ask me, I would buy this again and recommend it to a friend! Even my sister fell in love with this brush which she is really picky about everything she buys.</li>
    <li> The quality is great for the price and it is great for blending liquid foundation if you want something close enough to a flawless look I would recommend This</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this brush but it turned out to be a great brush and at a great price! I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This brush arrived much earlier than expected which was a nice surprise.  The quality is excellent.  EXACTLY like the Sigma F80 brush that sells for more.  Very soft...not one hair on this brush has fallen out.  Would definitely purchase from Ailunce again-:)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a dupe for the Sigma F80 brush. I should have just spent the money on a Sigma one. At first this one was fine, but as I used it, it became harder to clean and there would always be some make up still trapped in it. It was alright and did make my make up look very good, but after having a Sigma F80 (I bought two after this one), it just can&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, very recently my handle broke off and I just ended up throwing it out. If you can&#x27;t spend the money on Sigma, I&#x27;d recommend a Real Techniques stippling brush instead.</li>
    <li> I Love This makeup Brush!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush. Just as good as a sigma or Mac brush. Holds it shape very well, even after several cleanings.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup brush I have ever had! This brush is fabulous. I love, love, love it. i</li>
    <li> Great brush! Very close to the Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki. Blends liquid foundation beautifully. I would definitely recommend this brush to someone looking for a great brush but, are on a budget! Seller was very professional and followed up. Shipping was very fast arrived weeks before estimated date!</li>
    <li> great brush, high quality, a definite sigma dupe, arrived ahead of schedule, I have been using it for about a week now, blends foundation beautifully, doesnt fall apart when cleaned, has not shed at all, a great brush for a fraction of what a sigma f80 would cost. If you dont have this, GET IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! I will never use another for foundation!!! I have been using it for a week now and there hasn&#x27;t been one bristle fall out!  The price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> This brush is truly amazing.  So soft and dense.  I use it for powder and applying foundation.  It clean like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding from this brush, and I wish I had ordered more than one for such a low price.  Shipping took about a week but, that wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
    <li> Most amazing brush I&#x27;ve ever had! I use this everyday to apply my foundation, it&#x27;s amazingggg! So dense and leaves my skin looking flawless, everyone should have one!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush not expecting much out of it, as it was super affordable. But what I got was fantastic! It is super soft, somewhat dense but not super duper dense (that&#x27;s perfect for me to blend out my foundation, I hate when they&#x27;re super dense because it just moves it around), and it&#x27;s well made. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice brush to first dab on, then buff in foundation in.</li>
    <li> Like the sternness of this product. It feels on your skin that it really works. It hold the powder well and tip is soft</li>
    <li> Shipped little late and there&#x27;s no tracking number so that was kinda inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I was kinda worried about the brush because It&#x27;s not famous and I&#x27;d never used before.&lt;br /&gt;But maybe I overworried.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, brush is very soft and looks great so I like it.</li>
    <li> First, I took a few stars off for the frustrating factors of having to wait a month to receive it! I&#x27;m definitely an instant gratification type.  Once I did get it, it&#x27;s a good brush. No shedding, and seems to blend makeup well.</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot. It works better with applying light make-up like my bb cream or some light liquid foundation, but I find with heavy foundation, it takes a longer time to blend everything well. But I liked it. And it arrived early which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin itchy and makes my sink feel like it has been rubbed raw.&lt;br /&gt;Has anybody else felt this or just me?&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like it. Threw it away. Not worth a penny.</li>
    <li> :( sorry to write that but i receive it DAMGE its broken from the handle .&lt;br /&gt;poor Quality</li>
    <li> Does not shed at all. Received a lot of compliments when I did my makeup with this brush.</li>
    <li> Just recieved it today , havent tried it yet , but let me tell you , its SUPER soft &amp; lovely :)</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for blending. Really soft but did come apart after a few weeks. I think I will glue it together again since it does work so well.</li>
    <li> Great brush and softer than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Got this in way earlier then expected haven&#x27;t used it yet but it feels so soft the bristles look like good quality I like it :)</li>
    <li> I own two of the Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brushes and I have to say this brush comes close! It is not quite as dense, but the bristles are so soft that I truly have no complaints. Shipping was FAST- much sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> Great quality for a good price and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft, and has no hair fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> This brush is a must for applying foundation! I even received it earlier then my expected delivery date! This brush is so soft but yet firm enough to apply foundation!!! It is made of synthetic hair which is great because it will allow your foundation to go on easier and wont get all trapped in the bristles of the hair! I also washed it for the first time and it had no shedding! I will definitely be buying more brushes from this company!!!</li>
    <li> It is soft, I thought it would have more of a sturdy feel, but I actually prefer how flexible it is.  My makeup blends well, great product.</li>
    <li> I use this to put on my foundation and it makes my makeup looks flawless. I will never use a beauty blender again!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even washed it yet because the smell is so strong. Not sure I want to deal with this issue again. I bought another brush that is &amp;#34;angled&amp;#34; and similar to this one and they both arrived with the same odor. I washed the other one so much and have even sucked it up and used it and it still stinks, and is now making all of my other brushes smell the same way. I might just throw this away.</li>
    <li> I had previously bought an expensive brand name flat top kabuki brush. I was in love with it until it began shedding. I wanted to replace it but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to have it shed so I tried this cheaper version. let me just say, it&#x27;s just as good and does not shed. I would buy this brush again before the brand name.</li>
    <li> I think its works very well for the price you are paying. Its very soft and the coverage is great!! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This bursh is excellent, I&#x27;m a MUA and use this one for foundation. Also my girls learning how to apply makeup use them and definitely love it!</li>
    <li> It was awesome! It blended my foundation very good.&lt;br /&gt;But after a couple of days using it.. this brush gave me a little bit or a lot of streaks. it usually gets covered with my setting powder but who likes streaky foundation? It does what its supposed to do when it&#x27;s clean but not as good as the first time you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this for a liquid foundation. I would recommend using this if your foundation is in powder form (mineral foundation) otherwise, its not as blended as it should be.</li>
    <li> Amazing I got these brushes about eight months ago and I still think it&#x27;s amazing doesn&#x27;t shed at all very soft and dence definetely worth buying specially since it is almost identical to my mac flat top brush</li>
    <li> Loved this brush until it strarted to shed and then the whole brush broke. I only had it for 2 weeks. Amazing brush if it were glued on right.</li>
    <li> Such a great price for what good quality it is.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> its ok. not better than Sonia Kashuk brushes from Target though.</li>
    <li> For like, $5, and with free shipping, you can&#x27;t go wrong! I&#x27;ve been using my brush every day, and have no issues with it....the bristles are not rough, they don&#x27;t fall out....you totally can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s cheaper than anything at a drugstore! Love mine---great for applying and blending my lightweight foundation each day---would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft and works well. Sadly, after only having it a couple weeks, the metal part broke off the wooden part. So now I just have the metal part. I guess if you want better quality you might wanna pay a little more. The actual brush part is great, it just sucks that it broke off.</li>
    <li> I must say that I absolutely love this brush! I have many brushes that I have tried to apply my liquid foundation and nothing compares to this brush (compared to drugstore brushes). But it works well, my foundation goes on light and it blends great. The soft bristles don&#x27;t fall out like other brushes I have tried. I would definitely recommend this product. Plus it came a lot earlier than I had expected!</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t believe cause of the price but it&#x27;s very worth it and I washed mine and still doing okay. I had it since spring.</li>
    <li> Very good product, but took a month to receive</li>
    <li> I LOVE AILUNCE BRUSHES! THIS BRUSH IS BETTER THEN MY SIGMA F80:) - beauty blogger</li>
    <li> It was nice at first, but then the hairs in the brushes started to come out as I used it. I actually stopped using it a few weeks after I bought it because I was afraid the whole thing would start to come out.</li>
    <li> It was a very tiny brush and left streak on my face. But it was just as discribed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush. Its so soft and its the perfect size. I definitely see a difference in the way my makeup looks when I apple foundation on my face using the &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;blending&amp;#34; method. This brush is LIFE!! :D</li>
    <li> Wow.. It got here today after 5 days and I am obsessed, this brush&lt;br /&gt;Is perfect it doesn&#x27;t smell like a lot of brushes do and it blends ny&lt;br /&gt;Foundation perfectly. And the price is just so convenient .&lt;br /&gt;I love it don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive brushes this is as&lt;br /&gt;Good as the 30$ ones! ;)</li>
    <li> love this brush works great, it feels so soft. it feels like  high end brush. would recommend this brush to anyone on a budget you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Excellent I love it. ..</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best foundation brush I have ever bought. My makeup goes on so evenly and at a fraction of the time. If you&#x27;re thinking of getting this brush just get it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> First off, it arrived extremely fast. Do not get thrown off by the arrival dates they provide you with. Arrived in excellent packaging! Not to mention the incredibly soft bristles. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and cannot wait to use it! :-)</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I expected but I was afraid it was going to be too small. The blending is impeccable.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who does professional make up, or is just a beginner. Ailunce gave free shipping on an already great deal for a make up brush. I was a little discouraged when I saw how far out the estimated delivery was. However, the brush arrived almost two weeks earlier than estimated. I was very pleased with my experience with this company and brush and I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Ive been looking all over for one this size, and it came in 2 weeks earlier than i expected. It&#x27;s so soft but the density of the brush makes it perfect for applying foundation :) If you&#x27;re wondering whether you should get it, have no fear! Lol.</li>
    <li> I was never a brush foundation chica...but this is wonderful...why did it take me soooo long. I love the even tone i get from it...definitely buy this one and don&#x27;t waste money on expensive ones...this one rocks!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. It&#x27;s soft and it blends my foundation so much better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Shipped without a problem.</li>
    <li> The shipping: The shipping for this product takes a while because this actually comes from China. It took around three weeks for it to get to my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging: I didn&#x27;t really like how this was packaged. It was just an open brush with a plastic slip over it. I recommend washing the brush before you use it because you never know who&#x27;s handled it and what was on their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush: Now, I&#x27;m not a make-up artist so I&#x27;m not very good at using this brush. I need practice. But when I did use the brush with my liquid foundation, it blended really nice. I just used too much foundation. The brush evenly spread out the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This is a very good brush for a very good price, but not too sure about the company.</li>
    <li> Decent brush for the price similar to the Sigma flattop kabuki brush. Easy foundation application makes the job faster. Would re-purchase</li>
    <li> I use this every day and love it&lt;br /&gt;Came on time,&lt;br /&gt;Works very well with liquid foundations and is great for blush as well</li>
    <li> When I took it out  the box the handle smelled like spray paint, I think it was hand made but it&#x27;s a nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;I barely use it.</li>
    <li> Take a chance and get this flat top kabuki brush! I&#x27;m so glad I risked a couple bucks, wow! I mainly use this blush to apply and do a final blend on foundation or to add powder. It works like a dream! I was super skeptical, but no hairs have come out, it&#x27;s soft, but perfectly dense.... I hate to say it but it&#x27;s better than my real Techniques - I use this every day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived, I was super skeptical, the hairs or fibers had a shine kind of like cheaper wigs, but I guess that has no impact on how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding shipping - my brush arrived before the estimated date and safely bundled up, so I don&#x27;t know how the seller expedited shipping, but I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I paid four bucks and forty-four cents for this. I know prices fluctuate for unknown reasons on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, get it!</li>
    <li> Love the way it performs.</li>
    <li> This Brush came on time, as was scheduled, the Brush is very soft. I&#x27;ve been using it almost on a daily day now for almost two weeks, DEFINATELY a good buy.</li>
    <li> It came on time and was very soft. I used it on my foundation but it just didn&#x27;t work for me (not because of the product, because of my face). Some brushes don&#x27;t work well cause it flakes my face, but that&#x27;s totally cause of me. The brush was great otherwise and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, when you first feel it you think that because its so soft that it won&#x27;t be good for buffing in foundation. But its amazing, its dense and really gets the job done.</li>
    <li> So soft!  The brush puts foundation on very smoothly and evenly.  Great value...can&#x27;t believe I got this quality for the price!</li>
    <li> This brush works so good. Its very cheap too, and the arrival time is awesome i got it the next week which is amazing, don&#x27;t be fooled with the dates they give you, would definitely buy another one :)</li>
    <li> Good brush worked well. Arrived on time in great condition. No problems with brush or how it arrived. Look forward to future purchases</li>
    <li> The woman I ordered it for hasn&#x27;t stopped talking about how great this brush is.  All I know is she looks beautiful but I always thought she did anyway.</li>
    <li> Wow this brush is a  MUST !!!! I couldnt wait to receive it and it came way early from its delivery date which was a plus ! This brush felt like heaven it glides smoothly on the face when applying foundation. This brush took my breath away and the price was amazing too ! Looking forward to buying more :) !</li>
    <li> it works so well and have washed it so many times and it still feels so soft and maintains shape and no shedding! whoop whoop!</li>
    <li> Was looking for an inexpensive flat top kabuki brush and cane across this one. It is extremely inexpensive compared to name brand ones. The brush works great, one of my main concerns when purchasing it was if it would shed. I read the reviews and they were overall very positive so I decided to try it. Well there has been NO shedding whatsoever, and it blends out my makeup perfectly. I like using with my nyx stay matte but not flat liquid foundation. The end result is flawless. Will definitely purchase again if I have to and will recommend!</li>
    <li> Very soft, very good quality for under 10 bucks. Dupe for Sigma flat top kabuki F80. Definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> About this brush. It is a VERY nice brush for the price that I paid, however I was definitely expecting something a little different. Its very soft and fluffy and what I am looking for in a foundation brush is something a little more dense. Maybe with firmer bristles that don&#x27;t tend to flatten when buffing. This compared to the Sigma F80 brush is completely different. If you&#x27;re looking for a dupe, this is not the brush to go for. But if you aren&#x27;t as picky as me, this brush will give you what you need.</li>
    <li> Package arrived sooner than I expected. The brush looks exactly as it does in the Photo and is very dense and soft. I&#x27;m very happy with the product thus far. The bristles haven&#x27;t shed and In my opinion its just as good or better than the Sigma Version.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product arrived on time and in the condition described. I believe it was a great price for the product. I&#x27;ve tried several brushes and the texture is amazing on this one. I did have to speak with the vendor and they were great to work with. They responded in a timely manner and were very kind and professional. I will be ordering more products from them If I need to in the future.</li>
    <li> the brush arrived before time and was packaged reallt nice. i really like the durablity of the brush it so soft and dense enough for me i couldnt give it 5 stars yet cause i havent used i have washed it and no hairs fell out still looks and feels good. cant wait to use it for the price you cant beat this.</li>
    <li> I Love this brush to blend out my foundation, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy and havent had any hair fallouts.</li>
    <li> Soooo soft and very nice quality!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush only if it&#x27;s Ailunce . I had one that I lost so I bought another one,but this one I bought from a different seller who sent me the fake one... So beware of those sellers.</li>
    <li> I received this brush, I had never used one before.  Simply amazed at the quality and just so amazingly soft but firm.  Very good quality for the price.  The company Ailunce sent me a personal email thanking me for purchasing their product, which shows to me they care about its customers and ensuring their satisfaction.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> the brush is really soft yet strong and durable definitely worth spending your money on....  very good quality absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Best one I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
    <li> This brush works just as good as any high end brush. It was well worth the wait of getting to me and I love it. I will keep buying this brush for sure and recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these at a good price and this met my expectations beautifully. As long as you wash it once every 2 weeks or so, you can tell how awesome it is.</li>
    <li> Looks nice and all and affordable.. Only problem is that mine never got delivered!!!! Four months now and nothing maybe more! Not happy.!</li>
    <li> I DID LIKE IT AT FIRST, IT IS VERY SOFT, AND DOES APPLY PERFECTLY, BUT, OF COURSE, ONCE YOU WASH IT, IT STARTS TO SHED, AND MY BRUSH CAME APART, I NOTICED THAT THEY USED LITTLE, VERY LITTLE HOT GLUE TO ATTACH BOTH PIECES, NO REASON WHY IT IS SO CHEAP. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS, REMEMBER, AFTER YOU DEEP CLEAN IT, IT WILL SHED AND MAY EVEN COME APART, SO I BOUGHT THIS SAME KABUKI BUT AT TARGET, $9 BUT WORKS WAY BETTER, AND DOES NOT SHED ON MY FACE LIKE THIS ONE! NOTE TO SELLER: PLACE THE BRISTLES BETTER, AND APPLY MORE HOT GLUE!!</li>
    <li> Just like the sigma F180 but just a thousand times cheaper lol. Great for blending in foundation. Fast Shipping  Excellent product. A+++</li>
    <li> Very soft, blends make up well, cleans easily and feels good in hand.  Just an overall good brush for the price.</li>
    <li> In looooove! Great brush! Exactly what i was looking for! Bristles stay in place. For the price i paid, works amazing! Ordering another one soon!</li>
    <li> Wow, soft bristles, very professional! I have some expensive brushes that are nothing compared to this. Perfect for flawless foundation application. Thank you for a good price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great quality for the price, shipping was quicker than expected, one or two bristles did shed at first but other than that would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like wearing makeup, especially foundation. However, I have acne, so I need coverage. This makes blending my foundation and my liquid concealer so much easier. I don&#x27;t lose coverage and the brush doesn&#x27;t pick up too much of the product. I love this thing! The bristles are so soft and dense. I use much less product since I&#x27;ve bought this brush.</li>
    <li> Judging from the price of this brush i wasnt expecting anything great. But i loved it. Use it everyday, even foundation coverage, and easy to clean the brush. Love love love it</li>
    <li> got this to use for applying skincare masks evenly.  i would not use it for clay masks, but for creme/moisturizing masks, it works well and helps evenly distribute product in a thin layer.  the bristles are super soft, the handle has a beautiful finish that makes handling easy and natural, and the brush is well balanced overall with good weight distribution.  i also find it easy to clean using a little bit of face cleanser and warm water.</li>
    <li> Innnn loooveee!! Dont freak out about the delivery estimate it doesnt really take that long. I receive mine christmas eve and I order it almost 9 days before. This brush is so high end quality for its price. Please dont skip this buy, buy ittt!! You will love it!!</li>
    <li> BRUSH IS NICE AND SOFT BUT HANDLE CAME OFF TWICE AND I HAD TO REGLUE...OTHER THAN THAT FOR THE PRICE THE QUALITY IS GOOD!</li>
    <li> Would recommend this brush to anyone! It&#x27;s soft, useful, and the brush doesn&#x27;t fall apart like most brushes I have been buying.</li>
    <li> Love the brush. It is exactly what I was looking for.  The bristles don&#x27;t shed and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes but this makes my makeup application quite easier ... Smooth finish &amp; gives great coverage</li>
    <li> I use this daily to buff in liquid foundation and it is absolutely wonderful, and also arrived early! would recommend.</li>
    <li> Can compare to high end! I think it&#x27;s the same as the sigma.. A must have! Really the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve used so far.. Gives a really nice application</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels and how it leaves my foundation. Its better than the one i used before</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my cream make up and it works really great.  I need to order another one to have on hand so I can wash one and use the other.  Worth having.</li>
    <li> I like how when I wash it the brissles don&#x27;t come off because I have brushes like this and the hairs come off but if you like brushes like these and you need a new one BUY THIS ONE! ;)</li>
    <li> Brush is very soft.Works great.Looks just like the sigma.the shipping was faster than what was stated..Would definitely buy again.thanks you.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it&#x27;s amazing and I am a makeup brush addict, I am so glad I went ahead and purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to apply my liquid foundation, it blends like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase all the other brushes now as well, not to mention I received this item very fast !!!</li>
    <li> I loveee this brush. And come on for the price u can&#x27;t beat that. I owned Mac brushes and ever since I got this brush I don&#x27;t use my Mac brushes</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I ordered two one for liquid and one for powder foundation. Applies liquid foundation without streaks and packs on lots of powder (Which is what I wanted). The only bad part is hair fall out. But its not too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a complete newbie when it come to makeup brushes, so I order at his brush because it was close to the one my friend uses and I absolute love it. I uses it all. the time it&#x27;s much better then my fingers and I feel my skin looks nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Bought a similar brush from a name brand at target for $17. My sister wanted one as well but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on a makeup brush. I bought this for her. It&#x27;s quality matched my much more expensive brush. Great purchase</li>
    <li> I used it for a couple days and the top of the brush broke. Very cheap and do not like. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I only used it once so far...and the one use I was in awwww......after a few more uses I&#x27;ll update my review but it shipped faster than expected</li>
    <li> Used this brush for the first time today and it blended out my foundation perfectly! No streaking or anything! Its a very soft brush with a good amount of density! The price makes this brush a real winner too.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best one that I&#x27;ve used for liquid foundation.  It blends amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;A con that some people might notice is that the top hairs are slightly purple.. I don&#x27;t know if it was just my brush but that hasn&#x27;t been said by any other reviewers.  Also, the brush came out smelling a little like paint or something like that.  It didn&#x27;t make a difference to me, though, I wash all my new brushes before I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: My brush started to shed a little about 2 weeks after I purchased it.  It still continues to shed more frequently and in larger quantities.  It might be my fault because so many people said it never shed for them, but I don&#x27;t see how. I wash it very often and gently and I dry it upside down so the water doesn&#x27;t get in the ferrule and loosen the hairs.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face too roughly.  I&#x27;m going to repurchase this to see if the second one will do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The brush now has completely pushed inside itself... It&#x27;s unusable.  I might repurchase it but I&#x27;m not sure I want to go through the trouble.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how much I paid for the brush, but it wasn&#x27;t very much. I just received it today, after ordering it weeks ago. Since it is sent from China, I expected the long wait. I opened it immediately, surprised by how wonderful the brush it. Since it&#x27;s synthetic, I expected the feel to be rough, but its very soft. I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush twice, the price was unbeatable and the quality is great. I&#x27;ve had no shedding, cleans well, buffs in foundation with no effort at all. Much better than drugstore brushes in quality at a fraction of the price. Shipping has been relatively quick for an overseas order, never longer than 3 weeks from order to delivery and packaged well. I would (and probably will) repurchase this brush.</li>
    <li> Love it. It blends my make up so well. I would recommend this to anybody.  I going to try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  My Kabuki brush smooths out my foundation with great blending and without all the mess on my fingers. It makes my makup look natural.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles. Perfect brush size. Spreads makeup evenly throughout. Nice stippling brush. Ty amazon and aulience. Very satisfied. 😊</li>
    <li> i love love love this brush...love it so much i use it for everything. i cant believe i got it for this price. only down part is that it took forever to get it. the wait was worth it tho.. def a must need. i will order again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying the sigma one this does exactly the same thing for half the money , I love this foundation brush it applies liquid foundation or bb creams perfectly</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this brush because I read so many good reviews about it. I have to say, the only bad thing about it is that it feels really flimsy BUT it still does it&#x27;s job. Best brush I&#x27;ve used so far. And it does a tremendous job in flawlessly applying my foundation. I&#x27;ve had many people ask me what I&#x27;m doing different because it almost looks like I&#x27;m not wearing foundation at all. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!  Perfect brush for applying foundation.  Dense and really soft bristles, and  hasn&#x27;t shed at all.  It did take a while to ship, but definitely worth the wait!</li>
    <li> This brush is great..feels nice and smooth and blends makeup wonderfully . Although it has a smell of nail polish but I guess that&#x27;s something which will be taken care of when washed !</li>
    <li> I really like this brush as it is VERY affordable and helps me apply my bb cream much more evenly! It is so soft and durable. I highly recommend it.:)</li>
    <li> I bought this because its a dupe of the Sigma f80. I love this brush! Does wonders with my foundation :) . Only down side was it took awhile to get here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and it came about a week or so earlier than expected. The brush handle is quite thick and a little bulky but other than that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> The product is a good price for this brush. It does shed some hair but it maintains the shape. It was soft and easy to use in applying foundation and BB cream. It gives an even coverage on application. I will repurchase again in the future as this is a good product so far.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It took a long time for it to arrive, but the brissels are really soft and it works for applying coverage all over my face. It was worth the long wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year, and it is my go to brush. I have a million brushes but I always choose this one when it comes to stippling or blended, even liquid and thick cream concealers.</li>
    <li> this brush is horrible! all the brushes fell out on my face. what a waste of my monet. do not buy this brush</li>
    <li> The brush looks exactly how it is shown in the picture. It is soft to touch and can be used with liquid foundation. However, it took a very long time to come. I know it was coming from overseas but I was getting impatient. It took exactly 15 days to arrive.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. I love that it does not have fall-outs, it&#x27;s smooth, and most importantly, evens out my make-up application. I would recommend it. I should have bought about two or three just to keep (and because I get too lazy to clean it) but this is an amazing brush. They price is great too! Honestly, forget MAC brushes. I have spent money on them and the hairs fall out after washing it ONCE. This great stuff</li>
    <li> This is very soft and nice brush. I use this to blend my foundation it blends very nice and even . I have used so many other type of foundation brushes but this is the best . As a makeup artist I have to say I loved it .&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ll highly recommend this brush to everyone who is looking for best brush for best and affordable price.you won&#x27;t regret believe me.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this from\\&quot; Ailunce\\&quot; the shipping was fast and free which I loved it . And want to say thank you for making this to affordable for me and lot other people who can not afford some other brands since this is giving the same result. I&#x27;ll buy it again and of course from \\&quot;Ailunce\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Hey low price but works great I&#x27;ve had it for almost two years &amp;&amp; it&#x27;s great love this brush! It&#x27;s worth your money !</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Use it everyday! It gives me a nice, even, airbrush look to my liquid foundation. Easy to clean! I don&#x27;t know how I survived without it. I have purchased a 2nd one for a gift!</li>
    <li> I used to apply my foundation with my fingers but I&#x27;ve totally stopped.I love this brush !! Its super soft and a dupe for sigmas flattop ! And all the times ive washed it its never shedded definately a must have leaves such a flawless finish !</li>
    <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the price but I was pleasantly surprised. But, I must say that when I took it out of the package for the first time, the bristles were already falling out. Then i went to use it and I got coveredddd in bristles from the brush. I figured oh well it was so cheap anyways, but then i used it again and no bristles came out at all. And there hasn&#x27;t been one since then. So I&#x27;m not sure if I was lucky or if all of them are like that but I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and it works extreeeeemely well. Just had to get over the first time i used it and everything was good.</li>
    <li> This is my go to makeup brush for applying liquid foundation. I am glad I tried this out before splurging on a high end makeup brush when this one is fantastic and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I received my brush earlier then expected! It is a great quality brush. I have not used it yet but look forward to it. It is a heavier brush, which tells you that it is made well! It is also extremely soft! I absolutely LOVE it. I would definitely buy from this seller again!! :)</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day when applying my foundation and it gives a perfect application every time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new favorite brush, it is just what I expected and more am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I wanted a foundation brush and this is exactly what I was looking for!!! I use it for my powder foundation and it is so soft yet covers my face perfectly!! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> amazing product , soooo soft, my fav brushhh!!!! def something I would recommend and buy again! better than most name brand brushes ive used!</li>
    <li> Such a great brush! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  Good quality in my opinion. Thick, but not too thick.</li>
    <li> i bought this after reading that these are really helpful in applying foundation. the price was super affordable too. when i got the brush it was in perfect condition. the bristles on this brush are beyond soft. like seriously, i could rub it on my face all day kind of soft. it made applying my MAC compact foundation a million times easier, &amp; made it look a thousand times better too. i would recommend to anyone. it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Worth the wait in shipping time. Very inexpensive but good quality. I use this for stipling and blending foundation.  comparible to sigma or mac. Very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> I use this with Revlon Color Stay and it works amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for a brush like this. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other brushes for liquid foundation but this is the best. I&#x27;ll be honest and say I still use my fingers on my forehead especially in between my eye brows, but that&#x27;s kind of a hard place to get too and it&#x27;s really an important spot. Other than that, this is great! The wait was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Well first of all, I&#x27;d just like to point out that I received this package several weekends before it was expected, so I&#x27;m extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the product itself, it is quite thick (in the handle), and the actual brush itself is very soft. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it seems of very good quality :)</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s my favorite in my collection. Very soft to the face and easy to clean .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend!</li>
    <li> this is my best friend!&lt;br /&gt;works amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;loveit loveit loveit!&lt;br /&gt;my make up looks flawless!&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this to every girl:)</li>
    <li> I read many good reviews here on Amazon before purchasing this brush, but I was still skeptical because of the low price. But it really is excellent. The bristles are very soft. It does a wonderful job of blending. I use it every day. I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and it&#x27;s holding up just fine. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several friends and I plan on purchasing another one as a back up, just in case.</li>
    <li> I found my perfect blending brush!  I must order more!  I used it for the first time this morning, and I got my foundation on in  a fraction of the time.  This brush is soft and blends beautifully!</li>
    <li> came early and looks just like pictures. very soft bristles</li>
    <li> its so soft , i love it . makes my foundation look FLAWLESS! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used it yet except to sweep it over my face just to feel how soft it was.  I will say that the fibers are very sensitive and can be pulled out very very easily.  It may not hold up very long just from what I have noticed with it losing the fibers but like I said, I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I love it! I love that the brush doesn&#x27;t shed and leaves my makeup looking flawless. I was impressed that this product shipped amzingly fast! I received it about a week after ordering it.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for myself to apply my foundation and fell in love. I had to order another one. It blends any kind of make up so naturally! I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these make up brushes for my teenage daughters and they fell apart after a week of use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good quality works really well for liquid foundations.</li>
    <li> Love it! Applies my makeup wonderfully!!</li>
