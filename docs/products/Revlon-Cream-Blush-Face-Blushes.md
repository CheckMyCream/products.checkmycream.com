    <li> I LOVE this product and no one sells it here.</li>
    <li> Wrong color its a waste of money</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for cream blushes anyway but this was not good at all. This was greasy and did not show up on my nc 30-35 skin tone.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. So very sorry that it has been discontinued!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t understand why Revlon stopped making this product as it&#x27;s the best cream blush out there.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted at a great price.  I was not able to find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Sorry Revlon discontinued this product. New color are too orange. Yuk! I would like this color without the mirror too expensive.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace Revlon&#x27;s &amp;#34;First Blush&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t know the name at the time.  I will continue to look for this nearly-impossible- to- find product.</li>
    <li> So bummed that this has been discontinued. Wish Revlon would bring it back because it&#x27;s a great color for me.</li>
    <li> The blush is much lighter than the other two I previously purchased,</li>
    <li> My mom loves this product!</li>
    <li> Great Cream Blush. Color goes with everything. Can&#x27;t get it anywhere now -Revlon discontinued.</li>
    <li> Very good for coverage and a natural glow.</li>
    <li> Not the color shown, it is lighter.</li>
    <li> This is the only blush I&#x27;ve used for 10+ years! It goes on smoothly &amp; it&#x27;s not obvious that I&#x27;m wearing blush at all.</li>
    <li> Wish I could get this in my local stores ...love the fact that it is cream!  Color is perfect!  It looks so natural!</li>
    <li> Love this shade and the way it blends into your skin just enough to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why I can&#x27;t find it in the stores lately....</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the color and product</li>
    <li> Revlon no longer makes this shade.  too bad, because it is the best!</li>
    <li> Revlon is discontinuing this color and  cream blush.  Can&#x27;t live without it , so I purchased all I could find in my favorite color.</li>
    <li> I have used this for probably 10-15 years; but it&#x27;s getting hard to find. It lets your face color look real, rather than leaving a layer of colored powder. It also is very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I like this blush but my skin is a little too oily for it.  You may actually love it.  I just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> This blush is very creamy. Only problem is it is a light color and does not show up much. Try a different color.</li>
    <li> Barely visible on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> This was the only color and the only brand my mother used and she was extremely frustrated when she couldn&#x27;t find it. I told her that it could be found online...and it was! She was soooo happpy!</li>
    <li> Great product. I hate I can&#x27;t get it at our Walmart anymore. Better than what is out there now!</li>
    <li> I love this blush. Why can&#x27;t I find it in the stores anymore? Very creamy goes on smooth and blends in for a more natural look. This is the only color I like and very hard to find now, sadly. A great product for middle aged or older women as it brings a moist, healthy glow.</li>
    <li> My favorite color is no longer carried in any stores.  Bought two here.</li>
    <li> I have always used this product and love it.  It is so soft on the skin and gives me a rosy glow which is what I love.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully creamy blush!! I apply with a brush  and it blends beautifully!! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I read over the other reviews and chose this color because I didn&#x27;t want anything too dark or too pink...I wanted a rosy glow.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this blush disappeared on my skin. I kept adding more but honestly couldn&#x27;t see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium skin tone. This might work better on someone with very fair skin.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like powder blush, this is only shade I like so far and unfortunately it was no longer carried in my store, only can find online</li>
    <li> My local stores have stopped stocking this item.  Other blushes make me look like a clown! Thanks for making this available. As always, I was pleased with product quality and the prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for availability, but one star (wish I could give it a zero) for condition of the case:  FILTHY and badly scratched!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend.  This color has been discontinued by Revlon and is no longer carried in her local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products arrived very quickly after I ordered them and I am not even an Amazon Prime member.  They were very carefully packaged and arrived at their destination safe and sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, she was very surprised and pleased.  She has been using this color for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon, for making her very happy and for your superb service.</li>
    <li> It really does give a rosy glow -- couldn&#x27;t find it locally as I usually do and creme blushes are much better on someone my age so I took a chance and ordered it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blush for a long time. I was very upset when I learned that Revlon has discontinued it. I tried another brand which didn&#x27;t work nearly as well for me. I hope Revlon will come out with something very similar.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives a natural glow to my face without looking over done.  It is not a heavy color and blends well with my skin</li>
    <li> I love this blush.  It&#x27;s the perfect shade for blondes like me.  It looks natural and goes on easily.  It is one of my must-haves.</li>
    <li> Beautiful rouge. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> After much trial and error, I finally found a blush that works well for me. This cream blush blends very well with my foundation, and it is easy to apply.  Originally, I was able to purchase it wherever Revlon products were sold.  However, recently It was nowhere to be found in cosmetic departments.  I was overjoyed to find it online!</li>
    <li> Excellent look...so natural and it doesn&#x27;t flake off like powdered rouge.</li>
    <li> The customer service was great and the product was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you  so much.</li>
    <li> Love revlon cream blush but this color is too light.</li>
    <li> exactly as pictured - great product</li>
    <li> Cream blush is the way to go - most cosmeticians are using it today in their salons. This color&lt;br /&gt;is good for almost anyone - it is neither dark nor too light.  The product does not &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; and is not&lt;br /&gt;greasy.  The little mirror is nice to use when traveling or out of the house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and was so disappointed not to find it in any stores. Hope you keep it in stock...</li>
    <li> I love this blush and have used it for years. Perfect for my skin tone</li>
