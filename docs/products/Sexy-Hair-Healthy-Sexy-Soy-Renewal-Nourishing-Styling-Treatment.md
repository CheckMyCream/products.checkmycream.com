<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it, it smells good. I have very thin hair so I wanted something light for my hair. To many products weigh it down. But to be honest it really don&#x27;t do much to my hair :-/ my hair still frizzes up. maybe its just not meant for thin, wavy hair. But I will say that it smells really good.</li>
    <li> The bottle had broke open so when I opened the package the product had leaked out.</li>
    <li> Better price than the Salon and same great product. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time at a salon for $20.  It is the best when you use it when your hair is damp or dry.  When your hair is wet, it doesn&#x27;t give the same shine.  I have dyed my hair for 30 years (since I was 16). So it is dry and brittle looking.  WIth this stuff, it looks smooth and silky!  Ii just love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well on just dried hair. Smells amazing</li>
    <li> I have fine frizzy hair but lots of it.  I found this product along with the Silky Sexy Hair conditioner really smooths my hair, even during rainy days.  I use probably three times the recommended amount, but it never makes my style flat.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and silky, I have dry, thick color treated hair.  Works great, just need to take the time to really rub it in.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past several months, not only does it make my hair softer, but it also cuts down my blow drying time nearly in half! I have really long hair that tends to fry easily, and this has not only helped my hair become healthier, but it seems to really protect it too. I have gotten it for almost every woman in my family and I would recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> I received a small sample from Ulta recently and can&#x27;t believe what a difference its made on my fine, very curly, frizzy hair.  Just applying a small amount before blow drying (I blow dry straight and flat-iron every day) keeps the frizzies away all day long, even in these hot humid days of summer.  Also, my hair feels soft and silky all day as well.  I&#x27;ve never been able to describe my hair as silky or shiny before this, and I&#x27;ve used many, many products (even some that were very expensive)for easing frizz or smoothing during heat styling.  I&#x27;m getting more right away and giving it to my twin sister who struggles with the same unmanageable hair as me.</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic. The bottle is TERRIBLE. It leaks everywhere. I travel a lot and I cannot travel with it. I&#x27;m thinking about switching brands just so I can travel with it. But I really like this product and don&#x27;t want to have to do that. What a bummer. I wish the manufacturer would fix this already. Seems like an easy fix but it is sooooo annoying. I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and they have all leaked like this.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. After i put it in my hair, i never have to worry about friz. It will even last after straightening your hair or blow drying it. awesome product that&#x27;s why I bought two bottles, and you only need a drop the size of a dime.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel super soft and shiny and it helps dry my hair very quick!</li>
    <li> Oh My Gosh!!!!  This product is absolutely incredible!!!! The best best best serum I  have ever used.  Not greasy, it makes my hair look amazing. Healthy, super soft, with a nice natural sheen.   I am hooked!!</li>
    <li> This product beats the competition hands down... It&#x27;s fantastic! Because of it&#x27;s affordability it slips by the others.(moroccanoil.) This is the way to go you won&#x27;t be disappointed...Another perk,that I have noticed, in the mornings after I have used this product, my hair isn&#x27;t messed up, it&#x27;s almost as if this product keeps you hair in shape while you sleep! \\&quot;Honest\\&quot; I don&#x27;t get it, I know I LOVE it,a must have for me! (my hair is med length)I should add My Husband uses it as well, he has naturally curly hair it tames his hair and makes it shiny....He&#x27;s a guys guy and LOVES it as much as I do.: )</li>
    <li> First experienced Sexy Hair Soy Renewal at the local JC Penney salon when my daughter had a trim and flat iron style. The stylist used the Soy Treatment and it brought amazing protection, and shine to her long hair. Left hair manageable without looking or feeling coated with product. Very light and natural texture and feeling left behind. Highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before and not a problem. This time it had leaked out all over the box and my other item purchase. Exactly what I wanted quick delivery. Just lost quite a bit of product from it leaking 😕</li>
    <li> After using Sexy hair styling treatment, I can honestly say it was an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; experience.  I have always been faithful &amp; used Lancome dry treatment for damaged tips; however, naturally, it is no longer sold.  Sexy hair left my hair soft.  Being that I have long hair, it took quite a bit of the product even with concentrating on the ends.  As far as it holding style, forget that.  This product only seemed to slightly soften, not hold style in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have always been very low maintenance with my hair, and I usually don&#x27;t use products other than shampoo or conditioner.  I got a free sample of HealthySexyHair Soy Renewal, and I am a convert!  Ha.  But seriously, I love how smooth and soft it makes my hair -- I usually put it in while my hair is still wet, and it eliminates the need to blow-dry because there is no crazy frizz (my hair is really thick).</li>
    <li> I was getting a haircut and my stylist used this on my hair as a finisher.  The oil made my hair feel really soft and it looked well hydrated so I bought a bottle for myself.  This works great on kinky/curly hair.</li>
    <li> Last week I went up to the mall with my boyfriend to get his hair cut, and in the salon I saw this product on the front desk. It was pretty cheap, and I love soy products so I decided to give it a shot! I have long thin curly frizzy hair naturally but I straighten it. It was taking me 20+ minutes before to dry my hair, now its about 10. It leaves my hair so soft and smooth, its amazing! Totally reccomend!</li>
    <li> I have colored and highlighted hair, spend untold hours in the sun/pool and dry/flat iron my hair daily.  I use this product every time I wash my hair.  It does not weigh it down, but keeps it very healthy even with all the abuse I give it.  Would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I brought this at a local store for 20 bucks because my hair is very dry and fizzy.  Just a drop will do..and.. so it WILL last for a very long time. I love the smell too of the product. This is something I have to be careful with as far as hair treatment goes because I am very sensitive and get headache from the smell ...this one I DO NOT get a headache with. Five Stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!!! I&#x27;ve tried alot of different products to help with frizz and they didn&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job as this does!! It keeps ur hair super soft and it really does help dry it faster!!! Great deal! Won&#x27;t go to anything else!!!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no question this stuff works great, but has anyone else noticed a leaky bottle! I am on my 10 bottle and every one has leaked through the lid! When ayanding in the cabnet ita fine but It sucks for traveling! SOMEONE PLEASE FIX THIS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long naturally curly thin hair that is very sensitive to humidity changes. It frizzes easily and up till now I&#x27;ve had to use a lot of strong hair spray to keep it curly. I wasn&#x27;t that I was concerned about keeping it \\&quot;in place\\&quot;...but the hair spray was the only way to keep the curls ..\\&quot;curly\\&quot;. Unfortunately It was crunchy too....which I hated.  Other products made my hair greasy and waxy and I hated that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally... The girl that cuts my hair recommended this product, and I tried it.  Low and behold IT WORKS WONDERFULLY! ..I&#x27;m hooked.  I do use about two or three times as much as recommended, but even still....there&#x27;s no residue.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  It&#x27;s actually very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that gets dried out easily.  I put this product every once and a while on the ends of my hair and it makes my hair feel AMAZINGLY SOFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> If you or your wife needs help with calming frizzy hair or just keeping/getting it smooth, then you need to try this product.  Ever since my wife tried this the first time, it became a staple in our bathroom.  If it runs out, we&#x27;re looking for more.</li>
    <li> This product has quickly become my MUST have.  My hair gets dry and tangled due to it&#x27;s having been colored and the fact that it is mid-back in length.  This product is incredible.  I apply it to my damp hair before combing and not only does it make it easier to comb through, but it smells and shines like you cannot believe.  I LOVE this stuff.  Don&#x27;t know how my hair lived without it.  ;)</li>
    <li> I have dry over-processed hair from years of highlighting. This product makes my hair feel very silky but not weighted down. I apply it before blow drying and it actually speeds up the drying time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and my hair has never looked better!  I went from have dry lifeless curls to having shiny, healthy hair.  I don&#x27;t even need to use any other styling products with it.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is trying to go the natural route or just wants their hair to look like it did pre-products :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff for dry hair. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have long and very thick hair - It takes FOREVER to blow dry, it&#x27;s frizzy and it&#x27;s an all-around pain in the butt sometimes. To give you an idea of how thick it is, it takes 2-3 hairties to keep my hair in a ponytail w/o it slipping. I&#x27;ve got a beast of a mane.     This stuff has been amazing. My hair is smooth and soft. It feels very healthy and moisturized. I really couldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff more. Plus, my blow-drying time has been cut in half. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> My friend put me on to this product  and I really like it. My hair has a wonderful shine to it with just a drop.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My favorite for my curly hair. It defines the curls and is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I got this from my hairdresser / good friend. She got it as a sample and asked me to try it. I&#x27;ve used it ever since and just bought more. I have very fine, very thin hair and it is hard to find products that work without weighing it down. This stuff makes my hair shiny and gives it volume. Just a dime size in my palm works wonders.</li>
    <li> Hair feels great, and it smells so good. My daughter has 3C/4A type hair and I&#x27;m still trying to save it from breakage, but our new oil infused regimen is giving positive results.</li>
    <li> I have very thin curly hair, my daughter has pretty thick wavy hair.  My hair is no longer falling out and this product keeps it frizz free in humidity.  My round brush no longer gets caught up in my hair, just glides through.  My daughter never wanted me to comb her hair due to tangles despite trying numerous different tangle free products.  We now call this the magic...she no longer argues over combing her hair, just wants to be sure I up in the magic first.  Best hair product I have ever used, promise!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this treatment off/on for the past several years.  One bottle lasts forever because you can use so little and still get outstanding results!  It makes your hair soft, shiny, and smooth.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have naturally VERY oily &amp; thick hair and have hated ALL hair spray/gel product because it made my head feel like a nasty oily sweaty mess!! A stylist suggested this product and I love it!! One must use a very small amount &amp; left my pre-chemo hair soft, shiny and in place.  Yea!&lt;br /&gt;Since completing chemo in mid February my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hair is still oily but now curly/wavy and becomes frizzy with the Midwest summer humidity. This product smooths out the frizz and still leaves my head feeling &#x27;light&#x27; not bogged down with a lot of product!! I do need a bit more now, to keep the frizzes in control.</li>
    <li> The soy oil helps my hair stay fresh and soft all day. Also helps my hair not become too dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  Pul a drop or two in with your conditioner and mix in the palm of your hand your hair is so soft. It also reduces frizz with out weighing your hair down and adding a natural shine.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST product I have ever used in my hair! It makes it shiny, smooth and so touchable! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This controls my dry hair without weighing it down. The product also smells great. I bought three and will be buying more. Amazon was half the price of my salon.</li>
    <li> i buy this for my salon 21.00 $ this is amazing price and always the healthy sexy hair wonderful stuff&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My daughter is half black and she absalutly loves this stuff. I even put it in my hair before i staighten it.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have super frizzy hair around the crown of my head. If you apply while your hair is still damp and work it into the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; it does the trick. Once my hair air drys, I flat iron and my hair stays straight until I wash it again. In a few days you will begin to notice a difference in the way your hair feels. Mine has become super soft since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and this was recommended to me by a hair stylist and it really helps protect my hair from the heat styling I do. Flat irons, blow dryer, curling irons... etc. It makes my hair more manageable and keeps it looking healthy. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use a flat iron everyday and I use just a dime size amount before I flat iron.  My hair is super soft and shiny.  I paid $19.95 at the hairdresser for this 4.2 size.</li>
    <li> great product. I use this product faithfully!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for damaged hair from too much flat ironing.  I like to leave it in as I sleep and wash it out in the morning.  great hair tonic.  I like to put it on my hair while its damp. Will not leave your hair oily if you use as directed.</li>
    <li> I love this styling treatment! I have very thick hair + have tried every hair serum out there + this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with. A little goes a long way + makes my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> My hair is super soft and healthy without being greasy</li>
    <li> I found this product about 3 months ago and have used it every time I wash my hair since! A very small amount leaves my very thick, long, curly hair tangle free, faster to blow dry, shiny, frizz free, and extremely soft. The more I use it the healthier my hair becomes. I would recommend this product to everyone, it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have thick, waist-length hair, prone to frizz. Not curly, not straight. I&#x27;ve tried different smoothing products and serums in the past, but nothing has come close to this one. I did have my doubts when I saw that the size was 4.2 oz. And it seemed small when it came in the package. But I quickly found that all I need is a dime-sized dollop. This will last me quite a while. And really, I have no complaints. It makes my hair feel smooth, it eliminates more of the frizz than I&#x27;ve seen with other products. It also smells wonderful! Not too overpowering either.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey. But I&#x27;ve just gone through so many kinds of products, that its a total relief to finally come across one that works well. I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit more. I would recommend it to anyone with dry or frizz-prone hair. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair stylist puts in on my hair everytime i get it done so the last time i looked at the label and had to get on and get me some. It leaves your hair shiny and soft!!!!</li>
    <li> Have tried all of the &amp;#34;Sexy&amp;#34; hair products and they never fail to impress -This is great!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I have been using this oil for a few years.  It keeps my hair detangled and moisturized. I rarely use a comb, just this oil and my fingers.  I believe using this oil has helped my keep my long hair from getting too thin.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff and it proved hard to find except on Amazon, and at a price lower than she expected. It makes her hair smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It leaves my hair silky smooth. It really helps fight the frizzies.  I highly reccommed this product.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this stuff. Silky smooth and dry in no time at all- my mane is under control. The wonderful clean smell is an added bonus! Great stuff especially if you have thick hair!</li>
    <li> this is the third product i buy it from sexy hair, OMG it is amazing i love it soooo much my hair became more smoother shiny healthy and definitely sexy :P. i order this treatment and the leave in conditioner as a present for my sister birthday and she love love love it .&lt;br /&gt;thanks sexy hair you are the best :)</li>
    <li> Summed up: this stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I&#x27;ve never spent much on hair products. But I saw this at the drug store and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I have long, thick hair, that&#x27;s kinda prone to breakage, and my dad&#x27;s curly hair and mom&#x27;s silky-straight hair combined to give me hair that is frizzy half the time, and oily-looking the other half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my method:&lt;br /&gt;After shower (shampoo 2x with Aussie, no conditioner [my hair gets too oily w/ conditioner]) I&#x27;ll comb my hair out, towel dry, comb again, towel again. Then I put a dime-sized amount of the Soy Renewal in my palm, and rub my hands together (I have thick hair down past my shoulder blades, so you only need a little bit!).&lt;br /&gt;Flip head upside down, pat the ends of my hair with my palms, then pat all over my hair, flip my hair to one side and then the other, still patting. I finish with hair at the top of my head (by which point my palms are basically dry) and then brush the oil through.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I pat is to get the Soy Renewal all through my hair, without applying too much in any one spot (and especially not too much on top!) I also try to avoid blow-drying, or at least try to blow-dry on the low, cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this for every shower when I first got the Soy Renewal, then reduced it to twice a week now, to just keep a healthy silkiness in my hair. Sometimes, if I&#x27;m rushed, I&#x27;ll put a little in, blow dry, then rub a tiny amount all over my hair to calm the blow-outs. It is soooo much softer now, doesn&#x27;t fly away or frizz out, and I feel comfortable with wearing it down. So far I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months, and that $20 bottle is only *maybe* a third gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that this was probably not intended as a styling mechanism like hairspray or gel. My boyfriend&#x27;s dad got a hold of my Soy Renewal one day, and tried to gel his short hair with it. He ended up going to work with very very shiny hair, that had not moved from its original position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it feels nice, it smells nice, it works well, and compared to other hair products, it is not that expensive at all (especially considering how far a little bit will go!) I would definitely recommend giving this a shot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to cut to the chase...Hands down this the BEST, and I repeat, The BEST Hair Oil treatment on the market. I have tried so many brands and my last two favorites were the Moroccan oil and the One and Only Argan oil, and although they did make my clients hair more healthy looking and shiny, they left the tresses weighed down and if used too much, greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have found Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal Treatment and nothing else is better! If you sincerely want nonstop complements and healthy,bouncy,shiny,weightless,Super Star hair you must try this product. A dime size is all you need especially If your plagued  with dry, rebellious, colored treated, relaxed or abused lack luster locks; this will be your Holy Grail. The reviews are all true. This stuff is a liquid Gold miracle!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. My hair is SO soft now and shiny. Blow drying is so fast now and my hair feels amazing all day after using this. My hair is really damaged from dying but this stuff makes it so shiny and smooth. I was using Its a 10 leave in conditioner (which is also VERY nice), but since I can only really afford one product right now I&#x27;m definitely sticking to this. My hair has not tangled during the day since using this. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this! My hair stylist introduced me to this product, and my hair felt SO silky after she used it that I bought some for myself (and that&#x27;s saying a lot, because I&#x27;m very cheap when it comes to buying hair products). I use it every day, and it makes my hair soft without making it look greasy (like every other hair styling product I&#x27;ve tried). I bought a different brand once, but I hated the smell and the greasy look of my hair, so I returned it and bought this instead. Plus it lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> Great product! It makes the hair feel very silky and smooth! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have smooth bouncy hair.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Morraccan oil at half the price. It smells nice,  and is a great dry oil. Highly recomend</li>
    <li> Product was as expected</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I like the fact that is an oil but it&#x27;s not greasy. It makes your hair very soft and frizz free.</li>
    <li> this works miracles on dry hair .It was shipped to me very fast.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Argan Oil. It has helped my hair look healthier. My hair blow drys quicker and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Product received packaged and protected very well! I love this product as it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily, smells nice, and helps your hair become beautiful! It was recommended by my hair stylist - but I have been paying over double the price at the salon! I will be purchasing from this site in the future! Very excited!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair before flat ironing or using my blow dryer and it helps keep the color longer and not be brittle and dry</li>
    <li> great product to help control dry, frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Use this all the time on my curly out of control hair.  It really helps.  Amazon has the best deals around on this product.  I will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> This a product I use before I blow dry my hair.  It really helps keep it soft and doesn&#x27;t have an overly greasy feel to it.  But I use very little of it on my ends.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Really makes my hair soft and shiny without being greasy. Will definitely get it again. LOVE</li>
    <li> My often frizzy, semi-curly hair, stays smooth and very soft and silky to the touch in the humid weather. This is a great product!!</li>
    <li> I really love what this is doing for my curly, dry, frizzy hair. However I cannot get over the fact that it is flammable. A bit frightening. How can it be flammable yet at the same time protect from the heat of a flat iron? Puzzling and not necessarily something I want on or even near my scalp. But I still cannot help but use it every day and rate this at 4 stars, it is working wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> Exellent beauty product</li>
    <li> I bought this Sexy hair soy renewal styling treatment recommended by someone and I just love it ! will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I gave this product only three stars simply because it doesn&#x27;t do wonders for my hair. Maybe this will be best for people with straight hair or when blow drying. I have hair between wavy and curly and I can&#x27;t use this product by itself. I must use a thicker oil or some hair pudding. I try to stay away from gel and mousse. It does soften my hair and it does allow my hair to dry rather nicely, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily but I really love it! Specially with the price, such a great deal! I have a pixie cut so I know the bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> For me its just another product haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally purchase expensive hair products (Pantene works for me), but this product is amazing. I use it while my hair is still damp and rub it on my ends. I have very fine hair, but this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down - in fact, it makes it more silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair is kinda dry and can be frizzy in humidity so this smoothes it down! My friend tried it on her daughter bc she has thick coarse hair and Loved it. She said she didn&#x27;t cry when brushing her wet hair anymore.</li>
    <li> I have dry, colored, damaged hair and this product helps with all the frizz.  My hair is smooth and silky after use and a few days after also.  It does not leave my hair oily.  I have had better luck with applying the product to my hair dry and then styling.  But I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Actually I was so exsited when I ordered this product that&#x27;s because I resd many good reviews about it but after I got it I realy whant to ask what did they speak about?!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the full size after I received a mini sample size in my Ipsy Glam Bag. I put a little in my hair after a shower and in the morning my hair feels silky smooth!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  I have very curly hair and it made my hair dry and flyaway.  Cheap products in a general store worked better than this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out many different products for my short, curly, often frizzy hair and this is the product I keep coming back to.  It consistently works to tame my hair into a somewhat manageable mop!  I put it on while my hair is still wet, run my fingers through my hair, and I&#x27;m good to go.  The smell is pleasant as well:  not over-poweringly sweet and perfumey.  Instead, it is a more down-to-earth, natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful when you travel with it, though:  the lid leaks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this product. I have used it a few times already and it works great. It left my dry damaged hair soft and shinny. And I only use a drop or two I have super long hair and it goes on amazingly</li>
    <li> I used it for a few days and bought 3 from amazon.  Love the entire line!!!!!!  It&#x27;s great on dry skin as well and no greasy feeling.  Very light scent!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 years now and it makes my hair so soft.  I never use conditioner -once I put this on the brush goes right through my hair and it makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> love the item but the I think the packaging was defected.  I have to keep it in a cup because it seems to be leaking some where.  The cap seems to be backwards compared to the bottle I had before.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really terrific.  I had a bottle I bought at my salon and loved, then I tried to save money by switching to a low-cost brand.  Big mistake!  The other brand seemed watered down and I had to use a lot more with poor results.  So I went back to Sexy Hair (Amazon offered a better price, btw) and I&#x27;m all smiles again!  A small (nickel sized) amount of this product adds tons of softness and shine to my just below should length hair.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as other oils I&#x27;ve tried--which I like!&lt;br /&gt;Helps add shine and moisture to the driest of hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells weird and has a lot of flammable warnings (scary). It&#x27;s usable, but I&#x27;d go with something else if you&#x27;re looking for a new hair serum/heat protector.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel. it leaves my hair feeling softer, and more flexible. I have told my family and friends about this product. its really good on any hair type. I have dreads and it worked for me:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal Treatment! I have chemically treated, dry, and damaged hair and this is one of the only products that I have tried that works great on my hair. I use this product on my hair after every shower when it is damp, and my hair dries looking much more shiny and sleek. It also feels a lot smoother and is much more manageable. In fact, I ran out of this product and didn&#x27;t have any for about 1-2 weeks and I noticed a huge difference in my hair. It was much more dry and damaged looking. I love how this product helps my split ends stay together to look better. I will definitely continue repurchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I gave these product a full rating due the extreme effective on my dry hair, So far until now it does the perfect job !!</li>
    <li> Worked awesome for my thin and did not make it oily</li>
    <li> Sexy Hair Soy Renewal Treatment is a great hair product.  It keeps my hair shiny, smooth, and healthy looking each time I use it!</li>
    <li> I probably don&#x27;t use it correctly, but basically I have wavy, thick hair that decides if it wants to be curly or straight.  I use this product often after my hair has had a chance to dry a little from my shower.  I really get a beautiful, healthy shine without frizz. I love how \\&quot;happy\\&quot; my hair looks, and how naturally vibrant it appears to be.</li>
