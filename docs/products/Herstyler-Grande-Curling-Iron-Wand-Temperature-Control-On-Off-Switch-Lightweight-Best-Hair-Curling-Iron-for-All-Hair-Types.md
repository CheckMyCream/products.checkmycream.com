<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sent it back as soon as I held it in my hand. Conair makes a better product for the same price. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is a nice curler especially for a beginner like me. I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time doing my hair in the morning. this is great for me. It curls  quickly and holds all day even without hairspray. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the base becomes hot pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it. Its convenient, quick and the price is right!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with curling wands, this is easy to use and it does come with a glove. It heats up quickly and is lightweight. It also has the swivel cord so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that my curls stay reasonably well with it (unless its very humid) - they always relax over time, my hair is a little past my shoulders- with little to no product. Usually, I spray heat protectant on each section before wrapping my hair, which tends to create better hold than if I don&#x27;t. If I hairspray after curling each piece, I get better results as well. On average, I have to hold my hair on the wand approximately 10 seconds to get my curls to last a bit longer. After sleeping on my curled hair, it&#x27;s essentially just wavy in the morning, which works too, but I usually have to retouch at least the front pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a 19mm NuMe before - had purchased it via Groupon - and I have to say this is generally less effective. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the extra 10 degrees that the NuMe heats up (this one gets to 400, the NuMe gets to 410) or perhaps the amount of ceramic/tourmaline differs in each - but the NuMe keps my curls better, with less time spent holding my hair on the wand, with less frizz, and they stayed almost perfectly overnight with no product at all. HOWEVER - I had the NuMe for about 8 months and it suddenly stopped working (hence my purchase of this item since they seemed nearly identical), so that was a big downfall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if this was the only wand I&#x27;d ever used, I think I&#x27;d be pretty happy with it. Also, it was cheap, and you can&#x27;t beat that! If you&#x27;re willing to spend a little extra time and hairspray by section you should get a great result!</li>
    <li> I love it because, well, happy wife happy life. She has insanely straight, flat hair. This brings volume and curls! She looks super cute with curly hair, so I guess I benefit from this as well! The added glove is totally necessary apparently, as the way you curl your hair requires the use of the glove. Also, there allegedly some kind of technique you have to get down to use this thing....but once you get it you&#x27;re good, or so I&#x27;ve been told.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely IN LOVEEEEE with this wand curler! It&#x27;s amazing and the price is great ! Def a great buy and I would recommend it to everybody !</li>
    <li> its not as easy to used it as they show it</li>
    <li> Just love this !! I have long hair and curly my hair often and curls stay in- great buy and fast shipping ! Thank you</li>
    <li> overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Heats up fast and does the job good. I never thought my hair would stay curled until this wand! Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how hot the handle of the wand gets, I&#x27;ve burnt myself multiple times already.</li>
    <li> Awesome curling iron! How have I been out of the loop all this time? Love it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, fabolous curls!!! Would recommened it to any of my friends. Great price point too. Best hair product I have.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and wear it curly 98% of the time (because it&#x27;s too easy) but in that 2% of the time that I want to do something different with it without using a straightening iron and losing all body.  I&#x27;ve used it several times, including on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and have absolutely no complaints.  It heats up really well (highly recommend a heat protectant -- it&#x27;s that hot!) and I love the swivel cord.  The price was great compared to what I found in stores.  I hope to get a smaller one to fix my strays when I wear it curly.</li>
    <li> Dont care much for it...there are no instructions..</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give if five stars as my granddaughter asked for this at Christmas which she got and absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this wand it curls my hair so fast and it also heats up very well. I also love that the cord is London and it swivels.</li>
    <li> Love love love this curling wand! I have trouble getting my hair to curl but not with this wand!</li>
    <li> Product looked exactly like the picture, and it worlds great :) good deal</li>
    <li> This item was broken when I received it and as a busy mother I haven&#x27;t had the time to return it. Didn&#x27;t realize there was a window for return on an expensive item</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand this gives the best beach waves and for such a good prices!! Definitely a good buy :)</li>
    <li> My mom and dad purchased this as a birthday gift for my 19th birthday, after I told them how much I wanted it. I had tried this wand from one of my friends, and it is the only curling iron that has ever worked on my hair! I have really fine hair and curls usually don&#x27;t hold, but with this wand it holds curl for up to three days! So stoked over this curling iron and I would say it is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well! If you&#x27;re looking for a curling iron THIS IS THE ONE!!!</li>
    <li> This curler is awesome!! it heats up really fast but you definantly want to use the glove be its REALLY hot but that&#x27;s what I like about it!! the curls are gorgeous and shiny! and it got to my house a lot sooner than expected. and its a lot cheaper here than anywhere else, its makes the perfect size curls!! I definantly recommend this curling iron!!!!!!!!!!! You are not gonna waste your money!</li>
    <li> Quick delIvery, gets hot in 10 seconds! I love it!</li>
    <li> Entire Curler gets hot including the part where you hold it. I&#x27;ve gotten burned several times and I&#x27;m very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I have super LONG absolutely STRAIGHT hair! It used to take almost 3 hours to curl my hair, WITH about a full bottle of hairspray at that. Now with this beautiful magic wand im done in about 30-45 minutes! With NO hairspray what so ever! The curls will last to even the very next day. I say you should buy this awesome wand, its worth every penny and I would do it over again if I had to! Use the glove with it, it makes life easier :-) ! Buy it, buy it, buy it!! You will not go wrong! Beauty has no price tag! $20 is soo worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one in my family. I have one for each kid</li>
    <li> I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase! Shipment was fast with no issues involved. The wand heats up fast and is HOT, however it has no options for heat temperature. It does come with the glove as shown in the picture. The curls come out beautifully when done properly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CURLER!  I have very little experience and it is super easy to use, and the end result looks great!  I did burn myself the first time I used it but I am clumsy - but do be careful as it does get VERY hot, and DO wear the glove unless you&#x27;re experienced with this type of curler!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Loved it!!!!! Amazing product ! The only thing is I prefer to not use the glove but it works great!</li>
    <li> This curling iron curls well,  but where the cord connects to the iron breaks and I have to replace the curling iron.</li>
    <li> The curling iron i just bought, works perfectly and the globes help you to avoid accidents.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. I have never used one before so I bought this one based on its reviews and I am not disappointed! It makes the perfect curl that I have failed to do with a traditional curling iron. Not only that but the curls stay beautiful all day long. I love this curling wand!!</li>
    <li> Love my wonderful curler!!! It curls and make waves that lasts all day. It does get very hot and it only has one setting, so if you&#x27;re not used to using one of these, I would recommend you use the glove.</li>
    <li> Gets super hot! Received in 2 days. Works great!</li>
    <li> I use it every day. great product</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. i never curl my hair and its never held a curl before. i curled my hair in the evening one night and it serriously stayed curled for like 2 and a half days! no product either! i got sooooo many compliments and looks and stares. i cant wait to shower and curl it it agian tonight! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it I have bleached frizzy hair i like to dye my hair and I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to work because since my hairs bleached curls come out and it doesn&#x27;t straighten we&#x27;ll this works amazing curls come out perfect... however it is hot and I did burn myself but honestly my hair looked perfect for 2 days I even did my hair the night before and when I woke up the curls were still in place I just had to do a little touch up for the fly away strands but honestly for 25 dollars its amazing does its job.</li>
    <li> A mom of four girls. This wand is awesome. I do recommend that if you are not use to using the wand use the glove. That comes with it. Went on YouTube to get tutorials for the wand. Now use more than my curling iron.</li>
    <li> My hair is impossible to curl, I have tried numerous tools. This styler is instant beautiful full curls. I can do my whole head (a lot of hair) in less than 20 minutes. I am IN LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Love it, easy to use and fast waves</li>
    <li> Works Wonders my hair is very straight and curls perfectly. It&#x27;s going to take a couple of times for you to learn how to use it and what works best for you. I personally don&#x27;t like the glove I feel that it gets in my way, but it is very hot and will burn you so you have to be carful. I have given it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the fact that it dose not have a temperature control and does not have an off and on button but, you can tell when it&#x27;s on by the light not a huge big deal. I love it and beats paying 150.00 at the mall.</li>
    <li> Excellent curling iron! I am severely challenged when it comes to styling my hair; ponytails are my forte. I bought this curling iron, and I LOVE IT! It is so quick and easy to style my hair. Having two kids, 5 and 7 months, ease and speed are a must.</li>
    <li> My fault make sure to read everything before you make a purchase.don&#x27;t just buy something because it looks good.I gave them to my granddaughter she knew how to use them And I ordered something I knew how to use.smiling</li>
    <li> This product is seriously fantastic!  I have pretty thick, but fine hair, and I could never get the curls to stay when using a regular curling iron or flat iron.  I&#x27;m not usually good with beauty stuff, normally the only thing I can do to my own hair is straighten it or throw it up in a bun.  This curling rod is so easy to use (I looked up a tutorial on YouTube just to be sure I was doing it properly) and my hair comes out beautifully wavy every time! I totally recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> We have the small and large version now and love them both!  The small makes tiny curls for my girls competition hair and it the large makes loose waves.  I have thin hair, shoulder length hair and both daughters have thick hair down to the middle of their backs.  This curling iron curls in less than half the time of our previous one and the curls stay when the other ones never did!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Love it , fast shipping also</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for! I wanted something that would give me big curls and would hold. I love this wand. The photos are of my hair 6 hours after curling after a full day out with no hairspray and spending 10 min scrambling through my hair and quickly curling. I like it messy !!! Life saver :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Only negative is that is hard to make it stay still.</li>
    <li> It arrived a day before the estimated arrival, I was surprised. It works realy gooood :) I love it! I went to the herstyler website, this wand is $200, and I got it for $25. Win win</li>
    <li> Received the product right when it was promised.  Heats up quickly and works great.  Glove is a great bonus! Thanks</li>
    <li> The product description is accurate, good quality and image. Fulfilled with my expectations. You can trust and purchase it without any inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Exactly as advertised and works AMAZING! I have really thick hair so curling takes FOREVER!! but this was quick and easy!</li>
    <li> Handle gets way too hot</li>
    <li> I love the wand, it heats up fast and holds for a long time, and its much faster than using a clamp curling iron. What i dont like about this wand is the bulkiness of the cord, it seems really unnecessary and if i dont pile the whole cord onto the counter the weight will pull the whole iron down because its attached so heavily to the end of it. also, i would love if it had a light to indicate that its on. with other people in the house it makes me nervous that someone will accidentally burn themselves not knowing that its on. Otherwise, the wand does exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> This wand is an okay curling wand. It feels completely different than the one sold in the mall. Edison mall where I live. As I assume not the real thing. I give this a 2 star because only ONE heat setting which is 400, I don&#x27;t want to put that high setting into my hair. As for the curls, they make but as I said I didn&#x27;t want to leave it for more than 8 seconds with that much heating.</li>
    <li> It was okay makes hair kinda frizzy I don&#x27;t like that too much but the curls are really nice !</li>
    <li> Great and fast at making nice curls, gets really hot by the handle too. I also have really thick hair and it works well, but I would not suggest for thin hair because the iron would be too hot for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a celebrity I like has raved about it and her hair is beautiful. (She is no affiliation with the company so it was a legit review.) In all honesty it does heat up quick and gives me nice curls. My curls typically stay in all day, falling a little bit as the day goes on. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because up until this point I have been using my sister&#x27;s Remington wand. (The pink one, I think it has pearl in the name.) That thing was AMAZING. It would keep my curls firm and tight for days. Even when I pulled my hair back in a pony tail, they would fall back down into beautiful tight curls hours later. If it hadn&#x27;t been for my experience with the Remington wand then this wand would have received a higher review, but overall the Remington is a better wand for my hair. (Which is fine, but thick) I will say though I like how the shaft of this want is pretty much the same size, whereas the Remington has more of a point.</li>
    <li> This styler is everything to me! My curls stay in tact, have had no issues. This product came in a beautiful pink box. Along with a heat protective glove for my hand. A friend of mind actually has this same product. That is how and why I knew about the her styler.  Unfortunately she paid a lot of money for her curler. And its exactly the same as mine. Take care of this product and it will last on you. Avoid from dropping it. I don&#x27;t care if mine breaks. I would buy another one just because how flawless my curls come out.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this product.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Hard to hold and twirl.  I am just not coordinated to do this. Perhaps best for someone who is working on someone else&#x27;s hair would have better luck. However thats the user, the Iron was in perfect condition and heats up really fast to a very high temp.</li>
    <li> Great Great  product I was surprised</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and curls my hair perfectly, just wish it had heat settings.</li>
    <li> It wirks as expected.  The glove doesn&#x27;t work that well, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Great love it . We&#x27;ll worth the money and fast service .</li>
    <li> I love this Wand! The best I&#x27;ve used! It&#x27;s easy and it gives me amazing curls! I have medium length hair and I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to curl it, but boy was I wrong! I recommend you wear the glove since the wand gets really hot!&lt;br /&gt;But I totally recommend this wand! 👌🏼</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait before reviewing to make sure it worked.  I am happy to say I have been using it for about 6 months and I still love it.  Great buy and only takes a few uses to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a year! Great buy!</li>
    <li> this hair wand gets extremly hot works well i would recommend this product to any...</li>
    <li> nothing was missing or broken! everything was in tact. got delivered very fast!</li>
    <li> This curling wand makes beautiful curls for any chick looking to add some pop to her hair! Be VERY careful when using this, though. I have burned myself and it leaves visible marks that hurt. Make sure you use the glove, no matter how unnecessary you may think it is.</li>
    <li> Nice curl! It gets pretty hot and heats up quick! I really like my curling wand and I love the curl it gives</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the curls! The only thing is there is no light to tell if it is on or not.</li>
    <li> Got dangerously hot. The company returned with no issues.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my sister&#x27;s wedding on myself and several kids.  Great product will highly recommend, great curls, stayed on all day even after the kids were running around.</li>
    <li> The handle gets extremely hot... almost the point of not being able to use it. I should have returned it but waited to long to even try it. I would not recommend. :(</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair so its a bit big for me and I can never attain tight, small curls without extensions. But that&#x27;s just me. On a positive note, the curls last long and it heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my Granddaughter, she loved it!!! She has used it many times and thanked me over and over for getting it for her.</li>
    <li> This works just as expected use caution though because it does get very hot!</li>
    <li> I love this wand. My hair, which is practically impossible to curl, curls with this iron. I do use the glove when I&#x27;m doing my own hair, but not when I&#x27;m using it on other people. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now and use it all the time. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and first was doubdful if it would work. My wife loved it and enjoys using it till today.</li>
    <li> FAKE do not buy!!!! Replica of the original. Amazon is not an authorized user of HerStyler. This product is $20 because it is a cheap piece of plastic and not 100% ceramic. I gave it 2 stars for heating up well and doing it&#x27;s job but the handle got so hot I had to wear my own personal winter leather glove to avoid a burn. I had to wear 2 gloves to curl my hair. The safety instructions mentioned &amp;#34; a red light to indicate when the unit is operating.&amp;#34; Mine did not even come with a red light! You cannot tell when it is on unless you do a touch test which in this case is dangerous. I have been a loyal her styler customer and bought the pink straightener 2 years back. This was the best purchase ever in a mall for $100. It had a red light and temperature control. The yellow plates worked great but it isn&#x27;t ceramic because those plates only come in black. Most say 100% ceramic but are only coated. I&#x27;m my suggestion but the real product from an authorized seller. This product is not safely manufactured. I called customer service and the woman didn&#x27;t even know if a red light existed. She told me she would call back because the &amp;#34;design tech&amp;#34; is busy. The warrenton card mentions you must pay $15 for shipping. I&#x27;m sorry that 3/4 the price I paid for the damn item. I should just sell this piece of plastic on eBay.</li>
    <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
    <li> Great curls and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seriously been needing a curling iron for the longest time ever. I bought this wand-- with somewhat low expectations. Common phrase like &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; quickly comes to mind when buying a cheap product. Overall-- I&#x27;m freaking IN LOVE. Seriously. Best curling wand I&#x27;ve owned. Hands down. I loveeee it. Would def recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for &#x27;beachy&#x27; kind of hair curls. ❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great and the perfect product b to purchase if you want your hair to look naturally curly. The quality is great too!! Just be careful because big already burnt myself three time and one of them is a scar :-(</li>
    <li> I love it, but unfortunately I got a defective one so had to return it. But I´m about to order again, and hopefully this one will be perfect and not pull my hair out.</li>
    <li> Love this!! The curls last all day! Totally worth buying.</li>
    <li> Great product for my thick hair</li>
    <li> It works wonders. nothing works on my hair flatirons or curling irons but this wand works every time and the curls last. It is amazinggg</li>
    <li> First of all I loved the price of this team. I had seen this same product at my local mall for 80 dollars. I thought they were crazy I was very happy to have purchase this with amazon.</li>
    <li> Gets hot but I hate not having temp control and while using this, I accidentally switch it off and don&#x27;t even realize it. Switch is in a poor location. Glove is okay but your hand still gets hot. My curls didn&#x27;t last as long as expected. Overall, good for the price.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3JCX3SD1K8FMM]]There are no temperature controls on this Herstyler Grande Pink Hair Professional Curling Iron.  You simply flip the switch and it rapidly heats up to 400°.  Before you even begin to consider curling, wait until the iron heats up thoroughly.  The HerSyler is a professional iron and the heat generated can be steep so there&#x27;s a nice heat-resistant glove included.  It&#x27;s soft, comfortable black glove double-stitched with pink on the top of the elasticized cuff.  If you haven&#x27;t already, it would probably be wise to invest some sort of holder to house it in when you use it.  No way would you want to lay this hot curling iron on a counter. There are a lot of affordable ones out there, including HerStyler, but picking one out is a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to create a frizzy mess, you certainly can do so with any kind of straightener or curling iron.  You should definitely be using moisturizing conditioners and some sort of heat protectant if you&#x27;re going to use the HerStyler on a regular basis.  A little protection will keep your hair from becoming damaged and worn out looking.  Selecting a proper curling iron will ensure that you get the proper type of curl you want.  If you are looking at the HerStyler Grande iron, you&#x27;re looking at one that will give you smaller curs because the barrel is less than 1\\&quot; in diameter.  The larger the barrel, the larger the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe there&#x27;s an error in the description because the barrel is not Teflon, it&#x27;s Tourmaline, something that is actually quite desirable.  It will help reduce that frizz, something not many want.  According to HerStyler the \\&quot;Tourmaline barrel creates smooth, glossy curls using Ceramic technology, which produces negative ions to seal cuticles and repel humidity.\\&quot;  This I know nothing about, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t care to use a curling iron coated in Teflon.  I&#x27;m sure in time the description will be corrected.  The barrel heats up within a minute and I was in front of the mirror trying it out.  My hair is very short (and rather unmanageable), but I was able to get some curl into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Tourmaline Barrel heats to 400° F&lt;br /&gt;►  Clipless Barrel&#x27;s Diameter: 0.70\\&quot; to 0.98\\&quot; (D) x 6.02\\&quot; (L) [18-25mm (D) to 152mm (L)]&lt;br /&gt;►  Negative Ion Technology&lt;br /&gt;►  Dual Voltage 110-240v&lt;br /&gt;►  Includes Heat Resistant Glove&lt;br /&gt;►  Ergonomic Design Makes It Comfortable to Use&lt;br /&gt;►  Designed in Italy, Engineered with American Technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hot pink HerStylerGrande is very easy to hold and control.  Good thing because I&#x27;m not particular good at using one, but am trying out several HerStyler irons and am getting better at it.  I most certainly had that heat-resistant glove on the hand I was using to hold and hold my hair.  Not once did I get burned and I could even grasp the barrel and feel the temp rise when I was in the preheating process.  I tried it on dry hair, but for me it worked better on damp.  I don&#x27;t usual curl my hair because, depending on the weather, it can manage to do so by itself.  It&#x27;s not recommended that you use these on wet hair in an attempt to style and dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know anything about \\&quot;negative ions,\\&quot; but only know how well this HerStyler worked.  If you are interested in them and you don&#x27;t know about them, perhaps a little research is in order.  Even on my short hair I was able to get a little curl which helped fluff up my hair nicely.  The iron works well, but simply don&#x27;t expect it to do more than it claims to do and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.was in front of the mirror trying it out.

    <li> I ordered it and received it a few short days later and the product seems to be in perfect condition. I really enjoy the protective glove it came with and the chord is super long. The only thing I wish would have came with it is a booklet with ideas and how to use it to create different curls! Good thing I can use google for that :)</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve burned myself a couple of times. This has been all my fault because I was in a hurry each time I did it. The wand itself is great. There is no temp control, but it heats up fast. The curls last two days for me but I work out and sweat plays a role in losing them. I read the reviews on this product and decided to try it. I watched YouTube videos to learn how to use the product. The wand is really thebomb.com! The only two things I would have on a dream wand would be a temp control and a larger barrell. But hey, I paid $24 for this thing, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Wife purchased this curling iron based on all the reviews and she enjoys it.  It gets quite hot and seems to do everything she wishes.  The size seems a little small, the barrel could be a bit bigger, if so that would have made this a 5 star for her!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love it! It&#x27;s perfect and I love that it comes with a hair serum.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful iron. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This curling iron does the job. The only thing I wished it had was an automatic turn off safety feature. My daughter always leaves it on.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best curling iron i have ever used.. curls so fast &amp; was a very good price. cute color as well</li>
    <li> This product is nice, I have short hair and I can use it. But I can wait to use it in some with long hair to see if works better. I did used yesterday and went out after the rain, and my hair stay the same, it did not got frizzed</li>
    <li> I love my curling wand so much! I don&#x27;t use it everyday but it is amazing. My curls come out great. I was dying to have one and when I received this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! I would recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand, but wish the temperature was adjustable.</li>
    <li> Came on time and heats really well. It get very hot so use the glove as recommended.</li>
    <li> BY FAR the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used! it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. makes perfect curls that hold all day long. it normally is pretty hard to curl my hair and takes an hour, I have long hair and it literally take 10 minutes tops.</li>
    <li> Gets nice and hot. Wish it had a light so it was more obvious when it was on, but other than that its great. So nice that it comes with the glove!</li>
    <li> Have to roll no clamp!</li>
    <li> Looking at the product itself i would have given one or two stars for how cheap it feels in your hands. I was disappointed because my straightner seemed of such great quality i expected the same for this iron, but honestly it still delivers its purpose. It curls amazingly. I wanted a bigger barrel but it heats quick and lasts long so i guess thats what really matters</li>
    <li> I have super straight hair and no matter how many products I use I can&#x27;t get my hair to hold curl. The first time I used this iron I fell in love with it my hair looked just like it did right after I curled it 24 hours later, even after I had slept on it. It also takes less than half the time of a regular curling iron. The only thing I would add is an indicator light to let you know when the iron has completely heated up, but I just turn it on and wait maybe 2 mins and it is usually hot enough for me. The glove is great I had read a couple reviews before I purchased this item that the glove didn&#x27;t work that well but I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt once yet. Great product definately worth the price. A++++!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing !!! Best purchase ever made</li>
    <li> It truly is amazing, heats up quickly and I can do my whole head of hair in 10 minutes or less. The curls stay, which is incredible because even when I give myself curls with a Chi flat iron they don&#x27;t stay (not to mention that I&#x27;ve tried several other curling irons like hot tools and the curls would fall flat within 2 hours). This is a quality product and worth getting. The only downside is that there is no on/off indicator light, but I can just look at the switch and tell. It&#x27;s not rocket science. Plus I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s better to get a black barrel curling iron because those are hotter. Mine has actually burned my hand several times before I caved and started using the glove that comes with the iron (trust me, save yourself the trouble and do this from the beginning!). Anyway, that&#x27;s my 2 cents. I love this product and highly recommend it. I&#x27;d been trying to get victorias secret loose curls for years and with this product I can finally do it. Go to youtube for tutorials on how to use it and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> How can this tiny, pink wand create such gorgeous curls? I don&#x27;t know, and I don&#x27;t care. This curler is amazing. I have long hair (down to the small of my back). I quit curling it long ago, because the curls never lasted. These curls last until I go to bed. In fact, they are still there the morning after. The wand heats quickly and always leaves a perfect curl. The product was shipped very quickly!</li>
    <li> Does not get hot or curl like the actual brand it is a horrible copy</li>
    <li> LOVE IT ! Exactly as the website said it was :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend anyone to buy</li>
    <li> It is awesome love it</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! It does exactly what it is designed to do. I do not see the point in the glove because it really isn&#x27;t easy to use and curl your hair at the same time. I feel like the glove also made my hair filled with static! It is not too big of an issue because it is just as easy to use it without the glove. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this wand 5 stars is because the pink part that is closer to the barrel gets really...really hot and I feel like it has the potential to burn you.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. Delivery is very fast, heat up is extremely quick, curling is easy, and glove is very helpful. Also, the curls do hold fairly well-just not over night.</li>
    <li> The curler works really well but the only problem was where the wire turns when you move is kind of hard to turn.</li>
    <li> The curls look nice, but you get what you pay for. The whole iron heats up and it burns my hand. I&#x27;d rather get something a little nicer.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product 6 stars wow I luv everything about it from tha color to how easy it is to use and that&#x27;s coming from a girl who does not knw how to curl hair / it&#x27;s super easy and ur hair looks like u just stepped out of tha Solon</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned! The curl stays for days! I reccomend for this for anyone looking for a quick way to style your hair. The heat up time was less than 20 seconds!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME USING A CURLING WAND AND I LOVED THE RESULTS :)&lt;br /&gt;I HAD NEVER HAD MY CURLS LAST ALL DAY AND WITH THE CURLING WAND THEY DID AND&lt;br /&gt;I DIDNT EVEN USE HAIRSPRAY.. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS WAND IT IS VERY EASY TO USE&lt;br /&gt;AND THE CURLS COME OUT PERFECT NOT TOO TIGHT OR TOO LOOSE. THE SIZE OF THE&lt;br /&gt;BARREL IS 25 MM (1 INCH)  IT DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT TO LET YOU KNOW WHEN ITS HOT&lt;br /&gt;OR TO CONTROL THE HEAT TEMP THATS THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE IT JUST HAS AN ON&lt;br /&gt;AND OFF SWITCH AND IT GETS EXTREMELY HOT SECONDS AFTER YOU TURN IT ON SO I&lt;br /&gt;DO RECOMMEND USING SOME KIND OF HEAT PROTECTOR ON YOUR HAIR TO PREVENT&lt;br /&gt;DAMAGE. OVERALL THE HERSTYLER WAND IS A GREAT PRODUCT :)</li>
    <li> Been watching this product for a while  now reading the comments to decide if this would be a great product for  me well i finally purchase it and I love love love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed. I expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews, especially at this price point. This was my first curling wand, and I saw nothing special about the curls it generated. I can do that with my regular curling iron without using the clip. There&#x27;s no temperature control on this, and even the top of the pink part gets really hot! I can&#x27;t even hold the wand with the glove on because it&#x27;s just a basic glove. And the quality and make of the model is so light!</li>
    <li> Its perfect curls great and heats up really hot !</li>
    <li> doesnt heat up hot as i would like it to but it curls nice always get committees</li>
    <li> Not easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend for people who want an easy simple styling tool. I&#x27;ve used it once since I bought it and didn&#x27;t like the results at all.</li>
    <li> I find it very hard to use, I can&#x27;t feel what I&#x27;m doing with my hair, because of the glove. If I don&#x27;t use the glove it&#x27;s hard to get the ends of my hair curly because it burns me. Overall the curls look great afterward, but it is very difficult to get it looking that way.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My old curling wand, which I bought from a kiosk in the mall cost $110 and it broke down on me after 5 years. I love curling my hair and I wanted to find a good product without breaking the bank. I came across this curling wand so I went ahead and ordered it. It shipped SUPER fast and I love the way it curls. The wand gets really hot and the style lasts for a whole day without getting too loose. Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> My daughter is an all star cheerleader and she borrowed this product to use for a competition. Great curls and easy to use, once you get the hang of it. Now she uses it for beautiful soft curls for school. Amazing price compared to the Herstyler website! I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My teen loves this product.  It makes super cute curls that stay for quite a while in my daughter straight fine hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect curls every single time!!</li>
    <li> Sucks. It worked well for a few weeks and now barely heats up. I wouldn&#x27;t buy ever again.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. Great product</li>
    <li> Works amazingly, heats up within seconds. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It works really good. I recommend getting it</li>
    <li> This is the best!!! My hair will stay curly for 3 days when I use this. My other curling irons will be going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Soo easy to use!!! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I was expecting something a bit nicer than what I got. It is VERY cheaply made, has only one setting, the handle gets very hot, and no light to indicate if it is on. I&#x27;m already looking for a replacement. The two stars I give it are for the glove and because it did curl my hair.</li>
    <li> This curler is amazing. I tried it as soon as I got it. It curled my hair and the curls held! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I like the way your  curls turn out. I like it just have problems when its comes to curling the ends</li>
    <li> You will burn the ever-loving hell out of your entire body if you&#x27;re not careful with this wand.&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch gets flipped easily.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes it, just has to get used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes beautiful curls! She has also tried it on her friends hair</li>
    <li> i always use heat styling products with caution,, but i accidently burned my arm and it left a nasty scar</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my order. A family member bought the same one and her long thick hair looks great.  I have a lot of hair and medium lengthen. It does well with my hair. I have had a lot of complaints. I am a true believer that the traditional curling iron is so last year.</li>
    <li> Best hair purchase I&#x27;ve done in years I will continue to buy these products . And not bad priced at all well worth my money. Suggest every girl own one.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It really does what it is meant to do. The heating on this item is great</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product &amp; even recieved an unexpected bonus hair-styling creme! Very good!! Very happy with quality &amp; everything!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week. Curls look great, heat resistant glove definitely helps! The price was right, and my hair was bouncy. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! It&#x27;s fabulous! It&#x27;s one of the only curling wands that keep curls in my hair for up to 3 days. One thing about it though if you have pretty thick hair it&#x27;ll only make it wavy unless you take very small pieces of hair.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
    <li> I just got this hair curler and I love it.  it will take some get use to it being clip less, but the curls it creates are flawless!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it.  She has very straight hair that never kept a curl, but this product really works for her.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes the Perfect curls or waves&lt;br /&gt;And it is very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price !</li>
    <li> Having to get used to using it, works great!! arrived promptly, so glad glove is included, but makes using awkward!!!</li>
    <li> Update: My daughter has been using this for 6 months now and still loves it and it still works great. Looks like my fears on quality were unfounded. At least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my teenage daughter because she wanted a wand curler.  I think it looks like it was made somewhat cheaply, but it gives her fantastic curls, so I don&#x27;t want to take off too many stars. Also, it is a bonus that the glove is whole hand instead of just half of your fingers like some I&#x27;ve seen. I would recommend this for young girls or people wanting to try a wand (I personally don&#x27;t like it but my hair is maybe too short). If you&#x27;re looking for something high quality, try another brand.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and curls hair as per videos found on Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;Glove works to keep heat from burning fingers.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I expected; I could not use it and gave it to my grand daughter. It is definitely a fluff piece of equipment and not to be used every day</li>
    <li> Really wish I would have returned this it just not work like I expected. Can not get a curl to hold.</li>
    <li> I loved this curling iron at first. It got extremely hot so i was able to create the tight beautiful curls i wanted. It is very hard for me to find a curling iron that works fast and makes curls that stay. I had this product for under 2 years and i had to throw it out...I was using it one day and was almost done with my hair when I smelled something electrical burning and looked down to see smoke coming out from where the cord connects to the curling iron. I was really mad that I paid so much for it and could only use it for a year...will not buy another or recommend it....If you want a good deal on safe curling irons see your stylist about buying one since most can get them for you cheaper with their discount at beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Works really well. It takes around a hour and thirty minutes to get done with my hair I have thick medium length hair. It shipped very quickly! Got it within two days. My only complaint is the glove. It&#x27;s hard to use with the glove on and you can still feel the heat with the glove on. It&#x27;s easier to use without the glove. It makes wavy curls. Really satisfied best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Curls my hair heats up quickly love it</li>
    <li> Good price, delivery was as expected, easy transaction. I purchased this product for my niece and she said she really likes it and it does what its  suppose to. She said it does get really hot.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. You are never going to want to go with a clip curler again. This wand heats up so fast and only takes seconds to curl. The curls also LAST very long on real hair and extensions. This curler came with the Ceramic Trio (curler, flat iron and mini dryer) I go on groupon for dirt cheap (yes they are an authorized seller). This wands sells for $200 on the herstyler website. I love this and their other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this to curl my weaves after seeing one of my daughters friends use it on one of them. I must say I love it. Once curled, the curls last for about 3 days and on that third day, the curls have fell so pretty. The only con, is that it gets extremely hot right about where the on and off switch is, but there is a warning lable to let you know.</li>
    <li> Doesnt heat up enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used curling irons without using the clip before, not the same affect. I&#x27;ve also used a straightener that was made to make curls as well, doesn&#x27;t work well. So I wanted to buy a curling wand that wasn&#x27;t the cheapest but not to expensive so after reading reviews for this one I added it to my xmas list and my bf bought it for me. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I can say that the curl holds even the next day! I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair and the curl hold all night so this curling wand really works since i can wake up and still have a curl! I curled my hair tonight brushed it and still have a gorgeous curl with not too much hair spray (I used to have to use a lot with a curling iron and not be able to brush it) (I did use something in my hair before I started tho).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to burn myself like a few reviews have said, the glove isn&#x27;t bad, feel a lil heat thru it but nothing like wow i&#x27;m burning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only grip is that I personally would of liked a bigger curler like 1.5\\&quot; or larger since the curls hold so well and i have thick hair, i use amazon a lot for reviews and have read good ones to where i bought the product and was so disappointed, but trust me you will love this wand if you are looking to curl stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> This gets beautiful curls that last in a  short time... I can sleep in an extra 30 minutes now that it takes less time to curl my hair and whats best is that the curls last all day.</li>
    <li> I needed a curling iron for an event and was SUPER skeptical because in the past curls have never really stayed in my hair over the course of an evening without tons of cement-like product. I have hair down to my waist and it is super thick/coarse and heavy.  And i have a lot of it (a blowout takes a full two hours and my hair&#x27;s not curly).  Final liability: criminal laziness (I airdry my hair every day and use a hairdryer / heatstyling products / flatiron once every 6 months, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By my third use of this iron I&#x27;d learned I can go from plugging in the iron to out the door with full head of awesome beachy waves/ loose curls (the Gisele hair look) in literally &amp;#60;10 minutes (yes I have timed it!).  The barrel on this heats up super quickly, maybe because it&#x27;s not a huge diameter.  I divide all my hair into only 9 kind-of-thick bundles-- 2 bottom left, 2 bottom right, 2 upper left side, 2 upper right and sort of one at the crown -- and I wrap each bundle all the way down the barrel w one hand while holding the iron vertically with the other hand.  Hold each segment for 20-30 seconds.  Swap hands to get the sections on the other side of head.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I personally get better results than with a &amp;#62;$100 salon iron, and SO fast.  I think wrapping more hair around a smaller super hot barrel is really effective -- much more so than smaller segments around a bigger barrel -- for both hold as well as look.  It did take 2 botched initial tries (if your segments are too small you end up with cheesy ringlets), but once i worked out the right amount of hair to wrap each time pass of the iron, i get amazing bouncy loose curls and waves that last all day with ZERO holding product.</li>
    <li> Im so inlove with this wand i did my hair it last for a whole day! But thats not it!! I went to sleep and wake up next day and my hair still carly 😍&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and by it ;) for this price it worth it&lt;br /&gt;By the way they sell it at the mall for $100</li>
    <li> I bought this wand to travel to Europe (from US) because it works across both voltages. It worked very well, heats up quickly, and curls well. Unfortunately, after using it about 5-6 times, I noticed the black wand part was wiggling while I was using it, and soon noticed the pink plastic was oddly cracked. I&#x27;ve been very careful with this, so I can only assume this is some defect that occurred while the rod was hot. I assume if I keep using it like this, eventually it will break completely. Might be a fluke. Not sure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wand/curling iron. I use it almost every day and get tons of complements on my curls. My hair is straight but the curls stay very well in my hair. The product was cheap, and I cannot imagine it working any better. I haven&#x27;t had it long; so I cannot comment on the endurance, but I recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The handle gets super hot, besides that, its awesome!</li>
    <li> I love it! The only thing is that it does get verry hot the first time I used it my arm slipped while trying to release the curl and I burnt my shoulder real bad but it does work real good. And so worth the price ♡</li>
    <li> Love this! I got suckered into buying one in the mall for 4xs as much as this one, and does the same thing. Except this one is way cuter comes in pink my favorite color, very well made and for a very affordable price!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for myself. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I like the look of it and the feel of it. I think it will be just fine. :)</li>
    <li> I have yet to use it as it is a gift for my daughter... I have a herstyler blow dryer that is amazing so I imagine this will be as well. It was shipped quickly, so happy there!</li>
    <li> Love it, works great. It gets very hot and you cannot adjust the temp. I have course hair so that works for me, but on my daughters fine hair I have to be pretty careful</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for a curling wand and after researching and reading reviews this is the 1 I went with, she can&#x27;t stop raving about it &amp; is so excited for it!</li>
    <li> Great, Great, Great. A must have!</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever used! My hair has never been able to hold a curl longer than 5 minutes. It is stick straight! When I used this curling iron, my hair held its curl for two days! On the next day, my hair had large waves to it! It has never done that before. I am so incrdibly pleased with this curling wand!</li>
    <li> Excellent for a first time user and great price. I received a lot of compliments!!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  There is a bit of a learning curve, at least there was for me.  However, the results are worth it. Curls are long lasting and shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is a bit tricky if it&#x27;s your first time using a barrel curling iron, and it is very hot so be careful. I had trouble using it at first, holding the tip and curling from the top, the curls came out a bit messy and awkward looking. But I tried to take a small bunch of hair and twisting them together first, after they are twisted i used the iron to curl them and it came out great. That might have sounded confusing.</li>
