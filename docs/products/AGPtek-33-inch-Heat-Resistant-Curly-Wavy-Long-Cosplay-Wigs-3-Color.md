      <li>Pros: the most amazing periwinkle color I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many wigs, mostly cosplay, and this one was one of the softest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>think just do because it&#x27;s a fantastic wig!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It looks great that way also and is very soft for the price.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely, comfortable wig.</li>
      <li>was packaged nice and arrived right away</li>
      <li>Easy to style</li>
      <li>they get tangled really easily and</li>
      <li>Looks great with a beanie or any other kind of hat.</li>
      <li>The wig is beautiful, but the wig cap itself is tiny!</li>
      <li>Very pretty!</li>
      <li>Overall the wig is great, except for the curls...</li>
      <li>Oh, and it does have an adjustable strap built in so you can tighten it to fit your head.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fullness - not too full, but not thin.  </li>
      <li>The first was that it is not to think in most areas.</li>
      <li>The heat resistant part is true.</li>
      <li>But for the price, not bad.</li>
      <li>Very soft, very easy to split.</li>
      <li>wear with a hat  makes it seem more realistic .</li>
      <li>Breaks up the bold color ...</li>
      <li>It is rather long but nothing a good pair of scissors can&#x27;t handle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>styling is lovely, with soft waves that are very pretty.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, I&#x27;d honestly spend an extra $10 or so and go with something else.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun ...</li>
      <li>Very few tangles, with a light color a white wig cap would be best.</li>
      <li>so soft and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>The color (light blue) is slightly lighter than it appeared on my computer, but that works great for me.  </li>
      <li>Went ahead and ordered another in red for a girl reindeer costume and are just as pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>TO BE AWARE OF:&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably have to hair spray it to make sure the back stays in place and the wig cap doesn&#x27;t show through.</li>
      <li>I love this wig, especially the color.</li>
      <li>That wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, as it&#x27;s cute nonetheless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cam packaged nicely in a fishnet bag and had an extra tension hook in the back that made it fit my 8 year old or me!</li>
      <li>Very realistic.  </li>
      <li>I really like this light blue wig.</li>
      <li>- it came out of the bag ready to wear.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend these wigs!</li>
      <li>Also received it about 3-4 days after I ordered, which is much quicker than I thought I would.  </li>
      <li>Really like it,</li>
      <li>I actually really like this wig.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle though, and got here</li>
      <li>It is not shiny at all and fits very well.</li>
      <li>People think I really colored my hair ..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise this is a really quality wig, and I&#x27;d recommend it for those looking to wear it as-is.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll probably order a few more for fun.</li>
      <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are LONG and do need TRIMMING if you&#x27;d like to see.&lt;br /&gt;The curls TANGLE easily, so have a wig brush ready.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sheds more then other products I have</li>
      <li>It was a decent wig for the price and accomplished what i needed</li>
      <li>The long bangs are super cute and the rest of the hair is long, lustrous and wavy.  </li>
      <li>Really pretty, soft and wavy.</li>
      <li>The bangs are a little shorter than the picture but the wig was made well :)</li>
      <li>I truely love some of the details about this AGPtek 33 inch Heat Resistant Curly Wavy Long Cosplay Wigs-light blue.</li>
      <li>The bangs are not hard to manage and if you put a head piece with it</li>
      <li>I ordered what they call light blue, where the picture shows a desaturated royal blue color.</li>
      <li>The color is an icy blue/periwinkle and very pretty.</li>
      <li>The curls were soft and length was just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
      <li>Really soft and luxurious.</li>
      <li>It felt so soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>Wig came in a plastic bag and in a hair net, very neat and untangled.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sent this to the back of my wig drawer as I&#x27;m not sure what use I&#x27;ll be able to get out of it-</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Bring some bobby pins though, because the front bangs really will hang down quite far and obscure your vision.</li>
      <li>Probably the most poorly constructed wig I&#x27;ve bought in the last three years.</li>

<li> Amazing quality and doesn&#x27;t tangle too badly.  </li>

<li> and I end up having to pat them back down in order to get the stray hairs back into place.&lt;br</li>
<li> If you like it that long keep it!</li>
<li> It might not fit if you have a larger head though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Super impressed with the quality. Fist wig I&#x27;ve ever worn, but for 10 bucks it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, comfortable wig. Given the affordable price we were really happy. It is packaged in such a way as to protect the integrity of the wig&#x27;s hairdo.  The long bangs are super cute and the rest of the hair is long, lustrous and wavy.  We ordered it as part of a Halloween costume and it definitely made the outfit!  Went ahead and ordered another in red for a girl reindeer costume and are just as pleased with it.  Highly recommend these wigs!</li>
    <li> Wig came in a plastic bag and in a hair net, very neat and untangled.  The color (light blue) is slightly lighter than it appeared on my computer, but that works great for me.  It has a nice fullness - not too full, but not thin.  It seems a little bit small fit for my head, but I can make it work with some finagling.  I have not tried to brush or style it yet because I didn&#x27;t have to - it came out of the bag ready to wear.  Also received it about 3-4 days after I ordered, which is much quicker than I thought I would.  Really like it, and I&#x27;ll probably order a few more for fun.</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful, but the wig cap itself is tiny!</li>
    <li> Love it. Beautiful wig and good quality</li>
    <li> I truely love some of the details about this AGPtek 33 inch Heat Resistant Curly Wavy Long Cosplay Wigs-light blue. For example, the color was beautiful. The length, though longer that I thought it would be, was to die for, not too long or too short. It felt so soft to the touch. I&#x27;ve had many wigs, mostly cosplay, and this one was one of the softest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad. Very few things made this list, 2 in fact. The first was that it is not to think in most areas. I have two giant bald spots on the back of the head five minutes after opening it. Even moving around the hair to try and cover it did almost nothing. The second issues is the fact that there were a lot of chopped pieces, giving an almost amateur look if you don&#x27;t manuever the hair to cover it, and even then, slightly moving my head moved all of the hair out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truely think this is a beautiful wig, the color the feel, it&#x27;s all great, but every &#x27;rose has it&#x27;s thorns&#x27;. I will be email-ing the sender to try for a replacement. If I can, I will update this review with their service.</li>
    <li> The colour is great. Looks like the picture. It&#x27;s very long, especially on me, since I&#x27;m tiny. The heat resistant part is true. I tested my straightener on a few strips. Looks a bit silly on top, but that may just be my head. Looks great with a beanie or any other kind of hat. Sometimes if the bangs are at a weird angle, the netting from the cap shows. It&#x27;s good though. I&#x27;d recommend it for someone who just likes to play dress up at home and stuff. I don&#x27;t cosplay or anything. But I think it would work, as long as you can get it so that the netting doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
    <li> Very pretty! The bangs are a little shorter than the picture but the wig was made well :) Happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I really like this light blue wig. The bangs are not hard to manage and if you put a head piece with it it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful &amp;#60;3 I got a lot of compliments on it when I went out in public. Sorry for the weird photos but my husband and I were having so much fun in the wigs!</li>
    <li> Really pretty, soft and wavy. Unfortunately also quite thin in the back. I&#x27;ll probably have to hair spray it to make sure the back stays in place and the wig cap doesn&#x27;t show through. But for the price, not bad.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and doesn&#x27;t tangle too badly.  Awesome color.  Very realistic.  Easy to style</li>
    <li> Probably the best wig ive ever bought. so soft and easy to brush. i defiantly recommend it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! I am going to use it for my Sapphire cosplay from Steven universe and it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Buy it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think just do because it&#x27;s a fantastic wig!</li>
    <li> Very few tangles, with a light color a white wig cap would be best. Very soft, very easy to split. I got the blue and it looks very similar to it&#x27;s picture. Only complaint is it was abit difficult to put on</li>
    <li> People think I really colored my hair .. This is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheds more then other products I have but that&#x27;s the price you pay for fake hair . It&#x27;s fun ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wear with a hat  makes it seem more realistic . Breaks up the bold color ...</li>
    <li> Overall the wig is great, except for the curls...they get tangled really easily and as soonas I pulled it out of the package the  curls started to lose their form, I&#x27;ll probably end up straightening it later on.</li>
    <li> Very nice cosplay wig, and, like I&#x27;ve said, beautiful for a $12 wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO BE AWARE OF:&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are swept to YOUR left when you have it on.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are LONG and do need TRIMMING if you&#x27;d like to see.&lt;br /&gt;The curls TANGLE easily, so have a wig brush ready.&lt;br /&gt;The NETTING shows in a couple places, meaning you have to move around the hair sometimes to make it all look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a fabulous wig for the price, and I recommend this for not only cosplaying, but casual use as well.</li>
    <li> I love this wig, especially the color. The bangs are a little strange and require styling but over all it is wonderful. It is not shiny at all and fits very well. It might not fit if you have a larger head though. I have a small&#x60;medium sized head and it fits snug but well without adjusting it any.</li>
    <li> It took a bit to get to my home, which wasn&#x27;t expected for a wig shipping from the US! It wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle though, and got here about 3 or 4 days after I had it ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powder blue, which may be a bit duller than the picture entails. That wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, as it&#x27;s cute nonetheless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only big criticisms are that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The curled ends are nearly impossible to brush with the methods I know. They fray and I end up having to pat them back down in order to get the stray hairs back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The cap is a bit small and doesn&#x27;t really grip on unless you put the wig on backwards, then turn it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a really quality wig, and I&#x27;d recommend it for those looking to wear it as-is. The curls are different lengths to get that dollish effect, so those who want to braid it should probably look for a different wig.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t trust the pictures. I ordered what they call light blue, where the picture shows a desaturated royal blue color. Instead got a baby blue/sky blue color. Not even close!</li>
    <li> Love this wig! The bangs are a bit awkward at first but with a little styling it&#x27;s not an issue. The color is an icy blue/periwinkle and very pretty.</li>
    <li> i am gonna be a mermaid goddess..yay me</li>
    <li> Pros: the most amazing periwinkle color I&#x27;ve seen. The curls were soft and length was just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: horrorfic shedding and even worse wefting. Probably the most poorly constructed wig I&#x27;ve bought in the last three years.</li>
    <li> This wig was very good. I got a lot of compliments. Except the bang I styled to go the other way. But it was 5 stars to me.</li>
    <li> It was a decent wig for the price and accomplished what i needed but it was very bright blue- not the pale plue i was expecting</li>
    <li> Really soft and luxurious. Bring some bobby pins though, because the front bangs really will hang down quite far and obscure your vision. Really nice quality wig for the price though. Oh, and it does have an adjustable strap built in so you can tighten it to fit your head.</li>
    <li> This was a really good quality wig for the price. (we bought it for Halloween) It cam packaged nicely in a fishnet bag and had an extra tension hook in the back that made it fit my 8 year old or me!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> The hair looks so amazing.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this wig. It is rather long but nothing a good pair of scissors can&#x27;t handle. If you like it that long keep it! It looks great that way also and is very soft for the price.</li>
    <li> was packaged nice and arrived right away i used it for my Halloween costume i loved it! fit great.</li>
    <li> This definitely met my expectations!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re definitely getting what you pay for with this wig.&lt;br /&gt;The styling is lovely, with soft waves that are very pretty. However this wig is VERY thin, to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t wear it unless I had a hat or some other accessory covering the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;Also note the description of the wig construction- this is a &amp;#34;classic cap&amp;#34;, meaning you can&#x27;t sew wefts into it if you were considering sewing two of these wigs together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is also slightly darker than pictured, which meant I couldn&#x27;t used it for the cosplay I was planning. I&#x27;ve sent this to the back of my wig drawer as I&#x27;m not sure what use I&#x27;ll be able to get out of it- I&#x27;ll probably end up taking it apart and making wefts to use with a different wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, I&#x27;d honestly spend an extra $10 or so and go with something else.</li>
