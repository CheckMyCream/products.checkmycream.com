<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. I am super impressed with this brush! First off, straight out of the package, it was SO soft. Seriously, like brushing the world&#x27;s most adorable kitten across my face (but don&#x27;t worry, the brush is vegan friendly so it&#x27;s not ACTUAL kittens). Now you&#x27;re probably saying, ok enough with the kittens, how does it work? Well let me tell you two things: 1. Never tell me enough with the kittens. Like, ever. And 2. This brush works like magic. I used it with NYX matte setting powder. The powder went on perfectly, it had a very natural look and blended like a charm.  Now, full disclosure I did get this brush as part of a promotion so I did not pay full price, but honestly, I would pay full price for this brush. Feels amazing and gives a really nice, natural look. A great brush that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush has the softest bristles! It feels luxurious and hold the makeup well.</li>
    <li> I received the kabuki brush and had an opportunity to try it out.  I have a very positive review on this brush.  What I liked was its softness and the fact that the bristles stay in the brush.  I have thrown out expensive, yet cheap quality brushes that lose bristles during application and found that to be disappointing.  This brush held the mineral powder makeup very well and applied it evenly on my face without leaving any bristles behind.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of the brush and will absolutely recommend this product on Amazon! I think this brush truly performs better than others I have purchased.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:df132ef8a3d34b4116453c039c2ea4a8]] I did a video review to show just how soft and \\&quot;usable\\&quot; this brush is. I did receive this brush at a discounted rate for my honest opinion on the brush. Trust me...I have used enough makeup brushes to tell you this one is worth the full amount!!!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this brush. It is well made, the handle feels nice and solid. The bristles are by far the softest I have ever felt. The shape of the bristles is also unique and allows for nice coverage of product. I used it with powdered concealer and it held the powder nicely and applied it evenly. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal make-up brush!!!!! Not only is it the softest brush I have ever used, but it is very full and of obvious high quality!  The bristles are secure and the handle fits perfectly in my hand. My foundation has never looked better! I highly recommend the Rose Gold Short Handle Kabuki Brush....it was an excellent purchase and certainly one that I would have expected to cost significantly more money!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is so soft and my blush went on so smooth and even. This is my new favorite brush. I plan or ordering my daughter and nieces one as Christmas gifts/stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> Having worked as a Beauty advisor at a high-end retailer for more than 15 years I was accustomed to quality products. The Rose Gold Handle Kabuki Brush is soft, we&#x27;ll made, no &amp;#34;loose ends&amp;#34; flying around &amp; effectively smooths foundation.  A lot of WOW packed in a small package.</li>
    <li> Excellent construction easy to work with</li>
    <li> I received my Rose Cold Short Handle Kabuki Brush  fast and efficiently. I was very  pleased to see it arrive so quickly as I was eager to try this brush out. I was not disappointed. Upon removing the brush from the packaging I first noticed that the brush was still in perfect shape, it was not all smashed and the bristles were not bent from the shipping. I found the bristles to be extremely soft. The brush picks up and holds the product nicely, application is flawless. No shedding was seen while using this brush. I am very impressed and look forward to continually using this product.</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing i would highly recommend this to anyone the brush fibers are very soft yet dense enough to use a with a powder foundation</li>
    <li> I Love this brush! It is the absolutely best brush I own... It glides so easily on your face and it is very smooth, unlike some others that are rough on your skin.</li>
    <li> I recieved this approximately a week ago. So far I&#x27;m loving it. I use it for my loose powder foundation it applies extremely well. I love the softness of this brush. I would highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product! I have a few cheaper brushes at home that don&#x27;t feel NEARLY as soft as these bristles. It is literally heaven on your face. The bristles couldn&#x27;t be softer and more gentle on sensitive skin. When applying foundation, it evenly spreads the powder across my face and blends everything very nicely. I was a little worried that this brush would be like all the others, but I can honestly say I have never had a brush that does the job like this one AND feels nice doing it. I would recommend this brush to everyone who is looking. With all the brushes I have had over the years, I promise you, you will never find another one like this. I will be buying another one, in the larger handle size as well. The short handle is great, especially for throwing it in your makeup bag and traveling with it. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I ordered under a promotion and it arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.  I have used a flater brush to apply liquid foundation and I did try it, but it didn&#x27;t seem as effective with the liquid.  I used it for my powder mineral compact and it was nice for that.  It is very soft, fit nicely in my hand and packed into my travel kit very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been more excited to get a package.&lt;br /&gt;This package came a day early and had my new kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;First I&#x27;m not a total make-up kind of girl.  I like what I like and tend to stay with what I know works.&lt;br /&gt;I was need of a new Kabuki style make up brush as mine after many washings and many years of work had Finially died.&lt;br /&gt;I found this one on amazon and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s amazingly soft...light weight....and spreads my face powder perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;It does say best with the loose powder but I like to push the envelope so I gave it a shot with my blush....which is pressed powder....the brush did great. ....I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> I received my Rose Cold Short Handle Kabuki Brush in the mail last night. The shipping of this product was fast and efficient. I was very surprised and pleased to see it arrive so quickly.  Upon removing the brush from the packaging I first noticed that the brush was still in perfect shape, it was not all smashed and the bristles were not bent from the shipping. I found the bristles to be the softest I have ever felt. I compare it to feeling kittens fur. The brush picks up and holds the product nicely, and leaves it on my face flawlessly, no streaks or heavy patches of makeup. The strands of bristles are firmly attached, no shedding was seen when using the brush.</li>
    <li> This is truly the softest brush I have ever used!  The first day I just brushed it on my face without any make-up. I used it with powder blush this morning and it was smooth as silk. Would definitely recommend!  I&#x27;ve had this brush now for for more than 6 months and it&#x27;s my favorite!  The bristles are so smooth and soft.  Powder blush blends so easily!</li>
    <li> I just tried my brush and I&#x27;ve got to say it is the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I used it for my loose powder and it worked flawlessly!!&lt;br /&gt;Definnitely worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I received my brush last week and was anxious to try it out.  I have to admit, I was taken back at first because it is small but it makes up for it in the quality of the brush and application.  I loved how the Kabuki Brush picked up just enough foundation and blended exceptionally well.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands of application brushes from $ - $$$ and I have to say I truly love the feel of this brush.  Since it&#x27;s only been a few days I will update again in a few weeks to advise how well the brush is holding up.  I am very confident I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;the brush&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Received my Rose Gold Short Handle Kabuki Brush.&lt;br /&gt;Love the short handle, so easy to hold, and the Vegan fiber brush is soft it is like brushing my skin with a feather!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little kabuki brush.  The bristles are smooth and glide over your face like silk. The short handle makes it great for travel.  On the go, I can apply a very quick and natural look with mineral foundation, then move onto a light cheek contour and lastly a little blush - all with the same brush!</li>
    <li> When I received this brush I was immediately impressed with the softness of the vegan bristles. This brush has a great weight to it and is very ascetically pleasing. I first used this brush to apply a powder mineral foundation. The brush picked up the powder and distributed it very well and evenly. The next day, I applied a liquid, serum type foundation with great results. Both times, I felt that there was great, even coverage with minimal effort. I felt that both types of foundation were easy to blend with this brush. I have used several different types of makeup brushes before and this is my new favorite. I will never, and I mean NEVER, use a non-vegan brush again. This one is beyond soft and durable and being cruelty free is very important to me.</li>
    <li> Very soft.... Love it, works great</li>
    <li> Package came a day earlier than requested which is awesome. Packaging was perfect, the bristles did not come destroyed like they have been in the past via another vendor. The bristles were smooth, I combed through them with a finer comb and nothing came loose. This brush is excellent for powder foundation, NOT liquid. With the powder foundation my coverage was flawless and blended well. I received compliments all day and people wanted to know if I changed my foundation. Nope, just my brush :)</li>
    <li> I am not much of a make up girl I must admit. But I love the new mineral make up &amp; I love this new Kabuki brush. It is so soft but it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder. So I get that soft natural look with this brush. I love it&#x27;s travel size too. I&#x27;m hoping it will be easy to clean.For those that want a good Kabuki brush without spending a lot of money this one seems like it will be great. I wasn&#x27;t able to pull out the bristles easily which is a good sign. It has a slight odor like the plastic bag it came in but otherwise nothing offensive. I do wish it came with a little pouch.</li>
    <li> Love this, best brush ever!  Use bare minerals and have tried many brushes.  They worked fine, but this one is awesome!  Coverage of makeup wonderful, love the shape of brush and it is beyond soft!  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great makeup brush!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using a short handled brush initially, but was pleasantly surprised. It is really comfortable to hold and apply foundation with.  I use this brush with my mineral makeup and I&#x27;d say it gives a more even airbrushed finish than the bare minerals brushes I&#x27;d been using before.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was skeptical about this brush as others I&#x27;ve used before always come with great reviews, but then the bristles always end up falling out immediately. The first thing I did when I received this was run my hand through it and see if anything came out. To my surprise it all stayed in and then I did a little tug to see and again nothing came out. I then went ahead and applied my powder as normal and I have to say this brush is great! It evenly distributed my make up and actually covered up any issues I was having with my face. This brush is definitely my new favorite and I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love this little fat Kabuki make up brush, it fits my small hands perfect, and it&#x27;s so soft. Thank you for a great brush.</li>
    <li> I love pretty much everything about this makeup brush! From the color of the handle to the softness and length of the bristles, I have no complaints! It also seems like it will hold up for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Love it! Puts mineral foundation on so smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is the softest brush I have ever used.  It just glides over my face.  This is a wonderful product, and I&#x27;m glad I could review it.</li>
    <li> I got my kabuki brush 3 days ago. I love it. I have used it each day for my mineral makeup application and it is the softest brush I have ever used. The bristles are tightly packed for great coverage but still incredibly soft. This has become my favorite makeup brush.</li>
    <li> I received this brush 2 days ago and I love it! It is so soft and has become my new favorite! It applied powder very evenly and makes my skin have a smooth finish. You have to get one for yourself...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received my Andre Lorent Professional Kabuki Brush and I LOVE it!  It is very pretty with the rose gold handle and the brush is perfect, very soft and a great shape for powder application..  I would have to say that this brush is the best I have ever used and will purchase it in the future. It is also reasonably priced for the product quality.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush has soft bristles and they don&#x27;t fall out every where.  Work great to put your make up on, would definitely recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Right after taking this item out of the padded envelope (that&#x27;s right - not a big, bulky box!) I knew I was going to love this product!  The brush was just the right size to fit in the palm of my hand, but big enough to do the job.  The bristles are unbelievably soft - so soft I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it!  It picked up my foundation beautifully, and blended very very well.  I would highly recommend this brush to anyone in the market for one, and may pick up a few more myself for gifts - Christmas will be here before we all know it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush and received it the next day! I always thought a brush was a brush when it came to makeup application but this is totally different than anything I have ever used. I have never felt such SOFT bristles, you just want to brush it around your face because it feels that good!  I used it with my  face powder as well as my setting powder and loved it. Just enough product on the bristles and transferred to the face without falling off. Very easy to blend. I love the pink color and the fact that it is vegan. I couldn&#x27;t find it this morning and turns out my daughter had &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it, guess I will be needing another</li>
    <li> This is by far the nicest, softest make up brush I have ever owned.  The powder adheres perfectly and brushes evenly and smoothly. Feels good when I apply powder and blush..  I would say that no makeup brush is worth $50 but after using this for a little under a week, I may have to change my opinion.  I don&#x27;t believe I can go back to using my &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; one.  I also like the short handle better that using a long one.  Packs nicely.  Very impressed with this product and I didn&#x27;t expect to be.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush is FABULOUS. The bristles are incredibly soft and provide excellent coverage. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good Kabuki brush that provided full coverage with soft bristles, and I&#x27;ve finally found it. The brush held my makeup very well, and none of the bristle shed. I&#x27;ve used many different makeup brushes before, and they often claim to be soft and shed-free, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case. With this brush, I&#x27;ve finally found a brush that is super soft and shed-free. I can&#x27;t wait to put my makeup on again tomorrow because this brush is super soft and feels incredible on my skin! I HIGHLY recommend this makeup brush!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush 2 days ago, and received the brush yesterday. Super fast shipping! The best thing I noticed is that this brush is super soft. I used it with my powder foundation, and it works great! It made my face feel as I barely had any makeup on.  Will definitely use from now on!</li>
    <li> Just received this brush today and I am in LOVE!  I can&#x27;t believe how soft the bristles are!  This will definitely be replacing my current foundation brush (which was not cheap).  The qualify of this brush is so much better.  I really like the angled brush head for getting the foundation in all the places other brushes won&#x27;t.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use powder foundation and had been using the Bare Minerals kabuki brush prior to trying this. The Andre Laurent brush has a slighly more pointed tip (attached picture for comparison)  and much softer bristles. I&#x27;ve honestly never though a brush could be so incredibly soft! The Andre Laurent brush seems to pick up a bit less powder and spread more lightly and evenly than the Bare Minerals, although I have always found the Bare Minerals to be effective. I really liked the natural, even, light look (and feel) from the A.L. brush, however, and am definitely planning to stick with it!</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my face. I purchased this for my travel bag but am making it my everyday brush.  It is is so soft and applies my powder foundation really well.  I have used several make up brushes and this is the softest one by far.</li>
    <li> I am loving this brush. The first thing I noticed when it arrived is the quality. I could tell this is a well made brush taht with proper care will last a very long time. The brush is extremely soft which had me a little worried because normally the softer the brush the more makeup it absorbs before being applied to my face. I was happily surprised that this was not the case. So far I have used it to apply mineral foundation and setting powder. It has worked beautifully each time. It is so easy to use and feels great on the skin. It is now my go to brush. I will be expanding my collection of these brushes as soon as I can.  Another great thing I love about this brush is it travels wells. I received it the day before I went out of town and it held up great in my bag. It doesn&#x27;t shed like some cheap brushes and this one is thick. What can I say I love it and it is now my go to brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is super soft &amp; makes applying fountation piwder easy with an even application.  Tge shirt handle makes it easy to use also.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, lightweight, and the perfect size for my makeup bag (not too big or too small.) What I love most, is it doesn&#x27;t leave little hairs all over your face after using it like other brushes sometimes do.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!!!  Very easy to use, and so soft.  When I first got it, I could not stop brushing my cheek.  My daughter gave me a strange look, and I handed it to her.  Her eyes got huge, and she ordered one!  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great brush perfect size shape and density.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush. I used it to put on blush and bronzer. It picked up the powder quite well&lt;br /&gt; It was very soft against my face. Just wish the handle was longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush now for a few days and I can honestly say this is hands down my favorite makeup brush ever. I have been using it with my mineral face powder and bronzer and the coverage I&#x27;m getting is amazing. The brush is so soft and I love the control I get with short handle. The brush is worth every penny and I can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
    <li> The glide of the bristles over delicate facial skin is so soft. The bristles were my concern and this Kabuki brush passed all my tests! Brush is able to hold on to the facial powder with ease and also was able to hold enough powder as to cover my whole face.. The shape of the bristles glides over facial curves and is easy to get into the small areas around the nose. I was skeptical about the short handle. I was able to grip handle comfortably and the length was not noticable, I really prefer the short handle. I am excited about getting the whole line of the Kabuki brushes! 5 Stars</li>
    <li> The brush is super soft and offers great coverage. It has been used several times already and doesn&#x27;t shed. It also is very good quality and seems very well put together. I plan on getting a lot of miles out of this brush. I honestly didn&#x27;t have any negatives for it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Andre&#x27; Lorent products!  The brush is everything that they promised!  Their customer service is prompt and helpful.  I also love the eye creme that they produce and sell!  Great company!</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH! This is the softest makeup brush I have ever owned. I want to buy all of them now. I love how small it is, so I can keep it in my purse! This brush is better than my super name brand ones that I own!</li>
    <li> Very well made. Softest bristles I ever felt.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I have always used inexpensive makeup brushes.  I thought they did an acceptable job, but I decided to try this brush since the reviews were so great.  The first thing I noticed was how SOFT the bristles are.  I cannot believe the difference!  I tried using it with my powder foundation, and at first I felt like it just wasn&#x27;t getting enough powder on it.  It was using way less powder than my old brushes.  I decided to finish applying the foundation, and was pleasantly surprised that despite the little amount of powder used, my face looked good.  It blended really well.  I like to use a smaller brush for my blush, but again used this brush to blend everything at the end.  I am very excited with how well this lovely brush works!  The size is great as well.  I will definitely buy this brush again.  (But I don&#x27;t think that will be for a long time.  This brush is well built!)  :)</li>
    <li> I love the brush. It&#x27;s even softer and more luxurious feeling than I expected. I like the color and the size of the handle. Some brushes that I have feel like they poke my face if I don&#x27;t have a good enough angle on the brush but I can push these bristles straight on my face and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. The brush came a little bit squished in the package but I fluffed it back out. Makeup application went went, distributed nicely. Overall great brush!</li>
    <li> Great sturdy brush that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This brush arrived sooner than expected. It is well made and so soft. Love the rose gold handle. It&#x27;s so nice I don&#x27;t even want to use it. Definitely worth the price so I will be ordering more. My powder glides on so smoothly and super soft so it doesn&#x27;t poke my skin like some brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Received it faster than anticipated which was a huge plus. Also, was received in a nice little padded envelope instead of a bulky ugly box. Was concerned maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be in the best condition because it did not have the box as protection as far as appearance and keeping the bristles nice but I took it out of the plastic and ran to my room to do my makeup! Effortlessly picked up product, applied to face and blended amazingly. And can I just mention how INCREDIBLY soft it is!? I just want to brush my face with it forever! I feel like I&#x27;m being snuggled by 20 kittens, it&#x27;s fabulous! Additionally, I love rose gold so it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this adorable little brush!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am a makeup fanatic and often worry about the quality of the brush because sometimes they pick up a LOT of product but don&#x27;t transfer to my face so it is a waste of my makeup and a total lose. This brush picks up the right amount and transfers all to my face so I don&#x27;t feel so guilty about wasting it or losing any of the expensive powders I use. The size is also convenient and ideal for traveling (which I will definitely not do without this brush!).&lt;br /&gt;Will be recommending to my other makeup-obsessed friends! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I received the short handle Kabuki Brush at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I used the Kabuki Brush to dab on wet foundation and then used a circular motion to blend it in. There is ZERO streaking with the Kabuki brush and it blends flawlessly. See photos of my chin breakout: pic 1: NO makeup; pic 2: wet foundation application with the Kabuki brush and pic 3/bottom shows real results/final after using the Kabuki brush. I waited to post my review to see how the Kabuki brush held up. A professional makeup artist would love the Kabuki brush (as would the average consumer) because the brush has stayed soft (the makeup has not changed or hardened the bristles), I have NOT lost a single bristle from the Kabuki brush with almost daily use (and it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks). I think ANY makeup wearer would be thrilled to add the Kabuki brush to their collection.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Easy application for face powder. Make up goes on smooth and even.</li>
    <li> The softest makeup brush I have ever owned.  It works so perfectly by picking up all the powder in the brush so there is a lot less waste. The Kabuki Brush gives me a flawless complexion.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the shape! Nice size for a purse.</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for about a week now and  it is, by far, the best make up brush I have ever used. The bristles are very soft and close enough together to deliver your foundation smoothly and evenly.  I have even used it to spread my liquid makeup. It worked wonderfully to even it out and prevent streaking.  I have recommended it to both my sisters.  great buy!</li>
    <li> I thought the brush would be a nice gift for my adult daughters.  I decided to open it out of its package because it looked really nice.  Well, the girls can get their own as I&#x27;m keeping it. It is softer than you can imagine.</li>
    <li> Its soft; easy to hold and works great with my loose face powder. Great for travelling too.</li>
