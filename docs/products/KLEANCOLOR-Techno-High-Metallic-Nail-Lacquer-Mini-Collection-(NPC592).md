<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Must admit that the colors are cute but don&#x27;t be deceived by their size, each bottle of polish is 5ml small, here I post a picture of their actual size compared to the regular 15ml KLEANCOLORS polish brand. Don&#x27;t get me wrong here, but I just think that it would have been also worth seeing the product description size on the product picture as well.</li>
    <li> The colors are absolutely awesome! They look good even with one coat. For this price, it is a great choice!</li>
    <li> I love them all and so does my daughters. The only one that might need 2 coats is the yellow one but the other ones dont need it. They have a beautiful metalic color to them that looks really pretty, even the brown. My little girls love them too.</li>
    <li> I searched for nail polish and got this not realizing it was a lacquer.  I didn&#x27;t even open the box and was hit with an awful toxic odor.  These will be going straight in the trash as amazon/the seller will not even let me return it.</li>
    <li> This colors are very nice ,but they fool me cause the nail polished are very small I though they were going to b bigger like a normal nail polish</li>
    <li> The colors are very good, but! You put one layer and you had all the fingers dirty, as the brush is not good. In addition, it takes a lot to remove it even by a strong nailpolishremover.</li>
    <li> the Polish scratches easy and comes off after about 2 days but the colors are pretty just not as metallice as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> These nail polishes are wonderful!! Beautiful colors with one coat!! One BIG warning... You need alot of nail polish remover and it will spread onto your fingers. I used a Q-tip to be sure it does not get on my skin. But to me thats worth it for the BEAUTIFUL long lasting, one coat color!! &lt;3 Thank You Klean Color!</li>
    <li> Although the color options for this set are lovely, I can&#x27;t believe how badly my real nails are stained! I used the pink color and noticed when the polish started chipping that my real nails looked pink, not just a little bit but as pink as the nail polish!  It&#x27;s been almost a week since I&#x27;ve taken the polish off with acetone and my nails are still stained hot pink. My sister had the same problem, but she just painted a different color on top to cover up the stain. I am unable to put a darker color on to cover up the stains because of nursing school. Not happy!</li>
    <li> Bought as  Christmas gift but seems to have very nice colors</li>
    <li> Nice colors but much smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> This is an awesome buy and I absolutely love them! They are a bit smaller than regular bottles of nail polish but such a better deal than them. I have spent over 5 bucks on one bottle of metallic paint here I get multiple bottles for that price. The polish goes on smoothly and looks great. It only took one coat for it to cover my nails and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or lines even with just the one coat. They look perfect and the colors are stunning.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast and look great.</li>
    <li> Beautifully bright colors. These even show up nicely when used to decorate on darker background colors.</li>
    <li> Love the colours and it&#x27;s just so convenient, since it&#x27;s a mini collection so you can travel anywhere with it</li>
    <li> I really picked this collection because I liked the colors. The bottles are small but that&#x27;s not really a bad thing for me. Most of the time, I won&#x27;t finish regular sized ones anyway and they will sit around forever until they get thrown away, still half full. The color saturation is really outstanding for only needing one coat. The back of the product says &#x27;long wearing and chip resistant&#x27; but I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it that and it&#x27;s not the easiest to clean off with remover but overall, I enjoy this product and would buy other kits from Kleancolor.</li>
    <li> Love these polishes the colors are fantastic and they can fit in your purse they are a great buy</li>
    <li> Great colors! Very vibrant and fun. ;)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this !!!&lt;br /&gt;I have bought alot from them only had a few problems but they fixed it immediately,very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> The colors are wonderful. I ordered this because I needed new colors and wanted to try them out. I just they made these in bigger bottles in sets like this.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, wonderful quality. I would no doubt buy this item again in the regular sizes. The color shows up great and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> The color selection is very cute.  It has a variety of metallic colors that are perfect for Winter wear.  The only thing that bothered is how \\&quot;mini\\&quot; the bottles really are.   I would say you could probably get 5 uses out of it. I guess for the price its worth it, but I was hoping they would be a little bit bigger bottles.   But overall very nice selection of colors.</li>
    <li> We totally like this item, and it showed up on time, in good condition over all. the only reason i am giving it a 3 star and not a 5 star is that the Black showed up dried :/ the other colors were fine but the black was pretty much empty and dried out inside. i am not sure why?</li>
    <li> I was hoping that the bottles would of been a tiny bit bigger since they are a tad little but other than that the group is fine. The lacquer does take a bit long to dry but the colors do last and do not chip off easily.</li>
    <li> I really loved the colors I got, and I did receive pretty fast, BUT when I took the polish off, my nails were stained for a very long time. I guess if you dont mind that...they are ok.</li>
    <li> I like it but polish comes off so easy doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> The colors were very bright! It says they are chip resistant or whatever but after about 10 handwashes they would chip and flake.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my boyfriends sisters.. they are really cute and tiny but the fact that they have many colors makes me happy. I hope they  like the as well. Shipped within a week of the order. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Again, I love kleancolor polish. I think the colors are always amazing. The only problem is that they stain the nails. Honestly that&#x27;s not a huge problem for me because i use them mostly to stamp with and do other nail art. The colors are perfect for art. This set I purchased as a gift for a friend and she loved it!</li>
    <li> It will match my clothes</li>
    <li> Awesome the colors are great</li>
    <li> so i was so excited when i purchased it, however the bottles ARE VERY small!! the nailpolish chips the very NEXT day... and when u remove it, it gets all over ur hands and even colors ur nails. i contacted the seller about the issue but all he said was that it was MY fault and refused to assist me. will never buy another thing from them again. terrible experience.</li>
    <li> This is great. All you need is one coat of the polish, you don&#x27;t need 2+ coats. The colors come out shiny and pretty. I don&#x27;t know about you but I tend to get nail polish on my skin and it looks disgusting but with this the brush is so tiny it&#x27;s so much easier to apply. The bad side is that the brown color came chunky. I shook it up but it was old. Kinda sad considering I got it so quick. If this happens to you just add water in the bottle. It turns out better. Overall this is a great polish</li>
    <li> Daughters loved them.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the ease they go on the nails with, absolutely love the mini size and the price was a great bargain, I only wish they lasted a bit longer on the nails, they started chipping by the end of the day, I did my nails early in the morning used base coat and clear coat to seal and they still chipped :/ other than that issue, super cute! Will save them for a special event or something like that, they&#x27;re great for a one day wear.</li>
    <li> I love the metallic look and they don&#x27;t chip. They are small polish bottles but with your choice of 6 for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> These mini bottles pack a punch of bright, fun, metallic color that is so pretty to look at and fun to apply.  These are as good as any nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever used, despite the inexpensive price.  They go on nicely and stay forever, as long as you use a good base and top coat.  My favorite is the blue color...so pretty...looks like the ocean.  I am so enchanted with that color, I really have not tried the others on my nails.  But I expect the same great coverage.  Except from maybe the yellow.  You probably need several coats for that.  But definitely worth the price, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as listed. Polish was bold in color and looked great on. Great color selection. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ts is exactly what i wanted it dries fast and looks nice and doesn&#x27;t peel off like some other little nail polish sets</li>
    <li> The nail colors were all very true to color, I only needed one coat for the color to cover my nail. I love kleancolor nail polish, they have a new loyal customer.</li>
    <li> KLEANCOLOR Techno High - Metallic Nail Lacquer Mini Collection - most of these were crusty old or too thick ..just threw them away  except for the pink and purple...</li>
    <li> It came quickly and the colors are fantastic! I read other reviews about how they stain your nails, but all colored polishes do that so I always use a base coat. I used the turquoise and purple in an ombre design and it is beautiful!  I have had it on for 4 days and it is just now starting to chip just a little (with a top coat over it).  A little touch-up and it looks like new!  I also read complaints about the smell.  It does smell a little different than regular polish, but it was&#x27;t bad at all.  It didn&#x27;t bother me.  I will definitely purchase more colors..and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> These colors are beautiful. My grandson approved as well, he choose the first color I tried and it was a beautiful metallic purple. It was a mirror finish was so shiny that you really did think you could see your reflection in it.  These are truly remarkable colors.</li>
    <li> OmG! My friends love this! The colors are amazing. I have only used 3 colors thus far. The purple is my favorite and gets a lot of attention. I just love it!!!! But the containers&#x27; are soooo small...I wish it was bigger. It chips within a couple of days, so you do have to keep on applying to keep it in tact:(</li>
    <li> Love the colors!! The shipping was fast and everything was as described. Definitely my new favorite nails polish and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors!</li>
    <li> Priced just right,  Color are perfect - product is of good quality. It was packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;My grand daughter was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Fast shipping very reasonable price will buy again</li>
    <li> I got this for my Grand Daughters stocking. She is now allowed to paint her nails for fun. I love this set. It has Beautiful colors. Great seller, good ship time considering usps. I will be buying more from this seller. thank you</li>
    <li> Nice colors no problem with packing and would recommend. Bottle size was smaller than I expected. I would ask person before I recommend this product because although you get 6 bottles they can go fast due to small size. Product was received in excellent condition. Colors are OK.</li>
    <li> I like all the colors in this set, especially the teal and the purple as those two colors are hard to find in my local stores. However, this is some of the slowest drying nail polish that I have ever experienced! The majority of the nail polish I own dries in 20-30 minutes but this takes upwards of 45 minutes sometimes and I do not apply it thickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am not sure if I got some defective brushes or not, but on two of the colors the bristles are stiff and have a tendency to fall out while painting my nails. This causes me to have to start the whole nail over because removing the bristle dents the polish. These two colors also do not apply smoothly, instead they are rather rough applications and not at all pretty and smooth like they should be. It is a minor irritation, but still an irritation none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all they are good polishes and they do stay on very nicely after they finally dry completely.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazing and very bright. USE A BASECOAT! DO NOT PUT THEM ON BARE NAILS. I read that in another review and shrugged it off...well it stains your nail! I then got the joy of walking around with pink tinted nails that looked super weird. They go on thick and cover perfect with only one coat. I love this set.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the KleanColor nail polishes (i have just about every color). I love all of them, and there was three out of this set that i wanted and i am definitely not disappointed in them either. I do wish they would make the metallic brown, metallic navy, and metallic jungle in the full size bottles though.</li>
    <li> I like all the nail colors. I just don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t last long and it stars chipping off right away.</li>
    <li> Cute and stylish colors, but polish was very thick and hard to apply. It may have been old.</li>
    <li> I like the color an it drys fast an it is not messy an it is not hard to open</li>
    <li> believe the word mini... although small i LOVE the colors i love kleancolor nail polish, i&#x27;m planning on getting the large set they sell soon</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my stepdaughter and know she loved the selection of colors. This product was delivered in a timely manner and was what I expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> IF you love metallic colors these are foe you. The shine and the colors are just amazing i love them they stand out and are just the amazing colors you can have on your nails. I would try them if i were u.</li>
    <li> This nail polish stays on great and looks wonderful. One drawback, always use a base coat because the color will stain your nails and has to wear off in a week or two.</li>
    <li> the colors are wonderful! very bright. Makes a wonderful gift. this is the only color of nail polish I have used since I got it! I highly reccomend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Long lasting but be sure you use a good base coat. Otherwise it stains your nails and or toenails</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this for a while, we&#x27;ll I wasn&#x27;t disappointed the colors are vibrate an just beautiful when I painted my nails, I would definitely recommend this if you love painting your nails like I do.  Love love love 👍</li>
    <li> The colors are amazingly vibrant! Perfect travel size too! I&#x27;m serious the colors are super bright. Well worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> loved all the colors, the only downer was that the purple color was goopy I tried to save it because it was actually one of my favorite colors out of the selection but there was just no way.</li>
    <li> The product was as stated BUT it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple hours, chips easy, especially after washing hands!</li>
    <li> I wish they were as bright as the picture shows but they are still cute. Makes a great gift. On time shipping.</li>
    <li> Polish is a bit too thick I had to use a thinner first in order to use this for my water marbling</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more happy with this purchase. The colors are very bold and the polish gives great coverage. I actually bought this set to put into goodie bags for my cousins along with the neon collection. Problem is, I ended up liking them so much I kept most for myself and had to buy more! Great quality and pretty colors. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap. It has a toxic smell to it. it does not last long. Do not use it for kids.</li>
    <li> All except the gold work well for stamping. These are very pigment dense, and will stain your nails if you&#x27;re just painting your nails with them. A good base coat is a must! For nail art purposes, I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> The polish is super thick &amp; brushes are too big for the bottle.</li>
    <li> Sent these as a gift and she loved them!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, glittery/sparkly, pretty colors. I have only tried the purple so far. It is difficult to remove with nail polish remover though, perhaps more so than with normal nail polish colors.</li>
    <li> Came late Had forgotten I ordered it.. So instead of giving it to my grand daughter.. I kept it myself.. I had gone out and got her nail polish from a store.</li>
    <li> One of the nail polishes was opened and not properly packaged. The others were nice. Pretty&lt;br /&gt;colors, but a lot smaller than expected. Well when they said mini i guess they meant it.</li>
    <li> great colors look fantastic on your nails</li>
    <li> Nice quality polish. Goes on smooth. Chips after a few days. The bottles are on the smaller size, but not tiny by any means. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Flakes off way too easily. The colours are pretty vibrant though.</li>
    <li> excellent quality product. Recommended 100% to the entire community. The product is as described. Therefore I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Only one coat of polish is require, but it chips and comes off hours after applying. The colors are pretty....that&#x27;s about.</li>
    <li> I really liked the colors of course the bottle was smaller than I expected .but its good because in case I gotta take them in my purse well they will fit perfectly! I got them before I expected which is great!</li>
    <li> Loved the mini kit as it was a gift for my daughter and she love it as well......fast, friendly shipping! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> good size for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Nice colors but you can see the difference between this brand and others more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This one for the price I think is ok if you want extra colors to complete your collection.</li>
    <li> Love all these colors.  The bottles are very tiny.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazing!  Opaque in just one coat! Be careful not to get it on your skin as it does stain. I wait for it to dry before removing off of skin. Great price and shipping was fast. Have gotten many great compliments. Will be buying the full size bottles.</li>
    <li> for it to be chip resistant the polish always chips as soon as i put it on. very disappointed in it but like the colors.</li>
    <li> These are great nail polish.  I gave them as a Christmas gift, and they were a hit.  I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Really nice selection of colors which allows me time to decide if I like them on me.  I do, so will order again.</li>
    <li> Vibrant color but beware, they are super tiny. But the colors are pretty though. Came fast.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small they were but pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Bright colors, easy to apply, quick drying. Great gift</li>
    <li> These are mini nail polishes, so they are good for anyone, even kids! The colors are excellent and very pretty. I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to order this product and time it came in, I applied the nail polish.  However I must say I&#x27;m highly confused as to why putting on a topcoat (Sally Hansen) made the polish change colors.  I applied the metallic pink and on one hand applied the topcoat and the pink is now fuschia.  So I now have one hand with metallic pink nail polish and the other with fuschia nail color.  The nail polish is not chip resistant as after the polish dried I went from my couch to my car and in a matter of 5 minutes, my polish chipped.  Will not be ordering this brand ever again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be bigger or more stable for the price, I find it very suitable, extremely bright and full colored, sitting well with a top coat, and you only need 1 layer to get a full coverage. I am satisfied. And the colors are crazy!! :)</li>
    <li> Nice vibrant colors! Smell is a little over whelming.</li>
    <li> Sweet colors. I love them very nice however the bottles are super mini, it b nice it they were a bit bigger</li>
    <li> This made a great gift set to finish my Christmas shopping. My niece loves her nails painted and likes to use different colors. She was very happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> Just before ordering this pack, I spent more than this whole pack was worth on a single bottle of nail polish that I ended up hating. That polish took forever to dry, smudged, and the color was barely there. It was a disaster, and I was very frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that experience, I decided to give up expensive brands for a while and try some cute inexpensive polishes. I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I love this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful and vibrant. It does take a bit of time to dry, but it&#x27;s not as bad as many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves the sparkles. I will buy this brand again for sure.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing price is so cheap yet the nail polish is great quality I totaly recamend it.The colors are really pretty and great for fall :)</li>
    <li> I have not used this product because I bought it as a gift but I believe my girlfriend will like it.</li>
    <li> Could smell them even through the bubble wrap packaging they came in. But the color was really good just a little smaller than what I expected but worked good enough for my little nieces who liked them.</li>
    <li> All of these colors are great! My favorite is the pink :) One coat of polish is enough to cover your nail so a little goes a long way.  I have no complaints about this product.  Oh, shipping was fast and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty. However I only received one third of my order. Goes on smooth. Was going to give as gifts to students, but the party time came and went without the rest of the product. Metallic shine is nice. Hope I don&#x27;t get charged for the whole shipment.  Nice, full sized bottles.</li>
    <li> My daughter realy loved getting this for Christmas,she loved the colors,she loved how nice the colors looked,how bright they are.</li>
    <li> Bought this for granddaughter and as i said before she loves this nail polish good buy!! it is something that young girls like</li>
    <li> reallly shiny and mettalic. drys fast looks great i love these they&#x27;re super cute. id recommend  them for the price.</li>
    <li> Not really what I had expected or what I was looking for.  Seller was great and packaging also was good.</li>
    <li> I wanted these polishes to be the \\&quot;bomb\\&quot; but unfortunatley they were not, i mean the colors were great but the application was not at all smooth, polish was too thick, even after a few \\&quot;shakes\\&quot;, even though they were in little bottles, dont get me wrong, i like \\&quot;klean colors\\&quot; but i would rather purchase larger bottles with longer brushes, maybe i wont get that \\&quot;thick\\&quot; presentation. Oh well, better luck for me next time!</li>
    <li> Cheap nail polish that chips off fast. My be good for young girls</li>
    <li> Colors are very nice, but the polish stinks. The smell is gone the next day. Polish does chips very quickly.</li>
    <li> what can you say bad about finger nail polish?  it was fine. Was a gift, small bottles, but it tells you the size i think, so good deal :)</li>
    <li> Their tiny but cute which is perfect for me since I don&#x27;t wear nail polish often. The colors are beautiful! I honestly think for $5 this is seriously very good nail polish. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip (so far)!</li>
    <li> I knew they would be small but they&#x27;re not THAT small. They&#x27;re the perfect size. Bigger than a regular mini.&lt;br /&gt;Pigmentation: excellent. One coats enough to get the color that&#x27;s on the bottle without adding multiple layers.&lt;br /&gt;Does it chip?: day two and not so far.&lt;br /&gt;When it dries its metallic and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and don&#x27;t regret the purchase. Metallic are in for the for the spring so im good.</li>
    <li> smaller bottles than expected, but I like them small since I never seem to use even half of the bottles before they get too thick/old.  Colors are great and bold, only one coat is necessary and I love that!  Time saver!</li>
    <li> I bought these for perfect little stocking stuffers (I took off a star becausw they are very little) but on a personal note I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever finished off a single bottle of nail polish (except for topcoat) before it gets goopy and old anyway, so if you like a lot if cheap color variety the size isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought they would be cheap quality requiring a lot of streaky coats but to my surprise they hold a lot of pigment in them and I only needed one coat or two VERY thin ones. So, great buy!</li>
    <li> The colors are awesome.  i only pyut one coat on it is significantly chipped but i do dishes and such so that is to be expected.  did not realize they were mini sizes and I have three girls so I am guessing it will go quick but totally love the colors.</li>
    <li> Love these! They go on smooth and bright on the first coat, and it comes off easily with remover. I put top coat on and it lasts a good length if I want to keep it on.</li>
    <li> Love the colors but the bottles were too small, was expecting the normal size bottles i would normally buy at the stores...</li>
    <li> I gave them as gifts and the colors are so much in style, The girls loved them and I loved the awesome price!</li>
    <li> Love these! Goes on smooth and u only need 1 coat. The bottles were alot smaller than I wanted but I should of looked at the size b4 buying so its my fault lol. It arrived alot sooner than I thought it would</li>
    <li> Came a week early. Every single color is as I pictured. If you like metallic like I do this is a steal.</li>
    <li> I received my order almost a week earlier than expected date! I was surprised how quick it was shipped out to me. The nail polish is alot smaller than expected. For the actual size, I would have to compare the bottom of the nail polish to the size of a quarter. This is not including the entire length, only the round bottom part. The length would be about the size of a toothpick. I must say the colors are so rich in color and beautiful. I absolutely love the colors. It was worth it. And it was only $4. Not bad at all.  Only one more thing I have to say is that if you are a beginner, I would be extra careful because it stains very quickly. If you get some polish on your skin, wait for it to dry completely before removing it rather than it still be liquified and will smudge more. Be sure to have a base coat on before any and all nail polish application followed by a top coat. Also have extra cotton balls/pads and nail polish remover for this nail polish as I said before, it will stain if you do not properly remove it. Once your done with your nails, I promise it&#x27;ll be worth it!  I will defiantly be buying more products and more nail polish from this seller as I had a great experience with everything. 5 star!! :)  Xoxo Summer</li>
    <li> Love this mini-set! As expected, the bottles are small, but that&#x27;s exactly how I like my nail polishes, so I don&#x27;t get tired of them. As the others said, one coat is all you need - it covers beautifully. It doesn&#x27;t really chip all that quickly. Usually, nail polish starts to chip on the 2nd-3rd day, no matter how \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; it is, but this one holds wonderfully, especially for dark colours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brushes are indeed very bad (that&#x27;s why 4 stars). It&#x27;s tough to get the side strokes where you need them and how you need them. As to the staining the nails, all polishes of vivid or dark colours do that, that&#x27;s why I always use a base coat.</li>
    <li> Those colors are amazingly beautiful.Just breath taking if you love the metallic effect!! I may order more,it&#x27;s arrived on time.Didnt take too long at all.Id definitely choose this Mini selction because it allows to get more for your buck!!! Get it if you&#x27;re a DIVa like myself.Its worth it!!</li>
    <li> this is very gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood color combination................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its really worth to buy this item.its small gift for your loved ones.i got it with in three days.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!! This is my second purchase of this brand and the colors are vibrant and don&#x27;t chip as easy as other polishes.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and last a long time. The pink and yellow are perfect for summertime and the darker shades are great for fall and winter.</li>
    <li> Sorry I purchased these.  They were dried up.  I gave them as a present and was embarrassed when they were opened..</li>
    <li> After purchasing, I read the reviews of this Kleancolor Nail Polish and was a little worried.  Reviews state how the polish tints your nails &amp; skin for a long time.  I tried canceling order but it was too late.  I rec&#x27;d it and opened the package to a very stronge nail polish odor.  One of the bottles, Yellowish-gold, was broken and had leaked into the box and packaging.  Another cap on a bottle, Blueish-green, was cracked and had the blueish-green nail polish on it.  I wanted to send it back but I only paid $6 for this set; 0 shipping, so it would have cost me more to return than to just keep the bottles that were not damaged.  I tried one of the colors and it was awful!  The color itself is pretty and it goes on well but yes, you need at least 2 undercoats so that the nail polish doesn&#x27;t practically permanently color your nails and a lot of cotton balls &amp; polish remover to get off.  Also, while doing your nails with this Kleancolor (funny name considering) you have to wipe off any that gets on your skin IMMEDIATELY or you&#x27;ll be stuck with it for a couple of days.  Terrible purchase!!!!!</li>
    <li> They stain. Like really, a lot of staining. Use sparingly and make sure you use a base and top coat to avoid staining and chipping. Love the colors, hate the stain.</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about how highly pigmented Kleancolor polishes were-and it&#x27;s all true!  I bought these polishes expressly for nail stamping and they work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that these are &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size-5 mL each.  That is slightly bigger than a &amp;#34;Bon Bon&amp;#34; polish (4 mL) and smaller than a &amp;#34;Sally Girl&amp;#34; polish (5.3 mL).  For the nail stampers out there it&#x27;s the same size as the mini Konad polishes that come with the kits.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a friend. She LOVED the colors and they went on very smoothly. I liked the price and the fast shipping. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! The colors are as pictured, and are even, arguably, more pretty in person! The polish is very high quality, one coat is plenty for beautiful, even coverage! The package arrived in a timely manner, which I didn&#x27;t expect because usually things with free shipping take FOREVER to get here! I would buy this product again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bad quality The nail polish peeled, I&#x27;m very upset</li>
    <li> Pretty polish, however difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> This was another gift for my daughter. I had expected the color to be more bright but when on its kinda dull and chips really fast. I guess it serves the purpose. Kinda watery..</li>
    <li> Vivid.  Lasting color.  Unique shades.  Tons of compliments.  Inspired me to begin building my collection of full-sized bottles in these shades, as well as others.  I wish the Metallic Navy were available in full-sized, but it is only available within this gift set so I sub with metallic charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> these are great you only have to use one swipe and it covers the whole nail and shiny enough you don&#x27;t have to use a top coat.</li>
    <li> Ordered the nail polish on August 9th, still have not received it.  E-mailed the company and I got no response.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these were mini collection, lol. I just clicked and bought, but I wish they were bigger! :) It&#x27;s okay though I still Love them, because KLEANCOLOR is such an epic brand! Love them!</li>
    <li> i love the colors, rarely chips but a lil hard to remove!  pure acetone always does the trick without to much work</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as an add-on gift to a manicure set.  The colors looked very bright and I liked that their were so many colors in a small package.</li>
    <li> These polishes are great but really, really smelly. Perfect coverage in 2 coats. Fast-drying. I gave this product 4 of 5 stars because of the smell. I would buy this product again. I would recommend this product. I payed $5.75 and free S&amp;H handling when I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> Great color options and covers well. It lasts well without chipping easily also which was really nice. I was concerned when I bought it but have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome formula love it! GReat to stamp with!!</li>
    <li> Too good to be true...you get what you pay for!  I thought the price was due to the smaller bottle size,  but it&#x27;s apparently because it stains your hands and is impossible to remove.  Three layers of the pink and it was chipping like crazy the next day.  2 days later it chipped even more, so I decided to try and remove it.  The polish will not come off cleanly and my nails and fingers are stained.  Horrible!</li>
    <li> I thought that these colors would be really dark due to them being metallic, but they are a really nice medium high gloss color.</li>
    <li> These are some beautiful colors and they look even beautiful on your nail plus top it off with a clear top coat. Ooooh my god gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier than expected, bonus.. The colors are bold, bright, smooth, and shiney! I love them!! Thank you for the amazing deal</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful but the nail polish itself is kind of thick. Not just from this seller but the brand itself. I have pastel colors that I bought from a local beauty supply and the grade was the same. I love the crackle on top of these colors and I love to paint every other nail on hands and feet a different color.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful colors. To bad they dont last long, they chip very easily.  Also the darker colors will stain your nails.</li>
    <li> Good quality cute colors.</li>
    <li> It stains the s*** out of your nails. I will never use the ones I have has a regular polish, only as a minor accent over another one, it&#x27;s that bad. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the colors are vibrant and pretty, but it&#x27;s not worth the permanent stain on your nail.</li>
    <li> awesome colors, just dont stay on long, chip a lot, especially on the tips. arrived after the holiday. was still okay.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love the metallic colors. Bright and fun! It is kind of clumpy but I just added a tiny bit of water and it thinned it out perfectly.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my neices and am so excited for them to use them (once they open them after christmas). They look like great colors...</li>
    <li> love the collection,..my nails are looking so cute in these amazing colors!!</li>
    <li> great stuff, the girls love them</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good product.</li>
    <li> very pretty colors make my nails shie like never before</li>
    <li> Not bad. I like the colors</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd mini collection from Kleancolor &amp; even if I can only purchase 1 polish every month, then that&#x27;s what I will do. The colors are awesome. Even the yellow nail polish is actually yellow. Most times u buy yellow nail polish &amp; you have to apply 3-5 coats &amp; it still doe not look right.  KLEANCOLOR is now My Favorite Nailpolish ever.  I will acquire all their Mini Collections because I think the tiny bottles are so cute &amp; I&#x27;ve purchased them for less than $6.00. My nxt purchase will be the Neon Mini&#x27;s, can&#x27;t wait to see how pretty &amp; bright those colors will be.</li>
    <li> The colors on these nail polishes are great. They are long lasting and look bright and shiny. I really love them.</li>
    <li> Good products at a great price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she likes some things and others not so much, she loves the shiny color, it&#x27;s quick to dry but the only problem is that it chips fast. overall she likes it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited for these to come but then when I painted my nails the color in most of these was nothing like looked in the bottle :(</li>
    <li> dries fast and goes on smoothly and looks great has a pearly sheen to it-I was complimented many times while wearing this polish-great look!</li>
    <li> Kleancolor completely surprised me. I ordered it because it was cheap and pretty colors. The colors are sooooooooo bright!! they shimmer just enough and the polish drys fairly quickly. Kleancolor is my new fave!</li>
    <li> The package came fast and in good shape and the colors were very nice, but two of the colors were dried up when I opened them. Otherwise good</li>
    <li> I love the colors and it lasts a long time without chipping, but the bottles are super small. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a full size bottle because of the description, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be that small.</li>
    <li> most of them are real great some are thick and I had to thin them out with nail polish remover</li>
    <li> These colors are great! Bottles are small but I don&#x27;t mind. Cant beat the price. Only con is that the metallic pink stained my finger nails. Doesn&#x27;t have that effect on toes nails though. Still love it!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. It takes one coat to get ones nails done, yes  they are a tad small but I loved it anyways. It also smells a tad funny but I think it&#x27;s because of the stuff they used to make it metallic.</li>
    <li> These cover like few other brands. This means the small bottles last longer. They have such a nice brush as well. While they are small, I like that bc the small bottles won&#x27;t dry up. Thx...</li>
    <li> was a birthday gift very cute set nail Polish bottles are very small but beautiful metallic colors overall was pleased and the person I got them for loved them</li>
    <li> good product. works great.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. My girlfriend loved them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> they are beautiful colors, i love mixing them all together. very cute small bottles, that&#x27;s what i expected. i love them.</li>
    <li> Product just as described and arrived very timely, can&#x27;t wait to give as a stocking stuffer for my girls who love nail polish!</li>
    <li> These colors are very catching to the eye. The polish is smooth and last for days, wish the bottles were larger.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not to buy this, but considering the price, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal if it didn&#x27;t turn out perfect. When they say \\&quot;mini\\&quot;, they really mean miniature, but the colors are very pretty and the polish is overall good quality. You&#x27;d expect these polishes to be cheap quality because they are inexpensive, but the consistency is perfect, and it is easy to apply and easy to remove. These polishes lasted about a week before they chipped. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> Love the colors almost all only need 1 coat of polish for full coverage they are very shiny and rich colors. They work well for stamping</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift.  I found that it is as they said. came very fast.  I would recommend to you</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> I received my pack of beautiful metallic Kleancolor polishes in the mail with the highest of expectations. I knew I was getting quite a bargain, but I had done my research and the reviews spoke so highly of the brand. When I used one of the colors on the first day, I was blown away by the amazing color!&lt;br /&gt;However, my amazement was quickly extinguished when I went to wash my hands a few HOURS later, a lot of the polish started CHIPPING off the ends. This happened with my best top coat on. After the end of the second day, half the polish was gone off of a few nails! I was so frustrated at the look of my unkept nails, I decided to remove the polish. After a few brushes with acetone, I noticed my nail beds were STAINED bright pink! No amount of remover was getting this off! It was only after a few more days when I removed some polish I had covered my pink exploded nails that it started to finally go away.&lt;br /&gt;That experience has really deterred me from using any of the other beautiful colors unfortunately. Given the chance, I would NOT buy their product again. It just does not stand up to the quality and strength of other polishes.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my toes. its long-lasting. great shine love the colors and for the vaule even better!! I love that you get so many choices for the price also</li>
    <li> these are really small bottles. When i purchased this item I thought it was going to be the regualr size nail polish bottle. So when I received the package I was a bit disappointed but that was my fault for not reading the description. Overall the product is still really good.</li>
    <li> It is very good I advice everyone to buy from this one it is the best and I will buy from him/her again and again</li>
