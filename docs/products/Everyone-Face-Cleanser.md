      <li>Very happy with</li>
      <li>the best way I can describe is that &amp;#34;Noxema&amp;#34; scent.  </li>

      <li>Great stuff if you chemical peel or microdermabrasion.</li>
      <li>This product works great -</li>
      <li>Great value for the money</li>
      <li>So happy with it.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Very nice moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Sensitivity wise, this lotion did not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>very smooth and oily feeling , perfect after a shower, before bedtime , can&#x27;t wear in morning because weathers too hot</li>
      <li>I LOVE this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand of soap and body lotion</li>
      <li>but my face does feel smoother and more moisterized.</li>
      <li>and I have a reaction to so many things, but my skin loves this.</li>
      <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or alcohol on the ingredients list.</li>
      <li>At night, I sometimes add a drop of avocado oil to make it more rich.</li>
      <li>I still gave it 2 stars because the bottle was huge for the price</li>
      <li>The ingredient list is fantastic, including argon oil.</li>
      <li>skin stays smooth after the usage</li>
      <li>It is a light moisturizer in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s not bad and doesn&#x27;t even linger.  </li>
      <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not totally unpleasant once it dries, but I could not use this on my face.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think this lotion would be best suited for someone with skin that tends to be on the dry side.</li>
      <li>The price is great and it&#x27;s not one of those dinky little one ounce bottles for $25 that you would find elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>A good friend and luxury hair stylist explained something to me about hair-care products which I apply to many such things: organic and natural products are better for your body overall</li>
      <li>I have used many other products from EO and enjoyed all of them.</li>
      <li>Compared to Neutrogena this is likely 10x better in that regard.  </li>
      <li>I did notice the \\&quot;sweating\\&quot; on a hot day when I first put it on</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t need much though!</li>
      <li>The smell is light and the feeling is not heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s huge and gives you far too much product.  </li>
      <li>and I rarely get a breakout and my afternoon oiliness is better than with any other product combo.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re generally not anywhere near as effective as some chemicals.  </li>
      <li>It was inexpensive yet contained great, skin-loving oils like Babassu, Argan along with skin softeners and anti-oxidants such as Mango Seed, Oat Beta Glucan &amp; Green tea extract.</li>
      <li>After three weeks, my skin has responded really well.</li>
      <li>This lotion is working out very well.  </li>
      <li>Really works well and helps repair damaged skin.</li>
      <li>During the summer months, this moisturizer made my face very oily</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I read most of the reviews and saw that it was a natural approach to facial care.  </li>
      <li>I love all of the other EO products.</li>
      <li>It has a great scent and a little bit will go a long way!</li>
      <li>This is a really nice basic moisturizer - I like using it everyday</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any break outs and my skin is very soft</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive combination/oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I tend to not need moisturizer in the summers since it&#x27;s so humid where I live, so I usually don&#x27;t use it all summer, but now that fall weather is hitting, I was glad to have this on hand.</li>
      <li>I use about a pea size amount for my whole face, and it sinks right in and does its job without making my face feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it during a hot northeastern summer and it provides enough moisture without making me shiny.  </li>
      <li>Also, it gives me no trouble when I bother putting makeup on over it.</li>
      <li>I have looked for years for a natural moisturizer (or any one, for that matter)</li>
      <li>I compare this to Neutrogena Oil-free Sensitive Skin lotion which was recommended by my dermatologist 10 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several months and really like how the moisturizer feels on my face.</li>
      <li>It has a natural herbal smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week so don&#x27;t really notice the benefits</li>
      <li>My skin is so sensitive</li>
      <li>I am in my 30s and still break out and have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>For all natural, that&#x27;s what you deal with and</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last, and I&#x27;m used to natural products smelling natural</li>
      <li>that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or oily, and doesn&#x27;t contain anything I&#x27;m allergic to (fragrance, certain preservatives, and lots of other things).</li>

<li> A few people wrote about how aweful it smells.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s such an awful scent to me, and very powerful.</li>
<li> Made me breakout like mad, and why so much ylang ylang eo?</li>
<li> sucks -</li>
<li> I have not had any weird blemishes or sores since I started using this which is usually a sign that it is not agreeing with my skin.  </li>
<li> hate the smell and does not moisturize enough.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this for months. Great stuff if you chemical peel or microdermabrasion.</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews and saw that it was a natural approach to facial care.  I am in my 30s and still break out and have sensitive skin.  I am a red head.  I have tried everything. Noxema, Oil of Olay, Proactiv, Clinique you name it.  This lotion is working out very well.  A few people wrote about how aweful it smells.  Seriously, it&#x27;s not bad and doesn&#x27;t even linger.  For all natural, that&#x27;s what you deal with and the best way I can describe is that &amp;#34;Noxema&amp;#34; scent.  I have not had any weird blemishes or sores since I started using this which is usually a sign that it is not agreeing with my skin.  The price is great and it&#x27;s not one of those dinky little one ounce bottles for $25 that you would find elsewhere.  Very happy with it take my word for it.  I have suffered enough for you to believe!</li>
    <li> Came unsealed, and spilling out. Had to discard. I still gave it 2 stars because the bottle was huge for the price</li>
    <li> I use it as my aftershave. So happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice basic moisturizer - I like using it everyday and I use the Face scrub once a week.  The Face moisturizer lasts a loooong time because you just use a tiny bit each time.</li>
    <li> When this arrived I thought that I&#x27;d been mistakenly sent body lotion because of the bottle size and type of dispenser, but the product is definitely just for faces.  I&#x27;m using it during a hot northeastern summer and it provides enough moisture without making me shiny.  Great value for the money and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or alcohol on the ingredients list.</li>
    <li> very smooth and oily feeling , perfect after a shower, before bedtime , can&#x27;t wear in morning because weathers too hot then i&#x27;m sweating this oily stuff off</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.  My skin is so sensitive and I have a reaction to so many things, but my skin loves this. It has a natural herbal smell. Clean and fresh. The ingredient list is fantastic, including argon oil.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin that can sometimes be a little oily. During the summer months, this moisturizer made my face very oily so I started using it as a hand cream--it makes a wonderful hand cream.  Now that it&#x27;s fall and the weather is starting to change, I may try to use it on my face again as I usually tend to dry out during the fall and winter. Sensitivity wise, this lotion did not irritate my skin. Overall, I think this lotion would be best suited for someone with skin that tends to be on the dry side.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of soap and body lotion so I wanted to try the face lotion as well. The smell is light and the feeling is not heavy or greasy. It does leave my face tingling for a bit after application, but I have sensitive skin so that is not uncommon. I haven&#x27;t had any break outs and my skin is very soft so I would definitely suggest giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I compare this to Neutrogena Oil-free Sensitive Skin lotion which was recommended by my dermatologist 10 years ago.  I have very sensitive combination/oily skin.  This product works great - it wears well and if anything I&#x27;d say I slightly prefer this to the Neutrogena even though it is ever so slightly heavier.  It is a decent value (twice the size for less) compared to Neutrogena.  I did notice the \\&quot;sweating\\&quot; on a hot day when I first put it on but that&#x27;s likely just a reaction to the heat and the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump on this thing sucks - it&#x27;s huge and gives you far too much product.  If you want to close-screw and lock the pump for travel, an unusable portion of product is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentions a toxic chemical in this product.  Compared to Neutrogena this is likely 10x better in that regard.  It doesn&#x27;t claim to be organic or made from fairy dust, it just looks that way.  A good friend and luxury hair stylist explained something to me about hair-care products which I apply to many such things: organic and natural products are better for your body overall but they&#x27;re generally not anywhere near as effective as some chemicals.  This is after all a beauty product; we&#x27;re cheating the effects of time and therefor nature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week so don&#x27;t really notice the benefits&lt;br /&gt;yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin stays smooth after the usage so I will continue to use the moisturizer..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and really like how the moisturizer feels on my face. It has a great scent and a little bit will go a long way!</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer. Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product in the summer and found that after I applied it, my face would sweat.  I really don&#x27;t sweat much at all so that felt weird.  I love all of the other EO products.</li>
    <li> personally, i don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the smell and does not moisturize enough.</li>
    <li> I have used many other products from EO and enjoyed all of them. So, when I saw their facial skin care, I picked up the toner and moisturizer. It was inexpensive yet contained great, skin-loving oils like Babassu, Argan along with skin softeners and anti-oxidants such as Mango Seed, Oat Beta Glucan &amp; Green tea extract. After three weeks, my skin has responded really well. It is a light moisturizer in my opinion. At night, I sometimes add a drop of avocado oil to make it more rich. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the overall fragrance. It could be a mix of the black tea ferment, calendula (which always smells earthy to me) along with EO&#x27;s of lavendar and bergamot that make up the odd aroma. It doesn&#x27;t last, and I&#x27;m used to natural products smelling natural so I accept it.  Ingredients include: Purified Water, Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Vegetable Glycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Sorbitan Olivate, Organic Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Cetyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Palmitate, Cetyl Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Quinoa Protein, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Oat Beta Glucan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment, Organic Herbal Blend [Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Organic Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, and Organic Camelia Sinensis Leaf Extract], Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Organic Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Allantoin, Centella Asiatica Extract, EO® Essential Oil Blend [Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Foeniculum Vulgare (Fennel) Oil], Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil , Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Beta-Carotene, Organic Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Tocopherol, Sclerotium Gum, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Phytate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyhexylglycerin</li>
    <li> I have looked for years for a natural moisturizer (or any one, for that matter) that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or oily, and doesn&#x27;t contain anything I&#x27;m allergic to (fragrance, certain preservatives, and lots of other things). I have oily skin, but now that I&#x27;m not a kid anymore,I need a moisturizer in the fall and winter. This moisturizer is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much though! I use about a pea size amount for my whole face, and it sinks right in and does its job without making my face feel greasy. I pump a little onto my fingers, swirl it between my fingertips, smear it all over my face, and then massage it in. This way I use just a little and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy. I tend to not need moisturizer in the summers since it&#x27;s so humid where I live, so I usually don&#x27;t use it all summer, but now that fall weather is hitting, I was glad to have this on hand. I use it with the Cerave Foaming cleanser and I rarely get a breakout and my afternoon oiliness is better than with any other product combo. Also, it gives me no trouble when I bother putting makeup on over it.</li>
    <li> Made me breakout like mad, and why so much ylang ylang eo? It&#x27;s such an awful scent to me, and very powerful. It&#x27;s not totally unpleasant once it dries, but I could not use this on my face. I used it on my body for awhile and eventually threw it out. I&#x27;m not usually so sensitive to fragrances, but for some reason that oil is something I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
    <li> Feels a little sticky to me...but my face does feel smoother and more moisterized. For the price i do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Really works well and helps repair damaged skin.</li>
