      <li>great stuff.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is also great for hands and face.</li>

      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Miracle salve does just what it says it does - tames fly aways.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell and good consistency.</li>
      <li>My husband used to keep his beard trimmed to deal with the fly aways and now that he has this he is able to let it grow to the length he prefers!</li>
      <li>works fine, but doesnt smell the best.  </li>

      <li>But, the salve is still good for cracked hands, just not for beards.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my beard with this verses a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>but this product is every bit as great at a better price.</li>
      <li>Also smells nice too.</li>
      <li>Professor fuzzworthy, Beard Balm, Stingray Bay, Honest Amish, etc.</li>
      <li>After using it for 4 days my flakes are gone and my beard has a nice shine and is learning to stay where I want it to be.</li>
      <li>I found this miracle salve to be effective</li>
      <li>Excellent product, I&#x27;m using it daily, goes on great, not oily, and conditions my beard with good results, first time user but will order again!</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;d forget I had it in and would get greasy hands as I can&#x27;t stop touching my own beard.</li>
      <li>id say this is better.</li>
      <li>A much better value than products marketed just for that.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees has a salve specifically designed for hands that provided a much better experience.</li>
      <li>I use some in my beard to make it more comb-able.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love it.  </li>

      <li>It offers excellent control with just the right amount of pliability.</li>

      <li>Otherwise it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>it might feel a little greasy at first after putting it in but use a 100% boar bristle brush and it will look great and feel great.</li>
      <li>It adds a nice shine to my beard, but doesn&#x27;t looks greasy [unless you use too much].</li>
      <li>Keeps ma beard shiny and heading in the right direction!  </li>
      <li>Hubbys facial hair looks really good and the hair is not as course.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my husband because another reviewer said it was good for his beard, as good as the more expensive beard salve.  </li>
      <li>Nothing seems to tame all of my stray whiskers, but this does good for most of them.</li>
      <li>The kind where on a daily basis strangers stop me to comment on it&#x27;s glory.</li>
      <li>Works great for treating dry skin spots that normal lotion will not touch.</li>
      <li>this stuff works great, I use it when my hands are so dry that they sting with normal lotion.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and makes my beard very soft and manageable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about 1/5 the price of a beard product I recently bought by the time you factor in how much more product you get.</li>
      <li>Just make sure not to touch anything until you wipe the palms of your hands off, especially paper</li>
      <li>I am very very excited about finding this product, but not for the same reason as everyone else.</li>
      <li>I have tried 2 other types of beard specific wax/paste or what ever, and this does the best job of taming the wild hairs.</li>
      <li>alot cheaper than the other trendy beard products</li>
      <li>there is really no reason to buy a more expensive beard balm when this does the trick perfectly.</li>
      <li>The price is a fraction of the cost of any other product and offers superior hold.</li>
      <li>good for the cuticles and extra dry spots.  </li>
      <li>I have a very substantial beard.</li>
      <li>and the shipping was really fast.</li>
      <li>Like others have said it doesn&#x27;t take much to work.</li>
      <li>I really purchased this item for moisture under my beard, it did just that.</li>
      <li>It looks very shiny</li>
      <li>Not much of a smell and easy to apply just don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
      <li>I melted mine down with setting it in some hot water, stirred in some essential oils of my own.</li>
      <li>but I used it with my first pregnancy &amp; among searching the ingredients I found out that it has exactly the same ingredients as this miracle salve!</li>
      <li>and your hand feel like new.</li>
      <li>There is really a very light smell and the texture and small amount needed does the trick</li>
      <li>I have super dry and cracking hands during the winter and within a week of using it every night before bed, my hands are no longer cracking.</li>
      <li>it came very early</li>
      <li>I know it will work for it since the ingredients are exactly the same as in mamma bees belly balm &amp; i</li>
      <li>I recently started rock climbing and found that my hands were getting pretty beat up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other beard balms that are $3 to $5 more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly olive oil and beeswax with other natural oils in smaller amounts.</li>
      <li>The complicating factor in my situation is that I work in a university children&#x27;s hospital and must balance having a  beard of epic proportions and professionalism.</li>
      <li>All natural and can use it all day without worrying about what chemicals are going into my body.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
      <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the product as I only got a couple days use out of it.</li>
      <li>It has just a natural scent to it.</li>
      <li>It really keeps my beard pretty tame all day.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend much, felt other product was over priced.</li>
      <li>It smells a little funny in the container, but has little/no smell once applied.</li>
      <li>Very faint scent, which is a good thing.</li>

<li> A little salve puts a slick feel and shine on.</li>
<li> expensive!</li>
<li> I also have an [incredibly] annoying habit of chewing on my beard</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, and it caused me to break out.  Otherwise it worked just fine.  Just not for me.</li>
    <li> Got this for my beard. I was growing my beard winter length and It was getting unruly. Needed something to help with this as well as &amp;#34;bearddriff&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t want to spend much, felt other product was over priced. It helped, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell. It lingered for longer than I expected based on other reviews. Also, I&#x27;d forget I had it in and would get greasy hands as I can&#x27;t stop touching my own beard.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bearded veteran based on the reviews. There is really a very light smell and the texture and small amount needed does the trick</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husbands unruly beard and mustache. It has a very light scent, really not bad at all. Like others have said it doesn&#x27;t take much to work. Hubbys facial hair looks really good and the hair is not as course.</li>
    <li> I recently started rock climbing and found that my hands were getting pretty beat up.  I decided to try a few products to help them heal including the Burt&#x27;s Bees Miracle Salve.  I found this miracle salve to be effective but my hands would feel greasy for a solid 20 minutes after applying it.  Burt&#x27;s Bees has a salve specifically designed for hands that provided a much better experience.</li>
    <li> I have a very substantial beard. The kind where on a daily basis strangers stop me to comment on it&#x27;s glory. The complicating factor in my situation is that I work in a university children&#x27;s hospital and must balance having a  beard of epic proportions and professionalism. This has led me to try countless beard products. Professor fuzzworthy, Beard Balm, Stingray Bay, Honest Amish, etc. Out of all of these products, Miracle Salve stands out. It offers excellent control with just the right amount of pliability. Tames those stray hairs, softens and conditions, and gives a great shine. The price is a fraction of the cost of any other product and offers superior hold. Miracle Salve is my go to.</li>
    <li> cannot bear this product,I bought it for my beard, price is spot on and has months of use depending on your beard length. alot cheaper than the other trendy beard products but compared to the other waxes ive had id say this is better.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Do It.  Get some Miracle Salve and tame that thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase because it&#x27;s only 2oz. but with the price I figured how can I lose?  This stuff is great.  I was having one of those weeks where I wanted to shave because my beard just made me look haggard and unkempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miracle salve does just what it says it does - tames fly aways.  It smooths out your beard a bit, shines it up, and holds in place.  Been using this 2oz container daily for weeks and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve used any.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I use this for my beard. I have tried 2 other types of beard specific wax/paste or what ever, and this does the best job of taming the wild hairs. Also smells nice too. Very faint scent, which is a good thing. Nothing seems to tame all of my stray whiskers, but this does good for most of them. I just need to keep using this and combing the beard so it will be trained.</li>
    <li> great stuff. expensive!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my beard because my skin was getting dry and it the hair was starting to get a little squirrely. After using it for 4 days my flakes are gone and my beard has a nice shine and is learning to stay where I want it to be. Not much of a smell and easy to apply just don&#x27;t use to much. there is really no reason to buy a more expensive beard balm when this does the trick perfectly. it might feel a little greasy at first after putting it in but use a 100% boar bristle brush and it will look great and feel great. ordered it on a Wednesday and got it in the mail on Saturday.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Stays in all day. I think my husbands beard was softer when he used this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband because another reviewer said it was good for his beard, as good as the more expensive beard salve.  I guess I was envisioning a tame, smoother beard, but it&#x27;s still ridiculously fluffy, only now it&#x27;s also shiny!! Yuck. But, the salve is still good for cracked hands, just not for beards.</li>
    <li> Got this to use as a beard conditioner. A much better value than products marketed just for that. It&#x27;s about 1/5 the price of a beard product I recently bought by the time you factor in how much more product you get. I was disappointed in the beard products because so many are heavily scented with old fashioned scents that are overpowering. This has almost no smell. It&#x27;s mostly olive oil and beeswax with other natural oils in smaller amounts. Obviously good for any skin moisturizing needs and lips as well.</li>
    <li> I use this in my beard it works well and the shipping was really fast. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and good consistency. good for the cuticles and extra dry spots.  I use some in my beard to make it more comb-able.</li>
    <li> I looked for quite a while to find something that would keep my beard from being too unruly. This product works well. It adds a nice shine to my beard, but doesn&#x27;t looks greasy [unless you use too much]. It really keeps my beard pretty tame all day. It smells a little funny in the container, but has little/no smell once applied. I also have an [incredibly] annoying habit of chewing on my beard [I know, weird, right?], and this stuff doesn&#x27;t have any taste.    Overall, you can&#x27;t beat this for the price.    Edit: This stuff is also great for hands and face. I have super dry and cracking hands during the winter and within a week of using it every night before bed, my hands are no longer cracking. It looks very shiny so I don&#x27;t recommend using it on the face before going out. Just before bed or when you&#x27;ll be home all day is great.</li>
    <li> I am very very excited about finding this product, but not for the same reason as everyone else. Burts bees discontinued mamma bees belly balm awhile ago but I used it with my first pregnancy &amp; among searching the ingredients I found out that it has exactly the same ingredients as this miracle salve! So even though it&#x27;s not for stretch marks I know it will work for it since the ingredients are exactly the same as in mamma bees belly balm &amp; im so happy about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it came very early I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get it until next Friday &amp; it came this morning.</li>
    <li> Good for the beard!  Makes it lay down and behave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other beard balms that are $3 to $5 more. This is not a knock against them....but this product is every bit as great at a better price.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to my son, and he loves it!  Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> My husband used to keep his beard trimmed to deal with the fly aways and now that he has this he is able to let it grow to the length he prefers!</li>
    <li> Keeps ma beard shiny and heading in the right direction!  A little salve puts a slick feel and shine on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I really purchased this item for moisture under my beard, it did just that. The only thing I disliked, there was no scent. It has just a natural scent to it.</li>
    <li> I like the what the product but I don&#x27;t care for the aroma. It smells like burnt wax. So if you like the smell of burnt wax give it a try.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great, I use it when my hands are so dry that they sting with normal lotion. Leave on for 10 min. and your hand feel like new. Just make sure not to touch anything until you wipe the palms of your hands off, especially paper you are trying to write on. Works great for treating dry skin spots that normal lotion will not touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my beard for a couple months now. Thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Boy was that a mistake. Broke out in hives on my face after a couple days. Got a topical cream from my doctor to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the product as I only got a couple days use out of it. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my beard with this verses a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought to use as a beard wax.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money because I did not think that I would be keeping my beard for so long.  Anyway, I love it.  I love the slightly sweet smell!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. All natural and can use it all day without worrying about what chemicals are going into my body.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> works fine, but doesnt smell the best.  I melted mine down with setting it in some hot water, stirred in some essential oils of my own.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m using it daily, goes on great, not oily, and conditions my beard with good results, first time user but will order again!</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again for my beard or any other moisturizing purposes.  It does not easily absorb into the beard and has no smell to it.  I prefer other beard specific balms.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and makes my beard very soft and manageable</li>
