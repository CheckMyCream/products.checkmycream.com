<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is awesome for face, hands and nails!</li>
    <li> Smooth transaction, and great product!</li>
    <li> A very light effective oil for dry skin problems, love the pump bottle; I give it as gifts to friends and so far they all ask how to get more.</li>
    <li> As with all Acure products, I love this oil. It&#x27;s very smooth, lightweight and soaks in nicely. I use it alone or mix it with other oils. Used at night it helps with fine lines. I work the extra into my hair. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> vegetable-based oil was recommended to me by my dermo</li>
    <li> I live in a really dry climate and needed something moisturizing that would work well with my sensitive skin.  I use this as a carrier oil at night with my favorite essential oils and just before applying my favorite organic BB cream in the AM.  This is thick and extremely moisturizing without leaving my skin greasy or shiny.  It penetrates after a few minutes, and I&#x27;m ready to apply makeup.  I would never have believed that an oil would have worked for me, but it has balanced the PH in my skin and I have not had any issues with sensitivity or breakouts.</li>
    <li> I am 33 with sensitive skin that breaks out easily if irritated. This product did surprise me by causing breakouts. It helped reduce my blackheads and the oiliness of my t-zone over the course of the day but I developed pimples in unusual places.</li>
    <li> Marula oil is excellent for your face - just 2 drops is more than enough to moisturize your whole face. Absorbs fast and works perfectly under foundation (not greasy). I&#x27;m 51 and love it to keep my dry face looking good!</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to try Marula Oil, but did not want to pay the high prices I had seen. This is great oil. I sent it to my mother, and she likes it too. Reasonable price for a good product.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell.  I use it for face twice a day and hair to prevent split ends. This oil is not greasy at all. I have a normal to oily skin, and I use this marula oil after cleansing as a moisturizer before applying foundation. It works better then any other cream, and it feels less oily than argan oil. I am very pleased with this product and planning to order again in the future.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing I use two drops when my skin is feeling dry I usually use it under my foundation.I got mine for 17$ from whole foods and I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a year now.at first I was scared to put this oil on my face as I have acne prone sensitive skin but I took the plunge and it was well worth it,this product is 100percent marula oil I was in sephora and they had a brand of marula oil for 78$ which for one was NOT 100MARULA OIL THAT oil had other ingredients in it and the cost was 3x as much as the acure.that taught me a huge lesson to ALWAYS ALWAYS read the label for the products ingredients.lastly this oil has some great antioxidants in it for your skin.highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soo soft and good. Errases fine lines instantly. Relieves dryness... very good product</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results of Marula oil.</li>
    <li> It really feels good on the skin.  Not crazy about the smell but if it does the job that is all that matters</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! Leaves my skin hydrated and works well in tandem with my moisturizer. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> I have this oil for about a week. It&#x27;s great when skin is really dry. I like the dispenser. Probably I need to wait little bit for more effects.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I recently moved from Seattle to Arizona and expected my hands to be instantly dry and rough, but I have been applying this at night with lotion over it, and my hands are less dry than they were in Seattle! They feel super soft also. The oil absorbs quickly and is light. It also does well in my hair. My new favorite!!</li>
    <li> For transparency, I did not purchase this on Amazon but now that I know they have it, I will be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine at a local health food store. Other reviews state that the oil has a certain smell. I cannot smell anything when I unscrew the top and sniff the bottle of oil; sometimes if you let oil sit too long it can go bad. Maybe that is the problem? Mine doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all. It&#x27;s suspicious that other brands are charging so much more than Acure. Acure&#x27;s Marula Oil is 100% marula oil (and nothing else), cold-pressed, grown without pesticides, and proceeds to back to the community of women who process the oil. It moisturizes my lips so well: I have lots of scars from years of reconstructive surgery. The oil soaks right in. I also use it on my elbows and hands, and I suspect I&#x27;ll be using it on my face after reading the other customer reviews, and maybe one day on my pregnancy belly! It is fantastic and I&#x27;m very happy with the brand, the integrity and high grade of this oil, and look forward to purchasing my next bottle on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Marula oil. I use this on my face every morning and night. I mix it with my sunscreen in the morning and moisturizer at night. I don&#x27;t wear any type of foundation or powder on my skin so I don&#x27;t know how this would work if I did use those products. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I tend to have drier skin and this really helps keep my skin moisturized. I have gone through three bottles and I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love that this oil is made from marula without pesticides. First of all, there is no scent added to this and this smells like nothing (which is great, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance). I apply a pump of this to my palms and rub my hands to warm it up and pat it into my skin. It absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy (it will if I put on too much). It leaves a dewy finish to my skin but my skin feels light and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see that it has helped improve my skin&#x27;s texture. The redness of my skin is still there but it&#x27;s getting better. I would repurchase this once I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A con that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my bottle came with a pump... not a dropper.... The pump can sometimes pump out too much product, it&#x27;s hard to control how much you get.</li>
    <li> Love this non greasy oil.  Sometimes this is all I use after I wash my face at night.  During the winter when my skin is very dry I use it before night cream.  Love all Acure products.</li>
    <li> I think this oil is pretty good. It absorbs into my skin within 30 minutes and is great under makeup but I have dry skin. The only thing that turns me off is the smell. It&#x27;s like a light sesame oil. I&#x27;ve taken to adding it to a cream moisturizer that has it&#x27;s own scent of lavender. This not only covers the sesame smell but makes the moisturizer so much more emollient.</li>
    <li> Very much like the ordor-free lightness of the oil. However, my eyes got very itchy when it migrated into my eyes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews, but it&#x27;s true! This makes my skin look and feel great and does not break me out! I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since my teens and finally cleared it up now in my thirties using [[ASIN:B00DWGC5PW Clear Skin Vitamin Pack for Acne - 30 Day Supply]] http://www.amazon.com/Clear-Skin-Vitamin-Pack-Acne/dp/B00JAYIHK2/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;08VPK18HV871GXCEJJVA and Bioelelements Acne Clearing Line http://www.amazon.com/Bioelements-Pore-Rescue-Treatment-Ounce/dp/B008F8UVS0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400724426&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;bioelements+acne. I put one squirt of the oil on my face and neck every night and love the way it smells and feels! I will definitely it buy again - although no rush since the bottle seems like it will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> I will definitely reorder this product. Recommend it highly. If you want a wonderful oil for your skin this is it! Full page ad on Marula Oil in July VOGUE.</li>
    <li> I bought this in place of a fancier branded one elsewhere... but this one doesn&#x27;t smell good, and didn&#x27;t produce as good of results.  It also felt like it wasn&#x27;t sinking into my skin very well.  Acure is supposed to a good brand, but I&#x27;ve been let down by everything I&#x27;ve tried from them so far.  I went back to my expensive version.</li>
    <li> I like this oil even better than their argan!</li>
    <li> I have only used for short tome but like it</li>
    <li> I like this oil.  No unpleasant smell etc. but I don&#x27;t feel like it is something I would buy again.  I am not sure it is really doing anything special for my skin.  My skin is softer but as far as aging or wrinkles etc, I really am not sure.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful to find products like this on line!  Such a nice convenient way to have everything dropped off right at my front door!  I love this product, and the seller was awesome!</li>
    <li> Really nice moisturizer for dry skin. I have been trying all the different nut oils to see if they really make any difference vs store bought cleanser and moisturizers. I like coconut oil but it caused little red bumps on my face, worked fine on my body. So I started with the marula oil and the argan oil. These feel so nice on my skin no breakouts, they absorb well but I still feel soft.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great to use daily at night. i love using it around my eye area and my lashes, also my smile lines. it has definitely helped my skin texture improve over time and i see that my skin is smoother (I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have any problems with big pores or wrinkles). i appreciate that this is natural and organic. it&#x27;s moisturizing but i do apply an extra cream on top at night. also, this does not have a scent which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one downside to this product is that it comes with a pump and when you pump it out, a lot of product comes out. if you use the pump method daily, you will run out very fast.</li>
    <li> My skin was breaking out like never before after I stopped Proactiv.  My skin was addicted to Proactiv/benzoyl peroxide.  For 5.5 months my face was a mess.  I tried many things from home remedies such as raw honey mask, baking soda, raw apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil to prescription antibiotics and expensive cream( Skincerity).  All failed until I found marula oil and neem oil.  Marula oil  is a miracle for  my skin.  Since I started using marula oil, I haven&#x27;t notice any new breakouts and the blemishes are disappearing so much faster.  I want to share this. with everyone especially if you are trying to restore your skin.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully!  No notable scent, non greasy, absorbs beautifully, softens ans hydrates!  Love!  Will purchase again and plan to use this oil for a lifetime :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried argan oil and it left my face oily and broken out, while coconut oil left me too greasy with some dry patches. After reading all the great reviews, I tried this marula oil and have been very satisfied.  My skin looks great, I haven&#x27;t broken out at all, and really hydrates. It is virtually odor-free though I&#x27;ve noticed a slight nutty/sunflower seed type smell, which completely goes away when absorbed.  I would definitely purchase again, though I found it slightly cheaper in a health food store.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to rival the argan oil I have been using. Unfortunately, it is a bit sticky and does not absorb readily into the skin, hence the 3 stars. I really wanted to love it since it is unscented and all natural. The price is right, but the consistency just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, like the way live my skin so soft. l try so many of other in the market this is the best.</li>
    <li> Best price on manula oil I&#x27;ve seen. Works better than argan/jojoba/etc.</li>
    <li> I have combination acne prone skin. This works great for me, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s the perfect oil, not too heavy and not too light. Once it soaks in (takes about 2-3min) it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or anything like that. It also has no scent or added fragrance, so great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pump bottle! It&#x27;s much easier to use than a dropper and I don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter I need a little something more with dry skin so I mix this oil with a cream. In the summer/fall it works wonderfully used by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great compared to many other brands selling marula oil. I would definitely repurchase, and recommend to anyone looking to try a high quality facial oil at a decent price! I love ACURE Organics.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective in hydrating the skin and serves as a great base before apply in cosmetics. Since this product serves as the active oil, I put 5-7 drops in my carrier oils (jojoba, avocado, apricot seed) with a few drops of vitamin e oil. On average this oil cost about $8 to mix versus paying $50 or more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t trust this oil! They are some kind of cheap saseme oil not authentic marula oil. Real authentic oil is a green color not yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;Compare with real authentic one at Whole foods or Wild by nature!!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is not at all greasy and it has a very subtle fragrance (just a hint).&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t look oily or greasy (after the initial application).&lt;br /&gt;This oil has definitely helped with my oft dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Plus, it&#x27;s completely vegan -- no disgusting animal parts, secretions or abuse involved.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my skin is glowing and dewy! I used it on my curly hair as well and the curls were more defined and smoother! Will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> Wow.  An oil that is lush, hydrating and doesn&#x27;t break me out!!  Joy.  So worth the price.  Also, very minimal scent for people who do not care for all the strong moroccan and argan oils on the market.  - Colleen</li>
    <li> is okay - no better than less expensive oils.</li>
    <li> product as stated and what I wanted</li>
    <li> Works miracles on my son&#x27;s KP (keratosis pilaris) if used regularly.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality oil; I&#x27;m using it in my homemade moisturizer and my skin is in fantastic shape. I tend to break out with many carrier oils - despite the luxurious,thick feel  - it goes on light and soaks in well.</li>
    <li> I use it nightly on my face, neck and hands.  Terrific moisturizer.</li>
    <li> very good facial oil. It moisturizes your face without making it feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I have heard raves about Marula Oil. I have used it since it arrived. It has helped a little this winter but would not purchase again. I have very dry skin and with -26 degree days this winter I thought it would protect better but has not.</li>
    <li> Not to shabby.  It&#x27;s a lighter oil that I alternated with my vitamin e oil during the summer.</li>
    <li> It is oily when it first goes on but will soon soak in and your&#x27;ll love how soft your skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;No, smell that I can detect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my feet, hair, and hands.</li>
    <li> Love it , will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because I don&#x27;t believe any product is perfect.  I have noticed an overall difference in the fine lines on my face after having used this for a couple weeks.  I normally use it after applying my night cream and concentrate on the areas around my eyes and forehead.  Also I use it after applying my makeup by putting a small drop on my finger, rubbing my fingers together and then dabbing around the outer portion of my eyes and cheekbones.  This really makes the fine lines disappear and adds a wonderful dewy brightness to my face!  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry place and I love how this product hydrats my skin. It is efficient without being too oily</li>
    <li> Absorbs easily into the skin, not greasy, just moisturizing. Use on skin or hair(damp). A little bit does a lot.</li>
    <li> I used during summer time so, I do not know if its worked.</li>
    <li> love it, I use to have a very oily T zone, and now it is gone after a couple of weeks using it, I just don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> Sinks into your skin instantly and makes it soft and plump!  Amazing!  I use this on my hair as well and it makes it soft and smooth and shiny and no frizz!  Wish it came in a bigger bottle because at the rate i&#x27;m going, it&#x27;ll run out very soon!</li>
    <li> Very nice and keeps my skin smooth</li>
