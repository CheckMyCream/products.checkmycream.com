### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Love it!!!!</li>
      <li>It smells DELICIOUS!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it would work perfect for men too, if you don&#x27;t mind the fruit.</li>
      <li>Very, very bright notes of orange and citrus.</li>
      <li>Great to use after shower and as a carry on perfume.  </li>
      <li>and I would happily recommend buying from them.</li>
      <li>A great summer scent.</li>
      <li>This would probably be a great scent to wear to an outdoor party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells great in the sun though.</li>
      <li>have to agree - this is it - the oil of happiness ..</li>
      <li>Think of bright silks like a warm sultry sunset, candles burning in a Moroccan styled lantern and a bowl of figs with honey.</li>
      <li>.. so happy I bought more..</li>
      <li>boyfriend thinks its adorable sexy incredible ..</li>
      <li>embrace your femininity...and enjoy you!!</li>
      <li>Rose and lily of the valley are very...assertive...</li>
      <li>This smells sweet and beautiful.</li>
      <li>This is another scent I liked from Al-Rehab.  </li>
      <li>The best part is, in my opinion, it smells like a $200 high end perfume or Eu de cologne</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and exotic without being overbearing or &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>will say that this, to me, is very strong.</li>
      <li>This one is sweet and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>But its very lovely, and strong and exotic.</li>
      <li>Sabaya paled a bit in comparison with the other two for me (to be fair, Dalal has quickly become a favorite scent), but it&#x27;s still very nice, and probably would work wonderfully for someone more inclined to adore fruity florals.</li>
      <li>Deliciously exotic fragrance.</li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, i&#x27;m glad I took the leap</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments on the scent</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>else it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Okay...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not my #1 favorite, but one I would purchase again.</li>
      <li>While most guys might think - this is too fruity/flowery, not a manly scent at all</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the perfume oils now and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>On the right person, this would be gorgeous.</li>
      <li>The moment I first opened the top and rolled some on my arm, it was exhilarating.</li>
      <li>Item arrived today, and I was so excited to smell it!  </li>
      <li>like something very new clean  and beautiful ..</li>
      <li>If you can wear very sweet florals, it might work for you.</li>
      <li>(7 now to be exact) and liked most of what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty, bright, cheerful fragrance; these aren&#x27;t the notes I prefer in scents, but it&#x27;s grown on me with wear.</li>
      <li>Worth trying, these oils are really nice.</li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast; I&#x27;m quite pleased, and will be reordering!</li>
      <li>The top note of rose really just embraces your nose without being too overpowering.</li>
      <li>Soft perfume is my favorite because it smells really good and sugary.</li>
      <li>Beautiful lasting perfume.</li>
      <li>Let it dry though, and it is simply incredible.</li>
      <li>and.floral.side.the scent.smell fine if you like sweeet smells</li>
      <li>and I enjoy that in a perfume.</li>
      <li>a good everyday smell good</li>
      <li>this oil suddenly brings you to a happy state..would say it smells crispy clean ..</li>
      <li>This particular fragrance I love and glad I took a chance ordering it.</li>
      <li>an aromatic blend which falls somewhere between mild and strong.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me an orange mixed with the warm musky scent of an exotic flower.</li>
      <li>but it s true..</li>
      <li>It is way too sweet for me and just sits on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Is really sweet and girly smell.good</li>
      <li>which is probably true ..</li>
      <li>like somebody mentioned earlier comparing this oil with happiness .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that it layers really well with Choco Musk (I&#x27;m more truly enthusiastic about it with the Choco Musk, personally.)</li>
      <li>florals, and can be overwhelming, and at first, this came close to being a bit too much.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what this is: a true fruity floral; the initial and dominant notes I got were rose and lily of the valley, backed with citrus and a hint of berry.</li>
      <li>Nice, different, sort of like lemon grass &amp; linen soaps combination.  </li>
      <li>so it worth buying 2 or 3 just to get an idea of what works for you</li>
      <li>Since I like to mention what something reminds me of, I will say it reminds me of D&amp;G&#x27;s Rose the One; according to the note lists I found for both, they do have some in common: rose, lily of the valley, lychee, and cassis --</li>
      <li>Smelled great doing it, though.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was VERY fast, I received it much sooner than I ever expected.</li>
      <li>The florals do mellow down, but the notes in it remain pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are cheap, and decent smelling-</li>
      <li>It is not too fruity, not too sweet, yet not subtle scent.  </li>
      <li>perfume is nice, a little sweet but acceptable.  </li>
      <li>This scent is one of my first experiences with this line of perfume oils.  </li>
      <li>There is a bit of citrus fruit that you smell when you first apply Sabaya.</li>
      <li>The overall smell is elegant, refined, youthful and pretty.</li>
      <li>It seems very feminine when in the box, but it actually has this fresh strong note in it</li>
      <li>The first time I globbed it on, it was so much, that I had to shower - I was sneezing nonstop.</li>
      <li>Its soothing, sweet, but fresh at the same time.</li>
      <li>Imagine strolling down your favorite memory, a sense of euphoria and nostalgia might overtake you and make you feel calm, excited about the future, and all at once tranquil.</li>
      <li>Its light, gentle, lingers for almost the entire day.  </li>
      <li>people open their eyes wide asking what am i wearing what smells so good</li>
      <li>My only dislike, is its VERY powerful.</li>
      <li>This is such a soft slightly sweet scent..like chiffon or a whisper..not loud at all.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I like to combine this fragrance with &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; perfume for a new scent.  </li>
      <li>so I have a vivid imagination.  </li>
      <li>love these oils because the scents are long lasting and high quality but the price is so unbeatable compared to similar perfumes.</li>
      <li>Plus, you can easily turn this into a perfume fragrance by adding some perfumers alcohol and letting it sit a few weeks (just a thought).</li>
      <li>Of course, this oil blend will react differently on each person, but it overall as sweet, flowery tones.  </li>
      <li>but my extremely peaky with the perfume  </li>
      <li>I think it really smells a lot like tangerine EO blended with Perry Ellis 360 blue oil and a hint of bergamot, but that&#x27;s just in the beginning.</li>
      <li>I have brought 6 bottles so far</li>
      <li>I think of it as a fragrance for the mature woman...</li>
      <li>I ordered this along with two other Al-Rehab scents (Dalal and Choco Musk); Al-Rashad shipped very, very promptly</li>
      <li>I like this fragrance because out of all of the Al-rehab oils that I have tried so far, this is one of the first I have come across that offers a little bit of an aquatic note</li>
      <li>I have to be careful about how much I put on or</li>
      <li>The fact that it contains no alcohol means that you will be smelling pure fragrance instead of smelling something that&#x27;s been watered down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a small tube, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>

    <li> Imagine strolling down your favorite memory, a sense of euphoria and nostalgia might overtake you and make you feel calm, excited about the future, and all at once tranquil. This oil is just like that. The moment I first opened the top and rolled some on my arm, it was exhilarating. The top note of rose really just embraces your nose without being too overpowering. The fact that it contains no alcohol means that you will be smelling pure fragrance instead of smelling something that&#x27;s been watered down. I wore this throughout the night and woke up with the smell all over my pillow so it definitely has staying power. The overall smell is elegant, refined, youthful and pretty. It&#x27;s floral but not overbearing so it can be worn by men as well. The best part is, in my opinion, it smells like a $200 high end perfume or Eu de cologne so I can vouch for the fact that the price doesn&#x27;t mean lack of quality. It&#x27;s a small tube, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. Plus, you can easily turn this into a perfume fragrance by adding some perfumers alcohol and letting it sit a few weeks (just a thought). Anyhow, i&#x27;m glad I took the leap and I can&#x27;t wait to try another scent attar from this company.</li>
    <li> like somebody mentioned earlier comparing this oil with happiness . have to agree - this is it - the oil of happiness ..weird huh . but it s true.. this oil suddenly brings you to a happy state..would say it smells crispy clean .. like something very new clean  and beautiful ..but my extremely peaky with the perfume  boyfriend thinks its adorable sexy incredible ..which is probably true ..people open their eyes wide asking what am i wearing what smells so good .. so happy I bought more..</li>
    <li> Nice, different, sort of like lemon grass &amp; linen soaps combination.  It is not too fruity, not too sweet, yet not subtle scent.  Reminds me of scented soap.  This scent evolves into softer, less soapy smell.  Sometimes I like to combine this fragrance with &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; perfume for a new scent.  Soft perfume is my favorite because it smells really good and sugary.</li>
    <li> Womanly, flowery, delicate and pretty.</li>
    <li> Great to use after shower and as a carry on perfume.  This perfume last until the next shower.  Romantic scent.</li>
    <li> Hi fellow Amazon shoppers, I&#x27;m here to give a brief review and give a tip to anybody needing it.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is nice, a little sweet but acceptable.  The only issue I have is ; it didn&#x27;t last past 10 minutes on my wrist or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to add this to a very faintly fragranced lotion I bought at one of the dollar stores. It helped to grab the fragrance and help it last.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this on twice doing my little &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; and the fragrance has lasted for several hours. I bought the roller bottle pictured, it&#x27;s eayt to take off, just grab between 2 fingers and pull up from base of roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap, and decent smelling- so it worth buying 2 or 3 just to get an idea of what works for you, you can even mix it with other oils or body creams or shea butter ect... just experiment. If my review has helped click &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of the perfume oils now and this is definitely my favorite. A great summer scent. Very, very bright notes of orange and citrus. There&#x27;s a delicate floral note underneath the orange. It&#x27;s a lovely combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The citrus notes are very heavy, in my opinion so if you don&#x27;t like fruity type scents you probably wouldn&#x27;t like this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this, to me, is very strong. I have to be careful about how much I put on or else it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming. A little goes a long way. Smells great in the sun though. This would probably be a great scent to wear to an outdoor party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these oils because the scents are long lasting and high quality but the price is so unbeatable compared to similar perfumes.</li>
    <li> Just received my Sabaya oil. I LOVE it. It reminds me of a medium perfumy smell. I will order more.</li>
    <li> I admit I was nervous about ordering an unknown fragrance although I have ordered perfume oils from Al-Rehab (Crown Perfumes) (7 now to be exact) and liked most of what I ordered.  This particular fragrance I love and glad I took a chance ordering it. I looked up the word \\&quot;Sabaya\\&quot; and it means morning, the  eastern wind. I think of it as a fragrance for the mature woman...an aromatic blend which falls somewhere between mild and strong.  It reminds me an orange mixed with the warm musky scent of an exotic flower. Think of bright silks like a warm sultry sunset, candles burning in a Moroccan styled lantern and a bowl of figs with honey. Okay...so I have a vivid imagination.  Try it if you dare.</li>
    <li> This is another scent I liked from Al-Rehab.  Its light, gentle, lingers for almost the entire day.  Not my #1 favorite, but one I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This scent is one of my first experiences with this line of perfume oils.  The smell is basically just a &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; scent, that somewhat reminds me, anyway, of the smell of old-fashioned candy orange slices!  Of course, this oil blend will react differently on each person, but it overall as sweet, flowery tones.  A little dab DOES go a long way!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. I have brought 6 bottles so far</li>
    <li> I have received many compliments on the scent</li>
    <li> This smells sweet and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance because out of all of the Al-rehab oils that I have tried so far, this is one of the first I have come across that offers a little bit of an aquatic note and I enjoy that in a perfume. It&#x27;s very refreshing and exotic without being overbearing or &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;. There is a bit of citrus fruit that you smell when you first apply Sabaya. I think it really smells a lot like tangerine EO blended with Perry Ellis 360 blue oil and a hint of bergamot, but that&#x27;s just in the beginning. Let it dry though, and it is simply incredible. I think it&#x27;s like an Aqua Di Gio for men with a unisex flair due to the sweetness of the citrus. If you&#x27;re a woman who is not fond of all the sweety-sweet flower bomb kinds of perfumes and like something sporty and aquamarine, give this a go. I&#x27;d say it would work perfect for men too, if you don&#x27;t mind the fruit.</li>
    <li> This one is sweet and pleasant.  I think it smells like honeysuckle.  That said, I can&#x27;t wear it at all, unfortunately.  It is way too sweet for me and just sits on my skin.  I had to scrub it off and give the bottle away.  If you can wear very sweet florals, it might work for you.</li>
    <li> Sweet...totally feminine...lasting....just a little goes a long way...any of this brand can be bought without hesitation....embrace your femininity...and enjoy you!!</li>
    <li> Is really sweet and girly smell.good i like can wear it for all kinds of  events it a good everyday smell good it is on the.sweet and.floral.side.the scent.smell fine if you like sweeet smells</li>
    <li> Item arrived today, and I was so excited to smell it!  It smells DELICIOUS!  Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.  Delivery was very fast; I&#x27;m quite pleased, and will be reordering!</li>
    <li> Beautiful lasting perfume. Always received tons of compliments</li>
    <li> Deliciously exotic fragrance.</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with two other Al-Rehab scents (Dalal and Choco Musk); Al-Rashad shipped very, very promptly and I would happily recommend buying from them. Sabaya paled a bit in comparison with the other two for me (to be fair, Dalal has quickly become a favorite scent), but it&#x27;s still very nice, and probably would work wonderfully for someone more inclined to adore fruity florals. That&#x27;s what this is: a true fruity floral; the initial and dominant notes I got were rose and lily of the valley, backed with citrus and a hint of berry. Rose and lily of the valley are very...assertive...florals, and can be overwhelming, and at first, this came close to being a bit too much. Since I like to mention what something reminds me of, I will say it reminds me of D&amp;G&#x27;s Rose the One; according to the note lists I found for both, they do have some in common: rose, lily of the valley, lychee, and cassis -- but Sabaya uses orange rather than grapefruit and clearly has a different set of base notes, and as time passes, it wears much better for me. RTO develops a rancid and unpleasant note for me, and Sabaya doesn&#x27;t. The florals do mellow down, but the notes in it remain pleasant. This is a pretty, bright, cheerful fragrance; these aren&#x27;t the notes I prefer in scents, but it&#x27;s grown on me with wear. It&#x27;s worth mentioning that it layers really well with Choco Musk (I&#x27;m more truly enthusiastic about it with the Choco Musk, personally.) On the right person, this would be gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Worth trying, these oils are really nice.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see both a woman and a man wearing this perfume. While most guys might think - this is too fruity/flowery, not a manly scent at all, I think the women would appreciate it on them. It seems very feminine when in the box, but it actually has this fresh strong note in it (I can&#x27;t quite place it). Its soothing, sweet, but fresh at the same time. My only dislike, is its VERY powerful. It lasts a long time, so be careful. The first time I globbed it on, it was so much, that I had to shower - I was sneezing nonstop. Smelled great doing it, though.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was VERY fast, I received it much sooner than I ever expected. But its very lovely, and strong and exotic.</li>
    <li> This is such a soft slightly sweet scent..like chiffon or a whisper..not loud at all. Love it!!!!</li>
