### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is really a great product!</li>
      <li>This product is so great!!!</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is great...</li>
      <li>I am happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Great travel and gym bag portable make up kit.</li>
      <li>, it looks great on her.</li>
      <li>The shades match my skin perfectly and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The colors are very nice.  </li>
      <li>The pouch for the brushes and travel case are nice and compact and great for travel.</li>
      <li>The make up itself works great and has a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t give me good coverage and didn&#x27;t match my skin.  </li>
      <li>and I find this to be a much better mineral makeup!  </li>
      <li>I got the fair because it said light skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I could find an affordable mineral makeup kit to try before committing a lot of money.</li>
      <li>I was glad this was an &amp;#34;introductory&amp;#34; kit.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
      <li>Overrall, this is absolutely worth the purchase!!</li>
      <li>Nothing is as easy and works so well as mineral makeup.  </li>
      <li>My moisturizer, eye cream, mascara, brow pencil, and eye shadow also fit in the case.</li>
      <li>Not even the &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; was as light as I wanted it to be.</li>
      <li>Feels good on application, not heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>I just received it, used the foundation brush 1 time &amp; it broke, so I super glued it.</li>
      <li>The first time I opened it I got powder everywhere!</li>
      <li>It is a nice makeup kit for the price, and it does even out the tone of my skin without making me seem like my face is a different shade.</li>
      <li>I used Bare Minerals for many years</li>
      <li>sheer cover more money</li>
      <li>better than buying individual products in a retail store.</li>
      <li>I had a small spot of acne, so I used the concealer brush and the fair 1 color to make it invisible.</li>
      <li>Either way, not only do I find this color (fair 2, I think) to be a much better match for me, I find that this makeup stays on much longer, the finishing powder is actually a finishing powder that gives me the finish I like without a powdery or cakey look and the other thing I really enjoy is that wherever I first touch my face with the brush isn&#x27;t obvious all day.  </li>
      <li>Very high quality.</li>
      <li>Handy little kit.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using the BM because of that very reason and was hesitant to try another mineral makeup</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use to much or you will have a very shiny face.</li>
      <li>It was much darker than my skin.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much room to tap it out into the lid.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about it, but I never got any feed back.  </li>
      <li>Therefore I am guessing the product was okay, but not worth bragging about.</li>
      <li>Mainly why I bought her this cheaper stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have this specific kit but a simple review of the makeup itself is important too.  </li>
      <li>i am a 45 year old woman it brought out every wrinkle on my face.</li>
      <li>but I gave it to my 23 year old daughter</li>
      <li>I am just learning to use mineral makeup and so far I like it.</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft and quality.</li>
      <li>The brushes in the kit are really soft and apply the makeup well.</li>
      <li>Its a knock off of bare minerals.</li>
      <li>The kit comes with super small containers of the powder.  </li>
      <li>My complaint and reason for taking a star off is that the mineral veil seems to leave my face feeling kind of tight for whatever reason.</li>
      <li>Should of read reviews but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;This does not color match with the same shade as bare minerals.</li>
      <li>With Bare Minerals there wasn&#x27;t a brush, a swirl, a touch or ANYTHING that left me without some indication of  where I&#x27;d started with the foundation.  </li>
      <li>Finally, this makeup doesn&#x27;t show dryness like Bare Minerals did.  </li>
      <li>spend the extra cash and get bare minerals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you are looking to get the same shade as bare minerals and try to replace makeup with this then no.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>But just turn it upside down and gently tap the powder into the lid.</li>

<li> this stuff is such a mess.</li>
<li> No matter how much I put on my face it never looks thick or cakey!</li>
<li> I also wish the size of the containers were a little bigger</li>
<li> You only need a little bit of the makeup</li>
<li> Not much coverage at all</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> so I expect the small containers to last a while.</li>
<li> I thought it would be like the other mineral powders, where the lid is inset</li>
<li> gave it 2 star rating due to fact</li>
<li> I&#x27;m German and Irish, so my pale skin is hard to find a match for!</li>
<li> Maybe because she doesnt go heavy on it, but other brands seem to hold up so......</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with the other.</li>
<li> Also it does not cover at all and seems to be pointless to wear.</li>
<li> A waste of hard earned money!</li>
<li> The small jars of color are a little annoying.</li>
<li> If you are already using this then it probably isnt bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> just what my daughter asked for as a -  Christmas present - used it immediately</li>
    <li> i am a 45 year old woman it brought out every wrinkle on my face. but I gave it to my 23 year old daughter , it looks great on her.</li>
    <li> I am just learning to use mineral makeup and so far I like it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is such a mess. I thought it would be like the other mineral powders, where the lid is inset so the powder has a place to go but instead it is flush and goes allover when you take the lid off. Also it does not cover at all and seems to be pointless to wear.</li>
    <li> Not much coverage at all</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my complexion. A waste of hard earned money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff but my wife does. Its a knock off of bare minerals. Should of read reviews but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;This does not color match with the same shade as bare minerals. Mainly why I bought her this cheaper stuff. Its does not stay on well either. If you are already using this then it probably isnt bad. If you are looking to get the same shade as bare minerals and try to replace makeup with this then no.&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the extra cash and get bare minerals.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 star rating due to fact it doesn&#x27;t stay on well. Not because it didnt match shades. Using this stuff she has to put it on 2 to 3 times a day. Maybe because she doesnt go heavy on it, but other brands seem to hold up so......</li>
    <li> Handy little kit.  I keep it in my gym bag.  Works as anticipated.  I wish it had included a kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. I was really excited about it, but I never got any feed back.  Therefore I am guessing the product was okay, but not worth bragging about.</li>
    <li> For some reason this product does not agree with my skin, after 2 days of use my skin started getting red bumps.  Stopped using it and the bump&#x27;s went away Have to go back to sheer cover more money but it works</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations! Great travel and gym bag portable make up kit. My moisturizer, eye cream, mascara, brow pencil, and eye shadow also fit in the case. The make up itself works great and has a nice sheen. The brushes are soft and quality.</li>
    <li> I like this make up. A little goes a long way.  Don&#x27;t use to much or you will have a very shiny face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have this specific kit but a simple review of the makeup itself is important too.  I used Bare Minerals for many years and I find this to be a much better mineral makeup!  Could be that my skin has changed with age, I don&#x27;t know.  Either way, not only do I find this color (fair 2, I think) to be a much better match for me, I find that this makeup stays on much longer, the finishing powder is actually a finishing powder that gives me the finish I like without a powdery or cakey look and the other thing I really enjoy is that wherever I first touch my face with the brush isn&#x27;t obvious all day.  With Bare Minerals there wasn&#x27;t a brush, a swirl, a touch or ANYTHING that left me without some indication of  where I&#x27;d started with the foundation.  I have NO problem with that with this makeup.  Finally, this makeup doesn&#x27;t show dryness like Bare Minerals did.  I stopped using the BM because of that very reason and was hesitant to try another mineral makeup but I simply do not have that issue with Mineral Elements.</li>
    <li> It is a nice makeup kit for the price, and it does even out the tone of my skin without making me seem like my face is a different shade. My complaint and reason for taking a star off is that the mineral veil seems to leave my face feeling kind of tight for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> I was glad this was an &amp;#34;introductory&amp;#34; kit.  The kit comes with super small containers of the powder.  It didn&#x27;t give me good coverage and didn&#x27;t match my skin.  I got the fair because it said light skin.  It was much darker than my skin.  Not even the &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; was as light as I wanted it to be.</li>
    <li> Nothing is as easy and works so well as mineral makeup.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 years and use nothing else except a primer before I brush it on. The price on Amazon is great...better than buying individual products in a retail store. The colors are very nice.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this make-up. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.  Feels good on application, not heavy at all.  I&#x27;ve used this makeup for over 3 years.</li>
    <li> Eh...it&#x27;s not bare minerals</li>
    <li> I just received it, used the foundation brush 1 time &amp; it broke, so I super glued it. I also wish the size of the containers were a little bigger</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I could find an affordable mineral makeup kit to try before committing a lot of money. The brushes in the kit are really soft and apply the makeup well. You only need a little bit of the makeup so I expect the small containers to last a while. I only need one shade of the foundation so I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with the other. The pouch for the brushes and travel case are nice and compact and great for travel.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product! I&#x27;m German and Irish, so my pale skin is hard to find a match for! This product is so great!!! No matter how much I put on my face it never looks thick or cakey! The shades match my skin perfectly and it&#x27;s very easy to use. You get 3 brushes. One for foundation, concealer and one for the finishing powder. I had a small spot of acne, so I used the concealer brush and the fair 1 color to make it invisible. The small jars of color are a little annoying. There isn&#x27;t much room to tap it out into the lid. The first time I opened it I got powder everywhere! But just turn it upside down and gently tap the powder into the lid. Overrall, this is absolutely worth the purchase!!</li>
