### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This spray gel works best with heat, either with a diffuser or heated styling tools.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff!!!!</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t, but the best mistake ever!!</li>
      <li>One of the best products ever!!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
      <li>Great price and great product!!!!!</li>
      <li>It works great for scrunching my hair.</li>
      <li>This works great with my kinky curly weave</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>Works good when curling hair</li>
      <li>So glad I made that decision that day!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love this for bouncy crl formation!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found that it works the best with hot rollers versus the curling iron.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s fine for creating a style, but not so great at holding it.  </li>
      <li>Good if it works for you, as some had better luck.</li>
      <li>This product is the absolute best I have found.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both use it and we love it.</li>
      <li>However, what I want is springy curls that have a lot of body and for this, the mousse works better.  </li>
      <li>Order something else if you want a better result than I got.</li>
      <li>This stuff works better on my (and my mother&#x27;s) hair to separate and tighten up the curls.</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>SOOOOO glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love this spray gel.</li>
      <li>All in all, I recommend this gel but not for fine hair and again, I think the Kinkier mousse is better.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I recommend this gel but not for fine hair and again, I think the Kinkier mousse is better.  </li>
      <li>Soft but very nice hold.  </li>
      <li>I actually get better results with the Kinkier Curling Mousse, which is a lot lighter and would be great for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so very much!!!!</li>
      <li>Light on my curls and not sticky.  </li>
      <li>This line is available everywhere.  </li>
      <li>Great for 2nd day hair.</li>
      <li>Pretty quick and efficient!!</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this because I did read good reviews on it, but it definitely didn&#x27;t make my hair shine and</li>
      <li>This gel was worth a try</li>
      <li>The mousse works as well as TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse which is my other favorite.</li>
      <li>Never that crispy hair look with this as you can easily achieve with many other spray gels.</li>
      <li>Needs very little effort to achieve a nice NOT frizzy hair style!</li>
      <li>Funny thing is I accidentally bought these products thinking they were what my hair stylist used.  </li>
      <li>It helps to restore the curl and coil back to the hair, refreshing the look of the hair.</li>
      <li>I liked the consistency because the thinner gel should be easier to apply but in the end, the spray didn&#x27;t spray wide, so I ended up spraying it into the palm of my hand and then applying.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, my local store stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>I use this gel both with hot rollers and with a curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;re fairly priced and likely do exactly the same thing as Schwartzkopf&#x27;s Osis line (Schwartzkopf makes Got2b too).  </li>
      <li>My 12 year old daughter has super curly but frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>However, use it sparingly because too much can leave your hair looking greasy.  </li>
      <li>For thermal protection, Tresemme&#x27;s Sleek Polish spray works really well if you decide not to use a primer.  </li>

      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to spray much and in fact, if you overdo it, you definitely get crunchy stiffness.  </li>
      <li>Typically I can wash - spritz with Got2b Kinkier, let mostly dry - diffuse to get out most of the moisture - and then spritz again any frizz and go..  </li>
      <li>I want to try their new styling spray in the blue bottle, which promises faster drying time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more likely that one is simply priced way above the other albeit with the same ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any ingredient in this gel that actually activates the curls, but it&#x27;s better than other gels I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>As a natural with kinky hair, I&#x27;ve been wearing natural looking protective styles, preferably those that look like my hair, while giving my delicate hair a much needed rest.</li>

    <li> I love this spray gel. Never that crispy hair look with this as you can easily achieve with many other spray gels. Soft but very nice hold.  My daughter and I both use it and we love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this because I did read good reviews on it, but it definitely didn&#x27;t make my hair shine and my curls DROOPED! I liked the consistency because the thinner gel should be easier to apply but in the end, the spray didn&#x27;t spray wide, so I ended up spraying it into the palm of my hand and then applying. It still just didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do though. Good if it works for you, as some had better luck. Everyone&#x27;s hair is really different and will behave differently with different products. This just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, my local store stopped carrying it.  Light on my curls and not sticky.  Yay!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works better on my (and my mother&#x27;s) hair to separate and tighten up the curls.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; spray gel!!  My hair is just curly enough to go crazy, but not straight enough to be straight without major effort.  I&#x27;m all about efficiency in the morning.  Typically I can wash - spritz with Got2b Kinkier, let mostly dry - diffuse to get out most of the moisture - and then spritz again any frizz and go..  Pretty quick and efficient!!</li>
    <li> It works great for scrunching my hair. I have frizzy not really curly hair.</li>

    <li> This spray gel works best with heat, either with a diffuser or heated styling tools.  I use this gel both with hot rollers and with a curling iron.  With the rollers I get genuine curls, loose spirals that hold their shape.  With the curling iron, I get loose waves that are defined.  After curling, I spray my hair generously with either Nexxus Comb Thru or Toni and Guy flexible hairspray, both of which give me touchable, brushable, invisible hold that&#x27;s never sticky or stiff.  Without the hairspray, this gel would never hold the curl.  So it&#x27;s fine for creating a style, but not so great at holding it.  It&#x27;s rather thick so you don&#x27;t have to spray much and in fact, if you overdo it, you definitely get crunchy stiffness.  I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any ingredient in this gel that actually activates the curls, but it&#x27;s better than other gels I&#x27;ve tried.  I actually get better results with the Kinkier Curling Mousse, which is a lot lighter and would be great for fine hair.  My hair&#x27;s medium in texture and slightly wavy and somewhat thick.  However, what I want is springy curls that have a lot of body and for this, the mousse works better.  This gel was worth a try and I&#x27;ve found that it works the best with hot rollers versus the curling iron.  It doesn&#x27;t control frizz on it&#x27;s own but if you use the Got2b Shine Serum on wet hair beforehand, then frizz is kept out of the mix.  I like this line of styling products a lot.  I think they&#x27;re fairly priced and likely do exactly the same thing as Schwartzkopf&#x27;s Osis line (Schwartzkopf makes Got2b too).  After all, why develop two different product lines?  It&#x27;s more likely that one is simply priced way above the other albeit with the same ingredients.  I think I paid $4 or $5 for this gel in the drugstore, so don&#x27;t be swayed by the sellers on Amazon.  This line is available everywhere.  I want to try their new styling spray in the blue bottle, which promises faster drying time.  I noticed it the other day in the grocery store where it was about $4.50.  I do use a styling primer, which I think makes a big difference in how well the styling products I use work.  The primer, Smooth Criminal (at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply) fights frizz, provides thermal protection and gives me mega watt shine.  I use it on damp, towel dry hair and then use either the Got2be mousse or the spray gel and then let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning I use the heated tools.  This cuts down on damage and keeps my hair healthy.  For thermal protection, Tresemme&#x27;s Sleek Polish spray works really well if you decide not to use a primer.  However, use it sparingly because too much can leave your hair looking greasy.  I learned that the hard way.  If you use just a little it leaves a fantastic shiny mass of curls.  It would work well for flatironing too.  It would probably weigh down fine hair though.  All in all, I recommend this gel but not for fine hair and again, I think the Kinkier mousse is better.

    <li> I love the way it makes my only slightly wavy hair perk up.  I haven&#x27;t used a curling iron on my short hair since I discovered this product about 3 years ago.</li>
    <li> I bumped into this at the local discount store and decided to try it...What????? A product made for &#x27;kinky&#x27; hair???? I just HAD to try it!!!! SOOOOO glad I did. As a natural with kinky hair, I&#x27;ve been wearing natural looking protective styles, preferably those that look like my hair, while giving my delicate hair a much needed rest. This works great with my kinky curly weave and I SWEAR by it!!! It helps to restore the curl and coil back to the hair, refreshing the look of the hair. I recommend this to everyone I see wearing curly braids or weaves. I LOVE IT!!!! So glad I made that decision that day!</li>
    <li> Sticky and doesn&#x27;t hold the set. Need I say more? Order something else if you want a better result than I got.</li>
    <li> Love this for bouncy crl formation!  Good stuff</li>
    <li> Works good when curling hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for 2nd day hair.</li>
