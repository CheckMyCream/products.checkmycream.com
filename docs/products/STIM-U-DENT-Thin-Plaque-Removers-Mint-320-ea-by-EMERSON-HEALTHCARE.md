      <li>Great product but the box was messed up.  </li>
      <li>great product when you don&#x27;t have time to floss.  </li>
      <li>Great product, helps me get good dental visits.</li>
      <li>Good price and delivery</li>
      <li>One of the best way to keep teeth free of debris between meals and until you can brush and floss.</li>
      <li>The flavor is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Much better that the thicker ones although sometimes they break easier.</li>
      <li>Much better than a toothpick</li>
      <li>I have used Stim-u-dents for MANY years.</li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>Fits better between close teeth.</li>
      <li>These new thinner ones are even better.</li>
      <li>The small size fits beautifully into a gap between my molars that catches food at every meal.</li>
      <li>Then a new product came out that did a great job getting into tight spots, but easily bent.  </li>
      <li>Glad they finally came out with one that is thinner than the original.</li>
      <li>Another great thing is that, although they are pointed, the point is not a &amp;#34;needle point&amp;#34; and not sharp enough to puncture the gums or sensitive areas at the gum margin.</li>
      <li>This slim pick is flimsy compared to the thicker &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; pack, but will fit between tightly spaced teeth better.</li>
      <li>Luckily, the product inside the box is enclosed into individual packages and they seemed to be clean.</li>
      <li>The soft yet rigid material gently permits me to clean my teeth without needing to floss all of the time.</li>
      <li>I find these thin sticks much better for getting between teeth compared to the original ones.</li>
      <li>There is only one negative and that is their tendency to break more easily.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with them and highly recommend them, particularly if you have some big spaces and some small spaces where food gets packed in like I do.</li>
      <li>been using the thick ones for years but these thin ones a way more effective for me.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re thin enough to fit between my teeth and keep them clean.</li>
      <li>These are also soft enough to flex rather than poke your gums.</li>
      <li>Soft enough not to irritate gums.</li>
      <li>Love the thin stimudents</li>
      <li>These thin toothpicks are better than the thicker ones....</li>

    <li> Good price and delivery and they work well.</li>
    <li> Great product, helps me get good dental visits.</li>
    <li> I love these things. The small size fits beautifully into a gap between my molars that catches food at every meal. The soft yet rigid material gently permits me to clean my teeth without needing to floss all of the time.</li>
    <li> been using the thick ones for years but these thin ones a way more effective for me.</li>
    <li> It keeps breaking.  Needs to be made of stronger wood, I think.  I prefer the tea tree oil + cinnamon tooth pics!</li>
    <li> I have used Stim-u-dents for MANY years. These new thinner ones are even better. There is only one negative and that is their tendency to break more easily.</li>
    <li> Have used for years. Glad they finally came out with one that is thinner than the original. Work great! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular Stimudents for a lot of years.  Then a new product came out that did a great job getting into tight spots, but easily bent.  I continued to use both products.  When these thin ones came out, I was really skeptical.  Early on, I broke quite a few of them, but a pack still lasted longer than the regular ones.  Then I figured out how to use them.  Now I use these thin ones almost exclusively.  I am very satisfied with them and highly recommend them, particularly if you have some big spaces and some small spaces where food gets packed in like I do.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re thin enough to fit between my teeth and keep them clean. Soft enough not to irritate gums. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> great product when you don&#x27;t have time to floss.  Can carry anywhere.  This slim pick is flimsy compared to the thicker &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; pack, but will fit between tightly spaced teeth better.</li>
    <li> Great product but the box was messed up.  It looked like whoever packed it into the  mailing envelope had been eating ice cream or something as it was smeared on the box.  Luckily, the product inside the box is enclosed into individual packages and they seemed to be clean.</li>
    <li> Love the thin stimudents</li>
    <li> Much better that the thicker ones although sometimes they break easier. Fits better between close teeth. Does a great job of massaging gums.</li>

    <li> Ideal for taking care of your teeth!</li>
    <li> These are thin enough to go between my rather tightly-spaced teeth without breaking immediately. They insert all the way through the gap which gets food out, back and front. Another great thing is that, although they are pointed, the point is not a &amp;#34;needle point&amp;#34; and not sharp enough to puncture the gums or sensitive areas at the gum margin. These are also soft enough to flex rather than poke your gums. The flavor is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I could not find these in our city ( the thin ones). The ones I ordered from you should have been the &amp;#34;mint flavored&amp;#34; ones and I did not get the mint ones</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t make these any longer, bought what I could to get into the small crevices in between&lt;br /&gt;my teeth..</li>
    <li> Much better than a toothpick</li>
