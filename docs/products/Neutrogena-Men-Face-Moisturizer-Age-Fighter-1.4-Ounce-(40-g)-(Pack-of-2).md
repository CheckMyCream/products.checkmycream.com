### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great as a moisturizer and sunblock!</li>
      <li>The Best men&#x27;s face cream on the market.  </li>
      <li>but this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s perfect to use as my single-step face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Its the best product I&#x27;ve found</li>
      <li>fly a lot.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years, and it&#x27;s very effective for preventing dryness.</li>
      <li>is very nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now, and I think it is excellent in keeping the skin in good shape without too many wrinkles.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
      <li>Some I bought has good aroma.</li>
      <li>I feel good using it.</li>
      <li>Everyone gave it good reviews and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t find anything as good yet either.</li>
      <li>This, amazingly, doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>This product has worked amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>and (it may be my own wishful thinking)</li>
      <li>Really works great!</li>
      <li>The closest match to the ingredients of the original great product is this L&#x27;Oreal product:</li>
      <li>good product, I&#x27;m been using it for over a year and seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an alternative to Olay Complete (which tended to pill-up and/or come off my face during the day); this was and still is an excellent replacement.</li>
      <li>The old formula (non-broad spectrum) was the best face lotion I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>and I have very light complextion</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say that it makes me look any younger, but it is a wonderful, greaseless, very light moisterizer that I use on my face and the backs of my hands.  </li>
      <li>i love the item</li>
      <li>I also get way more comments like &amp;</li>
      <li>This has turned out to be one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>So many moisturizing creams leave my face looking shiny and oily.  </li>
      <li>I guess a bit more sleep would help too.</li>
      <li>Ordered more from amazon</li>
      <li>Overall, an excellent product!</li>
      <li>Price for 2 was better than the price for 1 at all the stores in my area,so who can lose?</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many of these types of products.  </li>
      <li>Works great, and goes on completely into the skin ... nothing to feel on your skin but smoothness.</li>
      <li>I love it because it goes on light and does not leave my skin oily or shiny.  </li>
      <li>Been using this product too many years to count and for good reason; it&#x27;s light and has retinol and a decent amount of SPF.</li>
      <li>But it leaves my skin moist and smooth.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smooth, rich cream - not a gloppy lotion - and it makes your skin feel smooth and comfortable without oiliness or any scent.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product.</li>
      <li>Probably good for younger men, too.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face nicely moisturized and young looking.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find any of the older lotion</li>
      <li>The lotion itself goes on clean and rubs right in.  </li>
      <li>(this one is &#x27;broad spectrum SPF 15 on the tube vs. just SPF 15) but it is much heavier, leaves my face a bit shiny, and has started to smell more and more like burnt plastic.  </li>
      <li>Be aware!</li>
      <li>Light weight, quick absorbing, kept my face looking fresh and not shiny.  </li>
      <li>It works as advertised and really DID get rid of the fine lines on my face.</li>
      <li>But for now, this seems worth the price</li>
      <li>It really does make your face look more vibrant.</li>
      <li>This product is actually pretty good at keeping my face mosturized, yet not too oily like some other products.  </li>
      <li>I had previously purchased this from a drug store and loved it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, and I get IDed more than I did last year (I&#x27;m 28).</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been more concerned with the overall condition of my skin and this product delivers.</li>
      <li>This stuff seems to work as well as higher priced ones.  </li>
      <li>The price is a lot better on Amazon vs. the local pharmacy.</li>
      <li>I also bought a face cleanser which I use first in the morning, then apply this lotion.  </li>
      <li>: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good men&#x27;s moisturizer</li>
      <li>Not much we can do any more.  </li>
      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;</li>
      <li>Result: fewer lines and skin that isn&#x27;t aging as fast as the rest of me.</li>
      <li>This product is a waist of money, really go elsewhere</li>
      <li>I love this product, good little tube, last me very long time and of course, user is the one that dictate the content.</li>
      <li>I found that Kiehls 1851 has much more to offer for men, they have several products with higher capacity (75ml, 200ml), and they actually have tons of moist.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It absorbs better and feels a bit less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the wrinkle aspect, as I am fairly young and haven&#x27;t paid much attention.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to men over 50.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have moderately sensitive skin and have tried many other products on the market.  </li>
      <li>is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new)</li>
      <li>This is the first facial application I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t feel like a moisture cream when it goes on and that dramatically reduces my oily complexion throughout the day.</li>
      <li>but i like it so far!</li>
      <li>My girlfriend uses it even though it clearly states on the packaging that it is for men, and I have seen no distressing changes in her appearance or the pitch of her voice.</li>
      <li>really that low for that price?&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It keep my goat alive</li>
      <li>As far a wrinkle reduction,</li>
      <li>Also my fiance started using it; he appreciates how it goes on light and not greasy or heavy at all.</li>
      <li>I must agree with one of the reviewers that it does not make your face greasy at the end of the day which is different to the other lotion i use by neutrogena and that is a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>However, based on my limited experience, I am very please with this product.  </li>
      <li>Not sure why Neutrogena messed with the original Age Fighter lotion, but I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.  </li>
      <li>It does work only if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion.</li>
      <li>However, the pricing was a little too much for me for only 1.4 ounce</li>

<li> I shave with an electric razor but even during the winter months my skin gets dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d prefer it came in a plastic tube instead of the current aluminum, but I&#x27;ve not had any trouble with TSA (I don&#x27;t put it in the zip-lock).&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
<li> When my face is dry, it is less so after using this product.</li>
<li> Leave it to the folks at Neutrogena to come up with a SPF15 with an age-fighting complex that actually works!</li>
<li> #34;you have a baby face&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m going to nicer bars now with less college crowd.</li>
<li> Some just plain.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure this moisturizer is actually engaged in a fight with aging -- and if it is it seems to be engaged in a losing battle -- but nonetheless, this is a quality (if expensive) product from a trusted brand.</li>
<li> It does hide small wrinkles and gives the face a smoother look.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to say, I never saw myself using face moisturizing cream. But after using this product I can&#x27;t see myself turning back. All it takes is a small dab and you feel like an angel kissed your face. I can&#x27;t say much about the wrinkle aspect, as I am fairly young and haven&#x27;t paid much attention. Overall, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> It does work only if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me. Everyone gave it good reviews and that&#x27;s why I bought it. But I get pimples on my chin now. So I had to stop using it. That and it makes my face look so pale, yuck!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and feels it provides enough protection form being in the sun</li>
    <li> Be aware! Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product. Instead of 2 sunscreens it now has 4 different ones and the box now says &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;. The downside is the product now:&lt;br /&gt;- Stings the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion. The closest match to the ingredients of the original great product is this L&#x27;Oreal product: http://amzn.to/1AOwyCH&lt;br /&gt;Here is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame.</li>
    <li> This product is actually pretty good at keeping my face mosturized, yet not too oily like some other products.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Leave it to the folks at Neutrogena to come up with a SPF15 with an age-fighting complex that actually works! I use the Olay Serum before I apply this daily, and I am now protected (somewhat) from the harmful rays of the sun. I was looking for an alternative to Olay Complete (which tended to pill-up and/or come off my face during the day); this was and still is an excellent replacement. Works great, and goes on completely into the skin ... nothing to feel on your skin but smoothness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what was in the picture &amp; how was described . i love the item is very nice thank you so much</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work as well as higher priced ones.  I don&#x27;t know if it fights age.  But it leaves my skin moist and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have moderately sensitive skin and have tried many other products on the market.  This product has worked amazingly well.  I use it daily and will re-apply when out in the sun for longer periods of time.  Really works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year or so now.  I love it because it goes on light and does not leave my skin oily or shiny.  The 15 spf is critical for me as I have plenty of sun damage from years of abuse and I have very light complextion</li>
    <li> Also my fiance started using it; he appreciates how it goes on light and not greasy or heavy at all.</li>
    <li> Does not provide skin cancer protection, only protection from sunburn.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Sun protection and moisturisers, no fragrance.  I use it every day.  Result: fewer lines and skin that isn&#x27;t aging as fast as the rest of me. I highly recommend this to men over 50. Probably good for younger men, too.</li>
    <li> We aging Age Fighters need all the help we can get.  I&#x27;ve reordered five times, so I guess it must work.  Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Just kidding. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena for years and trust the brand, so I haven&#x27;t felt the need to switch. I upgraded from Triple Protect, and I like the feel of this product. It absorbs better and feels a bit less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, and I get IDed more than I did last year (I&#x27;m 28). I also get way more comments like &amp;#34;you have a baby face&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m going to nicer bars now with less college crowd.</li>
    <li> not enough time to know if its gonna stop aging im only 24, but i like it so far!</li>
    <li> I shave with an electric razor but even during the winter months my skin gets dry. I use this product after I shave it takes the redness out of my skin and moisturizes my skin all day. Its the best product I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried Bath &amp; Body Works to no avail.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many of these types of products.  However, based on my limited experience, I am very please with this product.  I also bought a face cleanser which I use first in the morning, then apply this lotion.  After a couple minutes, I can feel my face tighten up and (it may be my own wishful thinking) look younger.  The lotion itself goes on clean and rubs right in.  This will probably be a repeat buy for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this moisturizer is actually engaged in a fight with aging -- and if it is it seems to be engaged in a losing battle -- but nonetheless, this is a quality (if expensive) product from a trusted brand. When my face is dry, it is less so after using this product. What little fragrance it has is subtle and inoffensive. My girlfriend uses it even though it clearly states on the packaging that it is for men, and I have seen no distressing changes in her appearance or the pitch of her voice.</li>
    <li> I must agree with one of the reviewers that it does not make your face greasy at the end of the day which is different to the other lotion i use by neutrogena and that is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> * 40 gr? really that low for that price?&lt;br /&gt;* It does not moisturize. Simply. I found that Kiehls 1851 has much more to offer for men, they have several products with higher capacity (75ml, 200ml), and they actually have tons of moist.&lt;br /&gt;* This product is a waist of money, really go elsewhere</li>
    <li> I love this product, good little tube, last me very long time and of course, user is the one that dictate the content. I feel good using it. It keep my goat alive</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this from a drug store and loved it.  Light weight, quick absorbing, kept my face looking fresh and not shiny.  Ordered more from amazon and I don&#x27;t know if Neutrogena changed the formula or if this is a different product (this one is &#x27;broad spectrum SPF 15 on the tube vs. just SPF 15) but it is much heavier, leaves my face a bit shiny, and has started to smell more and more like burnt plastic.  Looking for another face moisturizer now.</li>
    <li> Beware, I ordered the one without the sunscreen, but what I got was the one with sunscreen.  Return on the way.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Not greasy, absorbs into the skin and moisturizes.  Just what a guy needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now, and I think it is excellent in keeping the skin in good shape without too many wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have a relatively oily face and until now, I&#x27;ve either dried my face out with all kinds of facial cleansers or over-moisterized it with various facial moisterizers.  This is the first facial application I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t feel like a moisture cream when it goes on and that dramatically reduces my oily complexion throughout the day. As far a wrinkle reduction, maybe so but I&#x27;ve been more concerned with the overall condition of my skin and this product delivers.</li>
    <li> So many moisturizing creams leave my face looking shiny and oily.  This, amazingly, doesn&#x27;t.  It also has SPF so it&#x27;s perfect to use as my single-step face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that it makes me look any younger, but it is a wonderful, greaseless, very light moisterizer that I use on my face and the backs of my hands.  I am a 66 year-old man.  Not much we can do any more.  Ha Ha.</li>
    <li> After bouncing around from cream to cream I always come back to nutragena&#x27;s Age fighter. Been using this product too many years to count and for good reason; it&#x27;s light and has retinol and a decent amount of SPF.</li>
    <li> This is not the same thing that Neutrogena sells.  This is an overpriced sun screen and not the Age Fighter product. In comparing the active ingredient list and the package this talks of sun protection and little less.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this and find the real product elsewhere</li>
    <li> Works great as a moisturizer and sunblock!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good men&#x27;s moisturizer but this is the best I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s a smooth, rich cream - not a gloppy lotion - and it makes your skin feel smooth and comfortable without oiliness or any scent. Too bad it&#x27;s so hard to find any more in stores as Neutrogena keeps phasing out and introducing new products so fast.</li>
    <li> The Best men&#x27;s face cream on the market.  It does hide small wrinkles and gives the face a smoother look.  The lotion is not greasy and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Price for 2 was better than the price for 1 at all the stores in my area,so who can lose?</li>
    <li> Some I bought has good aroma. Some just plain. Don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> I usually use Clarins for men but it&#x27;s a little expensive and doesn&#x27;t have SPF coverage so I thought I&#x27;d try this. Overall it seems to work well and it&#x27;s helped my skin look as if I&#x27;m 18 again...actually it hasn&#x27;t but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> Product lives up to its expectations. I have been using it for years and will continue to use it for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> The old formula (non-broad spectrum) was the best face lotion I have ever used.  This new formulation is terrible.  It leaves my face oily, greasy, and with a sheen until I wipe my face with a towel of some sort.  It also now has an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; medicine-y smell to it that is noticeable when applied.  Not sure why Neutrogena messed with the original Age Fighter lotion, but I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find any of the older lotion and I can&#x27;t find anything as good yet either.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year. It keeps my face nicely moisturized and young looking. It really does make your face look more vibrant. However, the pricing was a little too much for me for only 1.4 ounce so I decided to just use the face lotion version.</li>
    <li> Lotion works well and does not leave my face feeling greasy!  Like that it has SPF in it for days when I&#x27;m outside.  Fragrance free as well.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I was skeptical. It works as advertised and really DID get rid of the fine lines on my face. Before and after pics were more dramatic than I expected! Seriously! I am a 53yo male. Worked for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, and it&#x27;s very effective for preventing dryness. I especially like the fact that it has no fragrance. The price is a lot better on Amazon vs. the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be one of my favorite moisturizers.  You can feel the difference almost immediately, but if you think this will remove all the damage we men do to our faces, it won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I fly a lot.  I&#x27;d prefer it came in a plastic tube instead of the current aluminum, but I&#x27;ve not had any trouble with TSA (I don&#x27;t put it in the zip-lock).&lt;br /&gt;Long term... who knows, maybe it will be a miracle worker.  But for now, this seems worth the price (I consider this to be expensive).  I guess a bit more sleep would help too.</li>
    <li> good product, I&#x27;m been using it for over a year and seems to work fine.</li>
