      <li>Udderly Smooth with</li>
      <li>so smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Another thing I like about Udderly Smooth is the packaging.  </li>
      <li>I read that Udderly Smooth with Urea helps get rid of vericocity.  </li>
      <li>The urea makes my skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>I must say I have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the years and this is by far the best for my problem.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented and absorbs fairly quick.</li>
      <li>Great for extremely dry skin on my feet.</li>
      <li>Great for rough feet.  </li>
      <li>I love that you dont need much to use when lathering.</li>
      <li>was  only1/2 full of the cream.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so gentle and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The container was only 2/3 full at most with top to bottom void -- lacking quality control in filling container or just don&#x27;t fill it up.  </li>
      <li>Mine feel pretty smooth all over since using this.</li>
      <li>and it seems, after not too much time that Udderly is helping smooth that out.</li>
      <li>I had never heard of this and found the Udderly Smooth brand cream with 20% Urea and decided to try it because the price was good and I wouldn&#x27;t feel I had wasted my money in case</li>
      <li>Underlying Smooth Extra works much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Much more liquid vs the regular udderly smooth product.  </li>
      <li>If you have spider veins anywhere and want to get rid of them, this cr&amp;egrave;me is worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of Udderly Smooth Udder cream and have used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>This is going right into the trash.</li>
      <li>Very good for dry skin treatment specially for dry craked heal.  </li>
      <li>Very good for really dry skin areas such as bottom of heels.</li>
      <li>20% Urea has worked very, very well for me.  </li>
      <li>Cream seems ok if actually 20% urea.  </li>
      <li>Is this the authentic cream from the same vendor the others got it from?  </li>
      <li>So many products come in tubes, and when you have used a lot of the product you then have to cut the tube open to get out the rest.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I used a product with 20% Urea.</li>
      <li>shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>My chest, neck &amp; back don&#x27;t mind as it&#x27;s better than being covered in bumps.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so sticky that I haven&#x27;t been able to make myself use it a second time.</li>
      <li>This is as good as that that first more expensive product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have anything technical to say about the ingredients or anything like that - I&#x27;m just happy that they aren&#x27;t full of preservatives and artificial things, and they have no fragrance, which is nice.</li>
      <li>This plastic jar is so easy to use, and you can see exactly how much you have left.</li>
      <li>dries quickly and makes your skin soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a woman of a &#x27;certain age&#x27; and my legs</li>
      <li>Really good stuff, especially for very dry and problematic skin.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d love to have a pump bottle version rather than twist off top, which is sometimes tough to close with moisturized hands.  </li>
      <li>really works</li>
      <li>Smooth Extra Care comes close to fixing my splitting problem and is greaseless after I rub it in.</li>
      <li>Specifications met all my requirements: My internal medicine doctor recommended urea ingredient and Udderly Smooth brand for my itchy skin.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It really works.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipment</li>
      <li>but this is a whole lot cheaper</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and helps with my condition.</li>
      <li>It has been a while since I have used Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream.</li>
      <li>Worked very well to sooth a rash that was a side effect of chemotherapy.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the box the plastic wrap around the  jar of &amp;#34;Udderly Smooth Extra care Cream&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Works great on dry, dark elbows!  </li>
      <li>Several months later I&#x27;m more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing but not heavy.</li>
      <li>It is, alas, a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Since I am having some severe dry skin problems on a couple of fingers my wife thought that the  extra care cream might be a better  product to try.  </li>
      <li>Why do so many people say it&#x27;s such a smooth and silky, moisturizing cream while a few of us have a different experience?</li>
      <li>The instructor in my classes said to use it only on the heels and arches of the feet, but after doing that for a while, I have decided to go ahead and use it on the top of my feet and also on my lower legs which are very dry.  </li>
      <li>We now have a new paper weight to use until we throw it out.</li>
      <li>It made her hands very soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought my first jar of cream with 20% urea at my podiatrist and use it on my feet only. This is as good as that that first more expensive product. My heels are not calloused anymore. I don&#x27;t know how these products differ by brand.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I didn&#x27;t try the other 2 brands on my legs. I&#x27;m a woman of a &#x27;certain age&#x27; and my legs had that tissue look/feel and it seems, after not too much time that Udderly is helping smooth that out.</li>
    <li> I bought this to fix some keratosis pilaris. I read that urea was the secret remedy. It&#x27;s not so secret now. This did WONDERS for my skin!!! I have to wash it off my hands after application as it feels tacky. My chest, neck &amp; back don&#x27;t mind as it&#x27;s better than being covered in bumps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this creme since October on the spider veins on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;I had read that an unknown side effect of the cr&amp;egrave;me was disappearing spider veins.  I thought well I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;It really works.  If you have spider veins anywhere and want to get rid of them, this cr&amp;egrave;me is worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I have one small spider vein beside my nose and I am now trying it on that.&lt;br /&gt;The cr&amp;egrave;me is very smooth and goes in well.  It works well on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are two types of this cr&amp;egrave;me and you must get the one with 20% urea if using for spider veins.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for the cream with 20% Urea and hopefully after enough time and use, I will see the results I expect.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Udderly Smooth Udder cream and have used it for many years.  Since I am having some severe dry skin problems on a couple of fingers my wife thought that the  extra care cream might be a better  product to try.  What a disappointment, the cream was thinner than expected and leaves the skin  feeling rather stickey.  I ended up washing it off and going back to the Udder cream.  My wife tried it also with  the same results.  We now have a new paper weight to use until we throw it out.</li>
    <li> Has done a good job on my hands !!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so sticky that I haven&#x27;t been able to make myself use it a second time.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor, works great.</li>
    <li> Great for extremely dry skin on my feet. Seems to take care of the all the dry spots on my feet. I have used a 3 oz $12.50 tube of another brand compare to 8 oz $14.50 jar of this and I see no difference between them they both do the job but this is a whole lot cheaper</li>
    <li> Incredibly moisturizing. I don&#x27;t have anything technical to say about the ingredients or anything like that - I&#x27;m just happy that they aren&#x27;t full of preservatives and artificial things, and they have no fragrance, which is nice. You can put it on anywhere and it&#x27;s so gentle and refreshing. Great for sensitive skin, anywhere on your body and face.</li>
    <li> Great for rough feet.  Mine feel pretty smooth all over since using this.</li>
    <li> The lotion feels nice, but I was looking for something that is paraben free.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well for dry skin in the winter and was delivered on time</li>
    <li> The doctor recommended urea cream for my rough, calloused feet. After a week the improvement was impressive. Several months later I&#x27;m more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the years and this is by far the best for my problem.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Does coat fingernail polish, though.  Has to be wiped off.</li>
    <li> Cream seems ok if actually 20% urea.  The container was only 2/3 full at most with top to bottom void -- lacking quality control in filling container or just don&#x27;t fill it up.  Don&#x27;t know if 8 oz but probably about 5oz.</li>
    <li> I have had swollen ankles for several years and gradually the skin around them became very dry, hardened and thick.  My dermatologist recommended a cream with 20% urea.  Udderly Smooth with 20% Urea has worked very, very well for me.  I apply it twice a day; once after my morning shower and once in the evening.  I have read (and my doctor told me)  that urea can soften the fingernails so I am careful not to get any on my nails.  I use a spatula to apply it to my ankles and wash my hands afterwards.  In just a couple of weeks my ankles have improved immensely.  Another thing I like about Udderly Smooth is the packaging.  So many products come in tubes, and when you have used a lot of the product you then have to cut the tube open to get out the rest.  This plastic jar is so easy to use, and you can see exactly how much you have left. Needless to say, I will be purchasing another jar soon.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had a split on the tip of my thumb that just wouldn&#x27;t heal. I&#x27;ve been putting this cream on it for 1 day (!) and it is almost gone and no longer stings! :) very happy!</li>
    <li> It is ok but not great/</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T EVEN FIND ONE STAR FOR THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS THE WORST CREAM I HAVE EVER USED AND I HAVE TRIED A GAZILLION.  IT WAS VERY THIN COMPARED TO THE &amp;#34;UREA CARE&amp;#34; PRACTITIONER STRENGTH THAT I ALSO ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON.  NOT ONLY THAT,  BUT AFTER IT DRIED ON YOUR HANDS IT TURNED A CHAUKY WHITE COLOR THAT WAS DISGUSTING TO LOOK AT.  EITHER I GOT A BAD BATCH OR LIKE THE OTHER FELLOW SAID,  IT IS JUST BAD.  I WOULD SEND IT BACK FOR ANOTHER TUBE OF UREA CARE, 100% UREA,  BUT IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Well priced, works with my other more expensive products and  better than some of the expensive ones.  Have been using for several years.  Helps prevent cracked finger tips in the winter.</li>
    <li> Works great on dry, dark elbows!  My dermatologist said to use Stratus Pharmaceuticals 20% Urea cream, got this as well, think it works just as well! Like the tub as opposed to a tube!</li>
    <li> I am confused, just got this cream, thought it was going to be silky smooth and moisturizing like so many of the reviews; however, like a few people stated, it makes my skin feel chaulky and weird.  Is this the authentic cream from the same vendor the others got it from?  Why do so many people say it&#x27;s such a smooth and silky, moisturizing cream while a few of us have a different experience?</li>
    <li> Will Order more. It works great!</li>
    <li> My wife needs it for her chmo pills and I will keep a little on hand</li>
    <li> Works great for cracked heals and hands.  Foot Dr recommended for the heal pain and cracks.  Fast shipment</li>
    <li> Good stuff. really works</li>
    <li> Great price on 20% urea cream.  It&#x27;s lightly scented and absorbs fairly quick.</li>
    <li> I attended a set of classes on diabetes and one of the suggestions was to get a cream with UREA.  I had never heard of this and found the Udderly Smooth brand cream with 20% Urea and decided to try it because the price was good and I wouldn&#x27;t feel I had wasted my money in case it didn&#x27;t work.  I must say I have been very pleased with the results so far.  I have not used it that long and it&#x27;s hard for me to remember to use it daily, but I have noticed a difference in my feet already.  The instructor in my classes said to use it only on the heels and arches of the feet, but after doing that for a while, I have decided to go ahead and use it on the top of my feet and also on my lower legs which are very dry.  I can already tell a difference in the smoothness of my skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as dry.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I read that Udderly Smooth with Urea helps get rid of vericocity.  It made my skin soft but didn&#x27;t do anything for my small spider veins.</li>
    <li> Extra care Skin  cream:  Very good for dry skin treatment specially for dry craked heal.  This cream has 20% urea which heals the dry cracked skin and makes it softer.</li>
    <li> I use this every day after my shower, and it keeps the moisture in my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well and helps with dry skin.  No way to say it is better than some over the counter less expensive creams but it is effective.</li>
    <li> super awesome cream!! shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> Seems to make my feet softer, has a creamy texture I like better than the ointments. Soaks in well.</li>
    <li> Udderly fine with me.  Much more liquid vs the regular udderly smooth product.  No complaints.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good for really dry skin areas such as bottom of heels. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Working well on the sore feet. It was good to receive this item so quickly so I could get relief.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box the plastic wrap around the  jar of &amp;#34;Udderly Smooth Extra care Cream&amp;#34; was  only1/2 full of the cream. The lid was  not screwed on tight enough.&lt;br /&gt;However, what I got of the Cream is very good.</li>
    <li> great cream and feels so good on my face. dries quickly and makes your skin soft. very happy with this regardless of the funny name!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and helps with my condition.</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely awful. I don&#x27;t know if it is even the real cream because there was no seal other than the lid. It leaves the most uncomfortable sticky, chalky residue on your skin. I paid a lot of money for a very poor product and I&#x27;m udderly disappointed.</li>
    <li> so smooth and creamy. I love that you dont need much to use when lathering.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream hoping it would reduce the appearance of my spider veins and it is early days, but I do see a slight improvement in the veins by my ankle.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Feels great soaks in quickly and NOT greasy!</li>
    <li> works as promised, love the texture.</li>
    <li> Saw many recommendations for this cream and am so glad I bought it.  Nothing soothes my sun and medication damaged hands like this stuff does.  It is rather liquid and I&#x27;d love to have a pump bottle version rather than twist off top, which is sometimes tough to close with moisturized hands.  I will also buy a smaller purse size.</li>
    <li> Specifications met all my requirements: My internal medicine doctor recommended urea ingredient and Udderly Smooth brand for my itchy skin. Ingredient list included dimethicone ingredient, which is used for itchy skin. Goes on skin smooth, but dries sort of dry/chalky, a disappointment for me.</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I have used Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream. I am so glad that I purchased it again. It has really helped my dry skin. I already recommended it to 2 of my friends. None of my regular skin creams were helping me until I bought this product. I am so pleased.</li>
    <li> Love it for soothing thirsty skin without feeling greasy. Product and delivery both as advertised.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this.  If I use it several times in a row it does seem to fade spider veins, however, it appears to me that they just come back if you discontinue use.  It seems you never arrive at the point where you don&#x27;t have to use this.</li>
    <li> Had hoped it would help minimize some of my spider veins as I had read from previous testimonies of users, but to no avail.  It is, alas, a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with this product.  Basically, I use it just on my feet and heels and it has softened&lt;br /&gt;by skin quite nicely.  I believe having the 20% Urea as an ingredient explains this.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff, especially for very dry and problematic skin.  I&#x27;ve used it daily and it works better than my prescription ointment for psoriasis did.</li>
    <li> I have used some of their products before with good results. This is the first time I used a product with 20% Urea.My hands were constantly peeling and this has slowed that down a lot.</li>
    <li> Not convinced it actually contains 20% urea. But a nice cream. Have only used it for a couple of weeks, so who knows?  It may make my skin young again (-:</li>
    <li> I find this a bit too thick to use on my body, but for my hands and especially my feet, it&#x27;s unbeatable. Smooths roughness and callouses and keeps the moisture in so that I literally never get dry, rough hands anymore.  I bought it because of the high concentration of urea - 20% is hard to find, and it really does work. Other urea products can be VERY expensive - this works just as well and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. For the price, there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
    <li> Bought this because the vast majority of the reviews were positive.  However, I agree with those who found the cream to be thin and left a sticky residue on the skin.  I couldn&#x27;t stand how yucky it made my hands feel and had to wash it off immediately.  This is going right into the trash.</li>
    <li> The older I get, the less oil my skin produces and that causes the skin on the work side of my hands causes  to dry out and split at the pressure points including the area around my finger nails.  It&#x27;s painful which reduces what I can do with my hands.  Wearing gloves, Band Aids, the smelly skin seal stuff helps somewhat but burns and increases the splitting problem.  I have been automatically buying anything claiming to stop this problem and none of it works very good  except petroleum jelly and it&#x27;s too greasy to use except over night.  Udderly Smooth Extra Care comes close to fixing my splitting problem and is greaseless after I rub it in. The urea makes my skin smooth.  Underlying Smooth Extra works much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  Each application lasts an acceptable amount of time unless my hands get wet.  It really works good and beats the stuff my doctor prescribes.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked very well to sooth a rash that was a side effect of chemotherapy.  Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing but not heavy.</li>
    <li> This was suggested for my mother when she was having chemo for her skin. It made her hands very soft. So I tried it. This is the  only product that has worked clearing up dry, cracked skin on my feet.</li>
