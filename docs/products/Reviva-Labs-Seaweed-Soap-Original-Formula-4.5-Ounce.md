      <li>I love the way this soap makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found it again</li>
      <li>and I just love it</li>
      <li>I love seaweed soap</li>
      <li>Very scrubby with seaweed particles, I find it great for cellulite, leaves skin noticeably tighter and smoother.  </li>
      <li>The first bar I got was from a friend I searched all over for this soap found some soaps that said seaweed soap but in no way where they!!!</li>
      <li>This goes on/off easy and nice light smell.</li>
      <li>It seems to have done a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>First of all, this soap works really good.</li>
      <li>the scrubbing action is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Luckily, it was available on Amazon, and I&#x27;d rather buy in quantities anyways, so this fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has light scrubbing power, which is not what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>Smells clean and fresh, and the scrubbing action is great for my complexion.  </li>
      <li>The only stuff I&#x27;ve used for many many years!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this to see if it would improve the texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>; clean.  </li>
      <li>It makes you feel clean without drying your skin.  </li>
      <li>(I go through one per month), though I may have to leave that up to others to decide if that is a good durable time since before using these bars I only ever used liquid body wash.</li>
      <li>Saw a bar at Whole Foods and then of course found this better deal on Amazon</li>
      <li>Over all for $14 for 6 bars not a bad value.</li>
      <li>The soap is a great scrub and detox that works extremely well.</li>
      <li>The very first time that I used it, I was scrubbing my chest and was hit in the face with the scent of fishy seaweed.</li>
      <li>I just took my first shower with this seaweed soap and it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The soap actually does a nice job cleaning and softening my hands.</li>
      <li>This is a good soap overall, but what I was looking for was something very seaweed-ish.</li>
      <li>Great soap, initially I did not feel anything, but in my second shower, the soap felt rough and I felt it was great exfoliator.</li>
      <li>The scent is very clean and natural, not fake &amp;#34;laundry</li>
      <li>love seaweed as a detoxifer...went whole hog and did a seaweed salt bath, seaweed mask and used this seaweed soap bar in a very relaxing, very detoxifying pamper session</li>
      <li>I certainly like that it&#x27;s got a lot of natural ingredients in it, which, to my mind, is way better than all the chemicals put into the liquid soaps we put on pouf anyway.  </li>
      <li>and it was (to me) just as soothing and satisfying as going to a spa for a seaweed wrap and facial.</li>
      <li>Will definitely purchase more of these soaps again ...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and finally found it here at a much better price.</li>
      <li>I love this soap and have turned several people onto it.  </li>
      <li>I was able to find the same thing  here on Amazon</li>
      <li>It was not totally horrible, but it was definitely there.</li>
      <li>The scent to me is more like just a plain soap scent, nothing strong and you won&#x27;t leave the shower smelling like the soap.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and squeaky clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>and it make the body feel soft and clean all the time ..</li>
      <li>I have very dry itchy skin and wanted something more like a posh snarky bar, which has a lot of scrubbing power, but is overpriced in my opinion.</li>
      <li>And it ships fast.</li>
      <li>Gives a very &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I will keep an eye out for that and see if it really is the soap giving me this reaction.</li>
      <li>I really like that I can use it to scrub my body</li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>Not too much perfume, and</li>
      <li>Even when I travel, this bar is easy to slice into single use sizes.  </li>
      <li>it does the basic job, but nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>I had been buying handmade seaweed/kelp soap for about a year (your skin feels very soft after this type of soap; you really do feel &#x27;</li>
      <li>My opinion would have been to add a little more flowery scent to it.</li>
      <li>(I rarely shop at that local store).</li>
      <li>I have ordered this several times, and product is consistent, long lasting and great on skin that needs some attention due to irritation from rash, heat, insect bites or psoriasis.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re not making it up), but the lady I was buying it from stopped making it, too busy.</li>
      <li>It lathers up quite well and has all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 y.o. woman with sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the seaweed soap and this is a great price. Shipping as described, on time.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and have used it off and on for years.  The scent is very clean and natural, not fake &amp;#34;laundry detergent&amp;#34; clean.  It&#x27;s a strong, clean scent.  Very scrubby with seaweed particles, I find it great for cellulite, leaves skin noticeably tighter and smoother.  Use caution if you have very sensitive or dry skin.  Gives a very &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling.  I love it, but it may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> I once heard of this being oil defat soap. It&#x27;s not, but if you&#x27;re not used to roughness, be careful with this soap. I love it, but the little microbs really scrub your dead skin cells and it can hurt if you really push down hard. It smells so good and you feel so refreshed afterwards. &lt;3 I can&#x27;t stress how much I love this soap! And it ships fast.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!!!! I am one of those people who hate the feeling that soap leaves on you!!!! But this soap feels so good!!!! The first bar I got was from a friend I searched all over for this soap found some soaps that said seaweed soap but in no way where they!!! You don&#x27;t know how happy I am to have found the soap!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!! I will be ordering again to make sure I don&#x27;t run out!!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using Reviva Seaweed Soap for years and it&#x27;s the only soap I like. I&#x27;m 50 y.o. woman with sensitive skin.  Even when I travel, this bar is easy to slice into single use sizes.  I use many Reviva Labs products and have always been pleased.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of chances to use this soap yet, but for the times I have used it I do like it and I do feel it will get out it what I want.</li>
    <li> The soap bars are ok. I really like that I can use it to scrub my body, feels wonderful! The smell is not bad either, not great, but not bad. I originally purchased this to see if it would improve the texture of my skin. It seems to have done a pretty good job. My skin looks shinier and healthier ever since I began to use the soap. One bar of soap also seems to last pretty long (I go through one per month), though I may have to leave that up to others to decide if that is a good durable time since before using these bars I only ever used liquid body wash. Nonetheless, it seems to work ok for me for the meantime.     The only thing I&#x27;m a little concerned about is tiny red bumps I&#x27;ve been getting, like a small rash, in areas like my legs and arms. This is why I gave four stars instead of five. My skin is very sensitive to specific ingredients. I&#x27;ve always found that I have to keep changing products until I find the one for me. I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m having some type of allergic reaction to an ingredient of the soap. I will keep an eye out for that and see if it really is the soap giving me this reaction. Other than that, the soap is not so bad, but I&#x27;m not sure if I would order them again, especially since summer is coming and I want to be able to show my legs. I will probably keep searching for an alternative.</li>
    <li> Very Sharp on skin! Unbelievable &amp;#62; You dont know until after return deadline.  I should have used in homemade laundry detreg.  At the time I just knew I couldnt donate it - unusable. WASTE OF $</li>
    <li> I love this soap it lather up great and doesn&#x27;t make your skin sticky.  It smells healthy because of the seaweed but it doesn&#x27;t stink. I did notice a slimming effect too.It goes a long away too. It is a must buy.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I&#x27;ve used for many many years!</li>
    <li> I love this soap and have turned several people onto it.  It is not drying and leaves my sking feeling good.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Great soap, initially I did not feel anything, but in my second shower, the soap felt rough and I felt it was great exfoliator. My skin is soft and squeaky clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> This is a good soap overall, but what I was looking for was something very seaweed-ish. This soap smells nothing like seaweed (I know, that&#x27;s probably a good thing to most people), but does smell like flowers. If I want flowers, I&#x27;ll buy everyone else&#x27;s soap. I bought this soap specifically for the seaweed content, as I like to do at-home spa treatments. I am currently using a black African soap and an espresso soap in my regimen, and wanted to add this seaweed soap to the mix. After trying it, I demoted it to a regular hand-washing soap, and will be buying seaweed powder for my spa treatments instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is just my personal preference. The soap actually does a nice job cleaning and softening my hands.</li>
    <li> My fav soap.  This goes on/off easy and nice light smell.</li>
    <li> love seaweed as a detoxifer...went whole hog and did a seaweed salt bath, seaweed mask and used this seaweed soap bar in a very relaxing, very detoxifying pamper session and it was (to me) just as soothing and satisfying as going to a spa for a seaweed wrap and facial. will definitely use this in the shower too as it removes the older skin, leaving the skin softer, smoother, cleaner and seemingly, healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no cellulite improvement, but it does make one feel fully scrubbed.  Probably best as a novelty gift.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on your skin!</li>
    <li> Best soap ever leaves your skin very smooth and eliminates toxins and cellulite I love it I use it every day !</li>
    <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just took my first shower with this seaweed soap and it is fantastic. I am a guy and like green type soaps. This feels and smells great! Not too much perfume, and I like the little specks in the soap that make it have a scrubbing action. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Smells clean and fresh, and the scrubbing action is great for my complexion.  Not drying, but I mostly use it in the summer.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best soap ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and finally found it here at a much better price.</li>
    <li> I this soap it is amazing. I noticed improvement with in 3 days.  It leaves your skin amazingly soft and the smell is quite Suttle.</li>
    <li> So glad I found it again, I used to use this a few years back and then was never able to find it.  Saw a bar at Whole Foods and then of course found this better deal on Amazon</li>
    <li> I have ordered this several times, and product is consistent, long lasting and great on skin that needs some attention due to irritation from rash, heat, insect bites or psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This soap cleans well, lathers nicely, and smells great.  it is a bit odd seeing bits of seaweed, but it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Bought second time already. Will keep buying. My husband likes it because of the scrub effect.</li>
    <li> Mine and my hubby&#x27;s favorite soap of all time!</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap makes my skin feel.  It has scrubby bits in it that slough off the dry, dead skin, leaving my skin feeling revitalized and fresh. As to any thoughts that it may remove cellulite, I can&#x27;t speak to that, but I think that&#x27;s a losing battle, no matter what product you use. Nevertheless, I have become a fan of this soap.  I certainly like that it&#x27;s got a lot of natural ingredients in it, which, to my mind, is way better than all the chemicals put into the liquid soaps we put on pouf anyway.  Skip the liquid slime on a scrub sponge, and get the naturally-inspired, one-step scrubby bar of Reviva soap!</li>
    <li> love the product:)  makes your skin feel awesome</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!!!! IT EXFOLIATES AS IT CLEANS.</li>
    <li> I purchased another seaweed soap for the detox qualities, but it did not seem to do anything. I bathe with this one and the scrubbing action is great. Also, my skin feels softer. I will continue to purchase unless I find something stronger (which I doubt).</li>
    <li> First of all, this soap works really good. It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t really leave my skin dry. I also use Reviva Labs Oatmeal soap and that one leaves my skin dry compared to this seaweed one. I dinged a star for the fishy odor that this soap has. The very first time that I used it, I was scrubbing my chest and was hit in the face with the scent of fishy seaweed. It was not totally horrible, but it was definitely there. It seems that when the bar is lathered is when the scent of the fishy seaweed comes out. However, it does not leave the scent of fishy seaweed on your skin. For that, I am happy. My opinion would have been to add a little more flowery scent to it. It reminded me of a Musubi Seaweed Wrap from L&amp;L Hawaiian Barbecue..... I don&#x27;t like those, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good product and would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind the smell</li>
    <li> it does the basic job, but nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap that feels silky on the skin. It has light scrubbing power, which is not what I wanted. I have very dry itchy skin and wanted something more like a posh snarky bar, which has a lot of scrubbing power, but is overpriced in my opinion. Over all for $14 for 6 bars not a bad value. The scent to me is more like just a plain soap scent, nothing strong and you won&#x27;t leave the shower smelling like the soap. It actually smell soft and I like it. As for cellulite, this isn&#x27;t what I purchased it for and I haven&#x27;t used it enough to tell. I will say that if it does help with cellulite, then the effects would be temporary, because a cream or soap will not get rid of it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Helps removes dead skin cells but does not dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present from a friend and now I am buying it for me and my daughters.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> I had been buying handmade seaweed/kelp soap for about a year (your skin feels very soft after this type of soap; you really do feel &#x27;refreshed&#x27;-- they&#x27;re not making it up), but the lady I was buying it from stopped making it, too busy. So I ordered a different kelp soap here at Amazon (can&#x27;t remember brand, but I dont like to leave bad reviews unless something is downright useless-- it had too much perfume in it, my fault for not reading the ingredients list carefully enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found a bar of THIS stuff in a health food store and tried it and EUREKA! -- this is it. I was able to find the same thing  here on Amazon and I just love it, it&#x27;s perfect! (I rarely shop at that local store). I get the 6-bar pack and use about a bar a month(just for showers). Very pleased! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love seaweed soap but I hate the smell of this. Too bad because I purchased a six pack; I&#x27;m going to throw them all away.</li>
    <li> I purchased Reviva Labs Seaweed Soap for my teenage daughter who has terrible case of acne. After using this soap, results were seen in just a few days. Using this soap and drinking plenty of water has made a remarkable difference in my daughter&#x27;s skin. The soap is a great scrub and detox that works extremely well. I am very satisfied with the product and have started to use it myself and my skin feels rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing it does have a sliming affect.. and it make the body feel soft and clean all the time .. Will definitely purchase more of these soaps again ...</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It works well as an exfoliant and even better as a toner. The seaweed helps to fight cellulite and tighten skin.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the seaweed soap at a local grocery store; but since then, has discontinued it.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know... find something you like, and then it&#x27;s GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, it was available on Amazon, and I&#x27;d rather buy in quantities anyways, so this fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this seller, and more than pleased with the soap. It lathers up quite well and has all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful soap.  It makes you feel clean without drying your skin.  It also sloughs off dead skin.  I use it in the shower and my husband is now using it and loves it as well.</li>
