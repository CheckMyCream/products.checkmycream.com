      <li>We used to joke how the name Gucci by Gucci is ultra ego but deservingly  </li>

      <li>This happens to be my favorite scent of the 20 or so that I own.  </li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>Love it great price fast shipment</li>
      <li>AND I REALLY LOVE THE SIZE OF THE BOTTLES</li>
      <li>The one I purchased here on Amazon, though, is much better price as in Sephora.</li>
      <li>Her sense of smell is much better than me.</li>
      <li>one of my most favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>She says she will leave me if I change it :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing and radiantly elegant fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have purchased from the store and it cost so much more.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve received.</li>
      <li>Macy&#x27;s wanted $30 more for this.  </li>
      <li>This is some of the best colonge that I have encountered in a very long time.</li>
      <li>I also thank Amazon for its reasonable price, fast shipping and excellent customer care and service.</li>
      <li>I use this fragrance and really love and enjoy this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Good and Fast . ...</li>
      <li>I liked  it so much that I made the mistake of buying the&amp;#34;Guicci by Guicci Sport&amp;#34; version and and &amp;#34;Guicci Pour Homme&amp;#34;, and neither one is appealing to me at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this one easily fits in this range of smells, so</li>
      <li>The best part is I actually like it myself, and here in Amazon the price is right.</li>
      <li>The woody scent is pleasant, outdoorsy and masculine.</li>
      <li>trip out of the country involved a visit to the duty free.</li>
      <li>It may not be powerful, but I love it and so does everybody else.</li>
      <li>if you like one of these, you will hopefully enjoy this one.</li>
      <li>Not over powering, I enjoy wearing it often.</li>
      <li>The bottle looked genuine and I thought something was off with me.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and if it&#x27;s not authentic it smells just as nice.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and was factory sealed in the original retail box.  </li>
      <li>glad you had it available, thanks</li>
      <li>I most certainly reccomend buying products from this seller.</li>
      <li>If this does not get that special someone in the mood .....</li>
      <li>I wear this fragrance on special occasions.</li>
      <li>cologne has a good longevity and lasts through out the entire day.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 41 year old husband for father&#x27;s day after going into Macy&#x27;s and finding the scent I really liked for him.  </li>
      <li>and they gave a full refund, immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Still out</li>
      <li>It seems to disappear fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>By the way this is a great price for Gucci, and it is probably heavily discounted because it comes shrink wrapped.</li>
      <li>nothing short of amazing customer service...</li>
      <li>I went right on Amazon using my phone and checked prices and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
      <li>Very particular , mild oaky fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is a wonderfully balanced and complex scent that merges traditionally masculine woodsy scents with a tobacco essence that adds complexity.</li>
      <li>Cologne is a personal taste but this is my favorite right now.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Either they are, which i strongly doubt, i know how to spot the difference, but old most likely.</li>
      <li>fast shipping!</li>
      <li>my wife loves it,cool crisp scent</li>
      <li>Just a heads up for those that believe Macys colognes and perfumes are better because they last longer.....</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it is one of the few colognes my wife said immediately, \\&quot;Oh, I like that!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>smells very alcohol-y..</li>
      <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>have been wearing this frangrance for some time, so I could compare a real bottle (from a dept. store) and what arrived here.</li>
      <li>It smells very manly.</li>
      <li>MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASE</li>
      <li>However, this was the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Delivered fast</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the rapid delivery of the product which matches all the specifications.</li>
      <li>it was everything I expected I will be buying more Cologne soon</li>
      <li>The bottle is real, the package was carefully shipped, and the bottle authentic as well.</li>
      <li>got it really fast &amp; will enjoy it; as my other bottle is almost empty ... nice shipping job ,,, packed with care ...</li>
      <li>I cannot describe the smells of this cologne, but other colognes I have enjoyed are Beyond Paradise, Pleasures and Metropolis by Lauder, and Roadster by Cartier.  </li>
      <li>I like this product, and I think many other do too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came in the box with clear wrap as shown in the picture, and the bottle is exactly like the one in the store.  </li>
      <li>but i later found out that it was a very good bootleg.</li>
      <li>It is a classic.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my older brother.  </li>
      <li>The smell does not stays for long .... is this original Gucci</li>
      <li>The printing on the fake one was blurry and off-center, while the real bottle has very fine precise printing.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my 41 year old husband for father&#x27;s day after going into Macy&#x27;s and finding the scent I really liked for him.  Macy&#x27;s wanted $30 more for this.  I went right on Amazon using my phone and checked prices and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  The clerk said it was probably not authentic, but I have no doubt that it&#x27;s authentic.  It came in the box with clear wrap as shown in the picture, and the bottle is exactly like the one in the store.  Anyhow, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and if it&#x27;s not authentic it smells just as nice.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Have been using thus for years. It&#x27;s a refreshing and radiantly elegant fragrance. Love it!</li>
    <li> This particular bottle seemed to be watered down. smells very alcohol-y..not sure if it is THE AUTHENTIC item...</li>
    <li> This happens to be my favorite scent of the 20 or so that I own.  The woody scent is pleasant, outdoorsy and masculine. I liked  it so much that I made the mistake of buying the&amp;#34;Guicci by Guicci Sport&amp;#34; version and and &amp;#34;Guicci Pour Homme&amp;#34;, and neither one is appealing to me at all.  Next time I&#x27;ll get a sample first...</li>
    <li> Smells the same as the product you would find in macys but for some reason the smell fades incredibly fast, with 30 minutes is gone, not long lasting all, when the reason I bought this fragrance was because I tried a sample from macys and when I got a few hours later I could still smell it, definitely not the case here, spend the extra $30 and buy it in a store</li>
    <li> Great cologne. This is the second one I purchased for my hubby. The one I purchased here on Amazon, though, is much better price as in Sephora. the same smell, same quality.</li>
    <li> Either they are, which i strongly doubt, i know how to spot the difference, but old most likely. Called Amazon and they said to keep them and they gave a full refund, immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Still out two(2) colognes though, im in Jamaica man !!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best colonge that I have encountered in a very long time.If this does not get that special someone in the mood .....nothing will!!!!</li>
    <li> Great Scent, lots of comments...</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of this for Christmas gifts; and when they arrived, they were just shrink-wrapped and rolled in bubble wrap, and not in a box.  The receipt included had a sentence highlighted in yellow saying \\&quot;New - unboxed (PLEASE NOTE:  THIS DOES NOT COME IN A BOX).\\&quot;  However, I did not see this in the product description when I ordered them.  This makes me a little concerned that it is not authentic Gucci cologne.</li>
    <li> Just a heads up for those that believe Macys colognes and perfumes are better because they last longer..... They put extra oil in the testers to make them last longer! I know this because I worked for fragrance dept!! So don&#x27;t think Amazon is any different than what you get at Macys. They use that trick to sell the fragrance. Just a heads up! Happy Shopping!! By the way this is a great price for Gucci, and it is probably heavily discounted because it comes shrink wrapped. Meaning if you can go without the box, you will save some money!!</li>
    <li> I found this cologne in the duty-free section while travelling abroad.  I saved $20+ to buy this via Amazon upon my return.  The pacakage was in excellent condition, shipped quickly and the smell is awesome.  Most importantly, it is one of the few colognes my wife said immediately, \\&quot;Oh, I like that!\\&quot;  I cannot describe the smells of this cologne, but other colognes I have enjoyed are Beyond Paradise, Pleasures and Metropolis by Lauder, and Roadster by Cartier.  I&#x27;d say this one easily fits in this range of smells, so if you like one of these, you will hopefully enjoy this one.</li>
    <li> I just received mine and the cap is plastic not metal like the ones i buy from the store, Also this one has no sent to it , like spraying water. I have contacted seller to return. Disappointed , time and money wasted.... Hope seller doesn&#x27;t give me issues returning it, I should have read reviews seems like a lot of people having same issues with this brand or seller</li>
    <li> I smelled this fragrance before and it smelt great  but i later found out that it was a very good bootleg. But THIS ONE IS REAL AND SMELLS AMAZING!!! The bottle is real, the package was carefully shipped, and the bottle authentic as well.I most certainly reccomend buying products from this seller.</li>
    <li> I read around and there where several reviews that mentioned counterfeit product but I was very happy to receive the genuine thing.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the rapid delivery of the product which matches all the specifications. It is a great product and I like it</li>
    <li> My husband bought one of this once and it&#x27;s not the same fragance, I don&#x27;t know if they change it but is not the same</li>
    <li> I wanna express my opinion toward the product. all things were done perfectly. the product was that which I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. I have purchased from the store and it cost so much more. I found this on amazon and it is twice the size for half the price! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> It doesnt not smell for very long</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> THIS FRANGANCE IS PERFECT</li>
    <li> I love this scent very exotic woodsy smell to me. Delivered fast</li>
    <li> Bought this for my older brother.  Smells great,.. I might have to buy a bottle for myself, best price on the web here.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I wear this fragrance on special occasions.</li>
    <li> It smells very manly. Probably like chuck Norris after a fight with a grizzly bear.  If i had to take a guess, I would figure it was made from raw testosterone and kitten tears.  It&#x27;s the type of smell women hide in fear over.  Definitely not something to wear around your grandma.</li>
    <li> Very particular , mild oaky fragrance. It is a classic. I don&#x27;t like citrusy fragrances and this is just perfect</li>
    <li> I use this fragrance and really love and enjoy this fragrance. I also thank Amazon for its reasonable price, fast shipping and excellent customer care and service.</li>
    <li> my wife LOVES this one.  got a few positive comments from others too.</li>
    <li> I do feel that over the years this product has changed. I think it is not as long lasting as it was years ago. It seems to evaporate or possibly be diluted a bit. I still like the fragrance!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASE ON HOW THIS SMELL.I&#x27;M HAPPY HE LIKE IT AND I REALLY LOVE THE SIZE OF THE BOTTLES</li>
    <li> Was my first and last time to buy a parfume online, The one I bought from the store smell stay more than a day In my cloths, the one I bought online hardly can smell after 1 h, I believe it&#x27;s fake.</li>
    <li> one of my most favorite perfume. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells the best! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cologne for men.  It is a wonderfully balanced and complex scent that merges traditionally masculine woodsy scents with a tobacco essence that adds complexity. It has hints of cypress, bergamot, amber, jasmine, and violet and it is a moderate scent suitable for casual occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne has a good longevity and lasts through out the entire day.</li>
    <li> ATT: Gucci&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last 4 years your Gucci by Gucci became my signature cologne. I just stopped wearing anything else. The feedback I got  was amazing. Bouncers in clubs, friends, strangers would ask me to what I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Every trip out of the country involved a visit to the duty free. You get my point....&lt;br /&gt;several months ago I purchased the the 90 ml bottle from Amazon. Something was off with the scent. Like it was diluted, like it lost its potency. I smelled more alcohol than usual. The bottle looked genuine and I thought something was off with me. After reading some reviews, I read allegations of counterfeit. I called Amazon and complained. The problem was that I used about 15% of it. In spite of it, customer service wished I didn&#x27;t use it, but they set up a return. Amazon was asking the vendor to set up a return and promised me if the vendor will refuse, they will provide refund and go after the vendor. nothing short of amazing customer service...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned that I was messing with another livelihood, I went to Macy&#x27;s and got a new bottle. The smell was the same. I tested it on my co-workers. They all said the one from Macy&#x27;s was actually even weaker. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the deal with that, but this is such shame. It used to be such an amazing long lasting cologne. Now I need to drown myself with it, and the scent just dissipate in short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I wanted to express my concern. I like this product, and I think many other do too.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I&#x27;d like to return it for my purchase price. I will mail it back at my expense. My girlfriend is completely in agreement with me how the product lost its potency comparing to the one from the time we started our relationship. Her sense of smell is much better than me. We used to joke how the name Gucci by Gucci is ultra ego but deservingly  so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add here I left a voice mail in your 800 # since &amp;#34;all rep where busy helping others&amp;#34;. No one called me back.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you will replay to this email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance now for about 4 years. Can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve received. The best part is I actually like it myself, and here in Amazon the price is right.</li>
    <li> Love it great price fast shipment</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t settle for any other cologne!&lt;br /&gt;So glad you had it available, thanks</li>
    <li> A heavier fragrance for city nights, it clings to you the same way she will all evening</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. I just hope it smells good good too. Its a gift to a friend and cant opn it till the  next 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is a great gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fany of all GUCCI Mens Fragerances,  and for this cheap, and price, it&#x27;s perfect! I love this cologne.</li>
    <li> The smell does not stays for long .... is this original Gucci</li>

    <li> Great gift for any occasion and smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is a fake! The Gucci by Gucci EDT I ordered came in a fake, cheap bottle and the EDT itself was very similar, but had some fruity-floral undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this frangrance for some time, so I could compare a real bottle (from a dept. store) and what arrived here. The fake bottle had a plastic cap with marks from the molding on it, while the real one is metal. The printing on the fake one was blurry and off-center, while the real bottle has very fine precise printing. The fake bottle was slightly smaller, and was asymmetrical; the angling on the corners was mismatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of which is beside the point, which is that the actual product was not the same. It&#x27;s very difficult to tell with fragrances, for sure, but the fake definitely didn&#x27;t have any staying power--it faded within minutes--plus the above, about smelling slightly more fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY dissatisfied</li>
    <li> Gucci by Gucci is a great fragrance.  I receive compliments about it all the time.  My only issue with the fragrance is how long it lasts.  It seems to disappear fairly quickly.  I am up to using 4 sprays at a time and I have had people tell me to spray more, because of they say it is not strong enough.  It may not be powerful, but I love it and so does everybody else.</li>
    <li> Very subtle and nice fragrance. Not over powering, I enjoy wearing it often.</li>
    <li> Cologne is a personal taste but this is my favorite right now. The only one that comes even close is Chanel Bleu.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing.  I was somewhat fearful of getting a fake product as many reviews stated.  However, this was the real thing.  Amazon delivered it on time and I am just about to order my second one.  Buy with confidence from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend smells so good.</li>
    <li> been using for years... great frangance</li>
    <li> Love the scent, it&#x27;s longetivity is very poor (at least on me).  Last just a few hours.  Still I like it.</li>
    <li> My signature smell. I already finished 6 or 7 bottles. Wooden, a little bi spicy. My fiance loves it. She says she will leave me if I change it :) Give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband for Christmas.  It was about HALF the price that I had found it at departments stores.  It arrived on time and was factory sealed in the original retail box.  My husband loves it!</li>
