<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hairdryer is like a mini blowout.  My hair has a natural wave that I don&#x27;t like, so I either have to straighten or curl it everyday.  With this hair dryer, I can use the attachment and not have to do either.  It doesn&#x27;t look as good as when I straighten it, but for everyday, non special occasions it&#x27;s great. it&#x27;s also really small so it&#x27;s easy to travel with.  Also, the most genius thing about it is a cover over the back of it.  it keeps it from sucking in your hair on accident.</li>
    <li> I came on time and works very well on my long hair.</li>
    <li> OMG!  This hairdryer is awesome! I was skeptical when I first ordered it.  It was inexpensive - and really? Could it actually do what it says?  But, I figured since the attachment was removable I could still go back to the old way of blow drying and then using my flat iron. WAS I WRONG!!!!!  I set it at 4, just like the book told me to.  On day 1 - without ever having used it before, it took me only 8 minutes to do my hair.  8 MINUTES!!!!!!!!! Typically, it would take at least 10 to blow dry and 10 to flat iron.  I have cut my time down over half!!!!  My hair is very thick and wavy.  I don&#x27;t even have to touch up with a flat iron. AND - my hair is straighter using this hair dryer than using my flat iron. EASY to use. My hair is softer when I&#x27;m done. And, I&#x27;ve even stopped using other products in it because the oil strip that comes with is just enough to make my hair lovely.  HOLY SMOKES!  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! I am an African American female with shoulder length natural hair.  After blow drying my hair with the Infiniti Pro, there is no need for me the use the flat iron.  My hair dries silky straight every time.</li>
    <li> Great Hair dryer and smoother in one. Works great because it straightens but I can still use a curling iron and put curl back in unlike a flat iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for the holidays. We got it for her and she loves it! It straightens her hair easily and it takes her less time. She loves it! It does get hot after you use it, however she doesn&#x27;t really mind.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Love it.  I have 4a natural hair with frizzy corkscrew curls.  This blowdryer really does detangle and smooth my hair out.  I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to do the roundbrush technique by myself. Cut my drying time down by 15 mins.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ive been buying these for years! They do a fantastic job straightening hair. Takes me 5 minutes to dry AND straighten my hair and my hair is just past shoulder length.  They last a long time with everyday use. Ive had to buy 3 in the last 10 years. Leaves hair smooth and shiny. Easy to use when you get the hang of it. My 10 yr daughter uses it too and loves it.</li>
    <li> Worked great, just blow dry in small sections.</li>
    <li> I have 4ab curls that I stretch to prevent and reduce tangling.  This helps SO MUCH!!!  I was using the tension method previously.  I used the dryer on low to reduce the chance of heat damage.  I am so impressed that my hair was stretched and detangled when I finished drying.  This saved me several steps.  Normally I shampoo/condition and detangle, add leave-in, detangle again, stretch-dry and band my hair (by now I&#x27;m tired so I stop for the day) .  The next day or whenever I re-moisturize, I have to detangle again.  With this dryer I won&#x27;t have to do the last detangling step which means I can actually style my hair!  It isn&#x27;t perfect for Black hair (as in Black people), which is why I gave it four stars but it is the closest thing I&#x27;ve seen to a product designed for those of us that have to stretch their natural hair.  (Dear Conair, the design could be tweaked for Black hair and you&#x27;d make a killing!)  I noticed that I snapped some of my ends if I wasn&#x27;t careful but I will adjust my technique going forward.  Overall this is a must have for me.  Saw a tutorial on youtube (My Natural Sistahs) and for that they have my lifelong enduring gratitude!!!</li>
    <li> Works as described, I am very satisfied with the way it works</li>
    <li> Works great for natural hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this same dryer for over 5 years and use it daily.  It does the job, is durable and is well constructed. I bought the new one as a back-up as 5 years is a long time.  The only down side is that it is heavier than most other dryers.  I was hoping the newer model would weigh less but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It dried my hair quickly &amp; made it very soft.</li>
    <li> I never do reviews, but this blow dryer is the truth! I have very tightly curled natural hair and I have never used a blow dryer that got my hair so well blown out in so little time. It took me 20-25 minutes to do my whole head on detangled damp hair, and that&#x27;s with stopping to &amp;#34;ooo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;aah&amp;#34; over the results. Super soft, shiny, and straight with no breakage.</li>
    <li> I purchase this dryer after all the positive reviews from the natural ladies about the ease of drying and the fact that it stretches your hair.  Umm...it has not been that great for me.  It snags my hair and I have to be careful or I get tangles.  It is easier to use than my other dryer so I will keep it, but still not as great as I expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool! Wish I had purchased it sooner.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased one of these about 2 years ago and it works great to straighten my hair as I&#x27;m blowdrying it.  The first one died on me, and I got this second one.  The first one was available in a wine color, but the new one is a blueish/purple which I think looks much better.</li>
    <li> True to what some of the other reviews were saying, that it does cut your drying time in half and gets your hair straighter and the shine is awesome.  Love it!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This thing is surprisingly effective. Makes blowdrying hair a lot easier!!</li>
    <li> I have a love / hate relationship with this one. As a hair dryer it works awesome. But for someone with thick hair as myself the straightener can be somewhat of a challenge. For those with thick and a lot of hair it my take a few tries to get your hair straight. Honestly, I just give up half way and end up using my straigteber to finish the job, lol</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH, where has this been my whole life?!?!  The first time I used it, my hair went from sopping wet and unmanageable to smooth, sleek hair in 10 minutes. By the second use, I had it down to 6 minutes. Unbelievable!! I&#x27;ve recommended this product for all of my friends already!</li>
    <li> We love the Argan oil distribution feature and the blow works really well. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Needed a new hair dryer and saw this one had good reviews when used on kinky natural hair. Once I figured out how to use it correctly (placement of the combs and such) it worked well. Also a relief to deal with a unit where the combs are embedded in the machine instead of dealing with attachments that pop off too easily. Cut my hair drying time in half and my arm didn&#x27;t feel like I had pitched 7 innings afterward.</li>
    <li> does work well for curly hair to straighten or diffuse it and leave it curly.</li>
    <li> I love using this to blow out my natural hair! My hair is really thick and about 8-8.5 inches long now, after growing my natural hair back out 1.5 years ago! As long as you detangle your hair first, it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This styling tool gives my s-curl patterned, African-American hair incredible body, shine, and sleekness. It was initially slightly awkward to use and will likely take you a couple tries to get used to it. The directions recommended starting out with the highest heat setting and with the highest tension setting too. No. You will pull out a lot of hair. I use this blower on the lowest tension setting with low heat. It straightens and dries the hair at the same time, so sectioning the hair is a must. This makes the process slow but flat ironing afterwards takes about a quarter of the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer a little over a month ago and finally had a chance to use it.  I have thick course hair 4B/4C I believe texture wise.  This dryer straightened my hair so straight that I didn&#x27;t need to flat iron my hair.  I will be ordering a second one for standby whenever this one gives out. It does wonders and I thank God I had this hair dryer to quickly blow dry, straighten, and give my hair a silky finish. For real, for real! Get one! 😊</li>
    <li> Works great as a hair dryer but still have to successfully use the comb attachment.  My daughters hairs if both fine, thick (tons of it), and curly (borderline kinky).  Even with combing it out multiple times her hair would get stuck in the combs.</li>
    <li> Had to be returned as not suitable for Australia</li>
    <li> Love it exactly as discribied</li>
    <li> I Dont know how I got through life without owning this. It does wonders!</li>
    <li> Hard to use on Natural African American hair.  My hair is not very kinky or tightly curled and the comb still kept coming off.  I tried using different directions and finally just took the comb off and used my brush to comb out as I dried it.  I could have stuck w/ my regular blow dryer. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I seen this product in a YouTube video so I decided to try it. I am team natural going on 5 yrs. and my hair is bra length. I don&#x27;t really put a lot of heat on my hair. However, I decided to straighten my her for the second time. My results was amazing due to the infinity pro blow dryer. My blowout was amazing.</li>
    <li> No more ouch, no more having to dry my hair for house just to get desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you add leave-in conditioner or liquid pomade to you hair prior to blow drying; use a slightly damped wet towel to hold the dryer. I found that it really helps keep the dyer slipping out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to credit kismera hair products,( bought from amazon ) which made the process very painless</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hair dryer!!!! It&#x27;s one of the best dryer that I have ever used. My hair got straight, it was soft, smooth, shiny, and it had a lot of body. It took me 20 minutes to blow dry my whole head. The dryer blow dries my hair quickly without me have to spend a lot of time on my hair. Also, I like how small it is and the handle is nice. I like that it can also curl your hair which is great. Overall, I had fun blow drying my hair, and I would probably do it often because it would take less time.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer for straightening hair. My family have very curl hair and this dryer straighten hair very well. Left hair feeling silky and not dried out. Some people complaint about the short handle  and weight but this was not for me. It did have a little more weight then a regular blow dryer but I was able to control the strokes with each pass through strands. I think if they made the head long it would be harder to handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my natural black hair. I wanted something to help reduce style time as well as something that would help me achieve a fluffy blowout. Since I have VERY rough and unruly hair, I was hesitant to spend $40 on a blow dryer but it was worth it. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that it can be a little hard to maneuver (as in to get to your roots) but with practice it&#x27;ll be a breeze. If I could change one thing about it I would want the cool setting to be a button you don&#x27;t have to constantly hold down but otherwise this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this lightweight quick hair dryer. It detangles my hair and dries it super quick.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer for my natural armpit length hair. Gets it very straight and dries in reasonable time frame.</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 of these blow dryers. Each one has met the same fate. In order for the attachments to stay on, the dryer only has two small plastic clips on the side. After some use these clips give out. Now the attachments do not stay on, making this just a poor and expensive normal blow dryer. This latest one didn&#x27;t even make it to 2 years. This was not even used daily, just 3-4 times a week. I have wavy hair on the thick side. Nothing super curly. This has the potential to be a great product if they could find some engineers to fix this obvious design flaw.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works really well for my 4a hairtype!</li>
    <li> I like this dryer. It gets the job done. My hair is very thick , and course. I know that it would only work with me previously detangling it but I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not sure how but the comb attachment the plastic piece is loose and came off.</li>
    <li> Love it! The best dryer ever!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Not as advertised either. The product I received was not as advertised. Instead of having the three prongs at the top, I ended up receiving an argon oil strip. Ripped my hair straight from the roots and only has two settings &amp;#34;low and high&amp;#34;, There is no low, medium, high and there is no cold, warm and hot. For the price of this dryer it needs to come with way more settings. I have purchased cheaper blow dryers that come with all settings and temperature adjustment settings.</li>
    <li> I buy this merely because of the colour. I already know of the outcome of using this as I have the same one in wine colour. When arrived, I try it immediately just to make sure it produces similar results, which it does and even slightly better - smooth, natural looking straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have been shopping around for this thing for a few months and Im&lt;br /&gt;glad that I found it here.&lt;br /&gt;Very authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;Makes blow outs so much easier to do, in less time and with less struggle.</li>
    <li> As described. In perfect condition. Works like a dream. A great replacement for my old hair dryer. I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
    <li> i loved this dryer! my new staple!</li>
    <li> Took a min to get the hang of..... But it works great!</li>
    <li> I loves the smaller Infinity straightening dryer but they break after just a few uses--and they are expensive.  I thought I would try this.  It&#x27;s not nearly as easy or as effective....but I&#x27;m hoping it lasts better anyway.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these five years ago when the price was around $20 a piece. It has been a lifesaver many times for me. I have extremely hard to manage hair. It&#x27;s coarse, coily and thick. My hair type is 4c with a little 4d, so those of you 4c/4d ladies know what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, conditioning, applying various products including Lotta Body Coconut and Shea Style Milk (that I have recently started using and have had very good results) and untangling my hair, I use the Infiniti to dry and straighten my hair. If your hair tends to knot up, start from the bottom and work your way up. It really works very well. My hair ends up being so soft, straight and has a nice fragrance. You may need to adjust the tension of the Infiniti accordingly for your hair. I put it on the highest setting for my hair. I still have the second one still in the box. The first one has lasted so long and still works like new, I haven&#x27;t needed to open the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other plus to this, is that it works really well with straightening synthetic kanekelon or Marley hair (get a brand that is heat resistent like Vanessa). It leaves the the hair soft and straight (not necessarily bone straight) when used with the Lotta Body Styling Milk ($4.49 at my local beauty supply shop).</li>
    <li> I love how my hair comes out.</li>
    <li> This product was bought because I was curious about the brush attachment. It is very acuward to use. I would probably have sent it back, but I do like the hair dryer itself. The size is a plus. The only other thing that I would perfer is a longer cord. Maybe better instructions on how to use attachment would alto be helpful.</li>
    <li> Okay so my hair natural I would classify my hair as 4b /4a I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer I use on low setting and my hair was blown strait not mention NO HEAT DAMAGE when I wash my hair. I did not use any curling iron tool just wash and blow out and style as I desire.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever!</li>
    <li> Love this, worked wonders!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still determining if I like this dryer or not. It gets my hair kind of straight but not as straight as I expected. It does help me to manage my hair. For the price, it was a good bargin.</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old and have very curly, course, color treated hair and this hair dryer helped me get salon results when straightening my hair.  I&#x27;ve never been able to blow dry my hair with the use of the round brush.  This hair dryer eliminated the use of the round brush.  No more getting the brush stuck in my hair!  It left my hair so smooth and soft.  I still need to flat iron my iron, but the time is reduced and I am able to use a lower heat setting.  I didn&#x27;t know that a hair dryer could make such a difference.  I&#x27;ve never written a product review in my entire life, but felt compelled to do so with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this blowdryer.  It does exactly what it says.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting use to but great once you get the hang of it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer on May 8, 2015, and it died on August 8, 2015.  I&#x27;m rather disappointed with it due to how quickly it died.  I did like the pretty blue color of the hair dryer and it worked well at drying hair for nearly three months.  But given the short working life, it was a waste of thirty-one dollars. The prior hair dryer that I&#x27;d bought here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043BUW78) lasted about two years, and the hair dryer I had before that worked for over twenty years. All three were made in China, but the first was significantly more durable.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair dryer, the best one I ever had. I don&#x27;t even need a comb! My hair is curly and big and I had no problem to dry it. And looks so straightened that I don&#x27;t need to iron it.</li>
    <li> my natural hair loves it</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was difficult to find in store, but I had heard just how wonderful it was and was glad to find it here on Amazon.  It is super easy to use once you get used to it and I love how it styles my hair while it dries it.  My whole family loves this hair dryer and how quickly it dries their hair.  I also use it to dry clothing when there is a spill and I don&#x27;t want to put one piece in my dryer.  It works great and fast!</li>
    <li> I used this product before. Still the same good quality. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I can get my hair straight in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I think its a great idea of a blow dyer i have used this dryer for many years now and i will never use another dryer thank you</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I&#x27;m a mother of two little kids and don&#x27;t have time to dry my hair, straighten my hair, and then use a flat iron to finish it up.  Normally I end up in a pony tail every day.  I never even knew something like this existed!  I am still learning how to do the more advanced techniques...but the basic one has given me amazing results!  In 20 minutes (the length of one episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse), I can go from wet to sleek!  In addition, I got in the shower with my daughter to help her get cleaned and did not put a cap on my head...my hair did NOT frizz.  it did NOT recurl.  WHAT?!  This is mind blowing!</li>
    <li> I have really thick natural 4b hair and this blow dryer cuts drying time down A LOT(30 min total drying time vs a 1hr or more)  It straightens and leaves your hair shiny.  If your natural or relaxed,  this dryer should be your next purchase.</li>
    <li> I have natural, curly-kinky, type 4A hair and this dryer makes it so much easier to blow dry and straighten my hair while reducing drying time when achieving a blowout.</li>
    <li> I have yet to try the product.  I purchased it to compare this model to the Conair Infinity Tourmaline model.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!!!! You save time and money with this hairdryer. I cound&#x27;t use regular dryers before because I never learned to use the brush in one hand and the dryer in the other...  So this is an amazing solution!</li>
    <li> Love it great product glads through my thick hair very easy without pulling it out. I will definitely purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> dang this thing seems fancy- works well though (so says my wife). also seems to straigten and shine well</li>
    <li> Bristles were too small and my hair kept getting tangled within itself . Difficult to hold too.</li>
    <li> Since I am all natural ... I was a little afraid of putting heat on my hair after 2 years without it.  A little nervous of the damage a blow dryer would cause, but this blow dryer did me justice. Very easy to use with thick curly hair as myself.</li>
    <li> I love it, i have 4c hair and it&#x27;s amazing to blow it out, but don&#x27;t really expect it to make it bone straight.  For coarse hair it works better as a blowdryer, I was happy with that anyways.</li>
    <li> I already had one. I used it twice a week for 5 years. This is the hair dryer for me. I´m not good with brushes, so this is the best solution to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I will never know how it works, its just for 110V, you need to be an electricity huy to undertand it</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. I have used it to do my wash and goes and so far i love it. It&#x27;s very light weight and reduces my dry time in half.</li>
    <li> The best dryer ever... It takes the work out of straightening 4a/4b hair. I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron as high because the dryer does most of the work.  I highly recommend this dryer</li>
    <li> Best Hairdryer, Small Relatively quiet . Fast Drying, Leaves my hair smooth and shiney&lt;br /&gt;Was easy to Order. Came very quickly LOVE Amazon</li>
    <li> I first bought this hair dryer in 2004. I am just now in 2015 purchasing a new one...and not because the hair dryer no longer works. I just got tiered of cleaning out the comb attachment and I wasn&#x27;t able to just find that to purchase. It literally shaves your straightening time by more than half. I have very curly, thick ethnic hair and this blow dryer never fails to give me an easy salon quality blow out. I have owned many many blow dryers in my life time. And all of them had that plastic comb attachment. The 3-in-1 is the most exceptional hair tool I have ever purchased along side my Chi flat iron. I highly suggest this item for anyone who struggles with the round brush method. Additionally this blow dryer gives out some serious heat and the cooling button is perfect for naturally curly styles...or days when the central ac is broken :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Even after straightening your hair you will have to use a curling iron or rollers.  More time consuming than what I do now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this dryer! I have tried so many different kinds: ones with and without combs and brushes. It usually takes me well over an hour to blow dry my very coarse, natural hair. And this did the job in less than 45 minutes. My arms were not tired, and my hair was completely dry, even at the roots! I didn&#x27;t have to do a ton of detangling before or after using it. I used it on low, and I am very impressed. I don&#x27;t need another dryer, and I hope they don&#x27;t stop producing this one. I have a feeling I&#x27;m gonna use this one until the wheels fall off. :)</li>
    <li> Awesome product. This is is the second one I buy.</li>
    <li> This Hair Dryer is wonderful. I use this hair dryer since it is not in the fall/winter season.  Air drying your hair is not good during 20 degree weather.  If you are a African American Woman with curly hair, this hair dryer will make it bone straight from the roots, to the tips, you do not need a flat iron/pressing comb.  I You can put your hair in flex rods when you hair is still hot if you want curls.  You just have to make sure you hear your attachment clicks into place.  I never had a problem with my attachment falling off.</li>
    <li> I love it! My hair was straight, smoothed and soft! I didn&#x27;t need a flat iron after if I wanted to! I could have put roller or flexirods to achieve heartless curls! Thanks to My natural sistas on YouTube for the suggestion! This proves to me my natural hair didn&#x27;t need any chemicals or lots of heat to be straight! I love it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t straighten my 4c hair and my weaves how I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. Highly recommended on YouTube . Limits the amount of heat needed to stretch my hair.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me and my frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried, but it felt like it was pulling my hair.  Even when I use heavy serums to protect my hair, it still feels damaged after using this... and I get alot of static.  It does straighten my hair, but definately does not leave it silky.  I have 3B hair.  It has the ability to curl tightly, but is usualy barely curly if I don&#x27;t use any product to encourage the curl.  It is easily straightened with a hair drier and I have already gone back to using a normal hair dryer with velcro rollers.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Send it as a gift to my mom and she loves it. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I love it but wish I could change the heat....it super hot. No medium heat hot or cold. Works good though</li>
    <li> I have very coily hair and this did nothing but rip my strands. I will never use it again. I plan to sell it away at our next rummage sale. If your strands are fine and super coily, I don&#x27;t recommend using this. The tension method would be safer and more effective.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. The wind is so strong. But there&#x27;s a little strange smell from it</li>
    <li> Sooooo amazing love it</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! This is amazing. I have super thick, wavy hair. It usually takes me quite a long time to blow dry and I still end up with wavy and random damp spots. But with this dryer, my hair completely dried so quickly and it was the straightest I&#x27;ve ever seen it from just a blow dryer. I&#x27;m in awe. I can&#x27;t even articulate how fabulous this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my thick hair got such great results, I can&#x27;t even imagine how great it would turn out for someone with thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, a replacement for the same model i&#x27;ve had for years. I personally can only use a hairdryer with an attached comb to manage the drying process, so this works for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, exactly what I wanted works excellent on 4c hair!</li>
    <li> This is a thick hair, naturally wavy girls dream. I just didn&#x27;t feel coordinated enough to straighten my long, thick hair with a blow dryer and round brush. I also found my arms getting really tired by the time I finished. This hairdryer is now all I use. I have had 3 now, and although they eventually wear out (2-3 years of use), it really does give you a soft, straight, long-lasting look. I just touch it up with a hot iron and a little shine serum and I look like I&#x27;ve had a professional blow out! I hope Conair doesn&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great blow dryer, it literally cuts drying time in half, with the same results as a regular  dryer. I&#x27;m in lovvveeee with it &amp;#60;3 Seriously a must buy!</li>
    <li> We are still getting use to using it. It&#x27;s not easy to handle initially but I can see use becoming easier with practice. I&#x27;m using it on type 3c hair with the hopes of eliminating the regular use of a flat iron after washes. I will update the review if any major changes are noted</li>
    <li> It only have the extra comb on one side making it hard to do your own hair. Will be returning it to the other conAir.</li>
    <li> Way too awkward to hold and get in the correct position. I sent it back and got the other one that&#x27;s long and narrow. Much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I looooove it! This product does wonders for my natural 4c hair!</li>
    <li> i love thsi procuct I have one and purchased one for my sister</li>
    <li> Straightens hair with minimal effort. Comb plates are sturdy and solid. I purchased to strech out my 4C tight coil natural hair. Works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get my ends straight so my hair is frizzy.</li>
    <li> Excellent and so far the best blow dryer I have ever owned/ if you looking for a quick and easy way to style your hair, I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this hair dryer. The first two times I used it I was rushing and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention and for the third time today I used it and its just wonderful to see how manageable my hair was, soft and smooth. I never got that type of results from any of my past hair dryers and I thank my friend for posting a pic of this hair dryer because it isbthe best and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer does a good job on my 4c hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair bone straight. But makes it more manageable to style. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and it stays soft.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. Before, blow drying my daughter &#x27;s hair was a nightmare, for her and for myself as well. But now I was able to cut the struggle and the time to less than half, I thank #mynaturalsistas  @ youtube for the tip. I will recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I am not sure where to start with my review, first of the dryer is the bom dot com, i mean it is the best I have ever used. I have 4a/b type waist length  natural hair and this cuts my blow out session form 1hr to about 15 minutes yes 15 minutes. Initially i had nots and my hair was being torn out then i realized i was not using it correctly.When using this dryer especially for thicker coarser hair types it is imperative that you start from the very end and work your way up. It is amazing!!! i would totally recommend this to any one, I believe this is for black hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, and healthy hair.  Unfortunately, it was not &amp;#34;love at first use&amp;#34; with my first and only attempt at using this product.  It did not sufficiently straighten my hair as expected.  I had high hopes,  will give another shot before ruling it out and storing with the other misfit gadgets. Not good for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. Best hairdryer she has used. Gives her great volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this dryer. The handle is not the easiest to deal with. I prefer the Infiniti Pro Wet/Dry Styler instead.</li>
    <li> it was  waist of money because it comes in 110v and my house is 220v and can not be change</li>
    <li> Great for straightening hair without a flat iron!  I love this blow dryer!!</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer for those of us with curly hair that are really bad with a flat iron. While, alone it won&#x27;t give you that stick straight hair you would get flat iron, it does get the curl out, without making your hair frizzy and poofy.  I&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer for about 8 years, and it&#x27;s as far as I know, it&#x27;s the only one like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are:  1) after a while the attachment gets loose and 2) it gets pretty hot (which is probably necessary considering it&#x27;s purpose).</li>
    <li> Straightens my natural hair! Takes some getting used to with the proper angling of the comb attachment. My hair has less frizz and more shine. And that&#x27;s on the low heat setting! It&#x27;s small and easy in the hands. Would definitely recommend. I hope it never breaks!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the attachment - I am happy with the size and power.</li>
    <li> gave as a gift she is still trying to figure it out she said but it works ok</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. The best I&#x27;ve had so far. When using this blow dryer it is best to use when hair is semi dry. I don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron after blow drying my hair. I have natural hair type 4 if this helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I notice with this dryer is that it takes less time to dry my hair. I save a good 45 minutes to an hour with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks India from NaturalSistas on Youtube for introducing me to this wonderful tool :)</li>
    <li> I bought this hair designer and I was very excited about it, I bought it internationally. I received it few days ago and I couldn&#x27;t try it, cuz it was written on it 125 volt (our voltage is 220).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying it and I wish I could use it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Natural hair ladies it is a winner just clean it when you are done! My hair is mixture of I guess 4b and c and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed, unfortunately I misunderstood the description of this hairdryer and I believed that I&#x27;d be able to use it in UK but I have not been able to find an affordable power adaptor so I can use the hairdryer safely with our voltage. I have a plug socket adaptor but I cannot use the appliance without the correct power adaptor. It arrived on time in perfect condition though which was excellent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I am a 4C natural hair women and my hair is so soft and full of movement. The best blowout ever with this! ♡♡♡</li>
    <li> I am glad that I made this purchase. It works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly because of the brush attachment.  It&#x27;s often times difficult to use a brush and a hair dryer separately.  This product made my hair poufy...not really what I wanted, but whatever.  It didn&#x27;t really do much in the way of drying when I used it as a brush/dryer.  But when I just used it as a dryer, it worked okay I guess.  It didn&#x27;t really cut my drying time in half, or minimize it.  I&#x27;d say steer clear of this product if you have extremely thick or long hair.  I&#x27;ll just use it as a hair dryer until I find a better product.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! I have tons of curly 4c strands that are very discouraging to even think about blow drying. This dryer has changed my natural hair life</li>
    <li> Great dryer, really works well on course natural hair. Would have given it 5 stars but the unit cracked soon after use.</li>
    <li> love it. i have bra-strap length 4a-4b kinky coily natural hair, so needed a blow dryer that would dry and straighten my hair with out getting snagged. the blow dryers with comb attachment would pull and break my hair or my hair would break the teeths of the combs. this tool works sooo much better. takes some time getting use to it but has greatly reduced hair breakage. i keep the tension level at 4.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. Great job Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and this works like a charm for me . It&#x27;s easy to use and comfortable hold. I can get a salon quality blowout at home.</li>
    <li> It gets my hair dry. Works better on my daughter&#x27;s hair. The strip didn&#x27;t make much difference. I would rather just buy a bottle of the stuff and put it on my hair before drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI most universal blow dry combs won&#x27;t fit it.</li>
    <li> Very good. Works well. It facilitated a lot to deal with my hair. Practical way to get ready to go to work and go out. I really enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does its job. I have really course hair and I get a good stretch from it. But as for the little pink/purplish part that is suppose to leave your hair with a shine.... It doesn&#x27;t work for me, I guess because of my hair type. But other than that I like it. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so I guess after a couple of uses I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Infiniti Pro, using it at first was a little awkward but became much better with use. I am a natural and I love the fullness and softness I get. This was worth the purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Just WOW. I always had issues blow drying, but this method takes away the stress. The teeth are strong and will comb through any texture of hair!</li>
    <li> When I received this hair dryer and opened the box, it was not packaged as new. It was just sitting in the box. It was covered with a small plastic bag which looked very used. No warranty card. The hair dryer works okay but it makes my hair look frizzy. I definitely have to use a flat iron afterwards to straighten and smooth my hair. Oh well, you win some you lose some...  Oh, and I did partially pre dry my hair as recommemded.</li>
    <li> This dryer straightens my thick curly hair great and it causes no heat damage.</li>
    <li> Just received my Infiniti Pro by Conair Hair Designer 3-in-1 Hair Dryer yesterday and I immediately tried it on my bangs and I must say, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight but powerful.  Feels substantial not flimsy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a replacement for a Revlon 1875 Ion Dryer that I had for well over twenty years and I finally dropped it one time too many and it cracked and although it was still working I wanted a new, lighter dryer and this one fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s going to have a learning curve but I&#x27;m looking forward to learning how to blow dry and straighten my hair at the same time without the hassle of having to hold the dryer and a round brush simultaneously.</li>
    <li> Best Blow dryer to control thick unruly hair</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer - this is my third one - but they have shorten the cord on it - really need a longer cord.</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair... Leaves it soft n straight in less time.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer, idk how it works on dripping wet hair, but it dries my semi dried hair in about 2-3 strokes on low. I am very pleased by this blow dryer &amp; would suggest it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Only used it on e but I gotta say its awesome.....&lt;br /&gt;I was never good with the dryer and the brush combination....&lt;br /&gt;It does look big and weird but you get used to it...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget the cool shot button :)&lt;br /&gt;and the flat iron if you want a more flat style...</li>
    <li> My daughter has long thick 4b hair and I used this blowdryer and it dried so FAST...I was shocked.  It detangled perfectly and I only heard OUCH once from my daughter and that is amazing.  There was minimal amount of hair in the dryer when I was done.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone with natural hair.</li>
    <li> Great for my natural hair. Easy to use</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my coniar 3 in 1 dryer! The best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used or purchased!</li>
    <li> In love with this blow dryer....I would recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> This tool makes it a lot easier to achieve a blowout than using a blow dryer and a brush simultaneously. It straighten my natural hair nicely and gave it great shine, which I loved. My best blowout yet! Now I might straighten my hair more often. It does take getting some used to, meaning getting the blow dryer in the right angle. Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Ive had the older model of this for many years until recently it began falling apart.  I couldnt find any other blow dryer with an extention like this.  This new model is powerful and hot and dries quickly,  but i dont like how thry changed the parts on the extention.  It makes it difficult to get my thick hair through the brush parts.</li>
    <li> works well, I have fine wavy to curly hair, takes about 15 minutes to dry from damp. Sometimes I make it perfect with a round dryer or a flat iron, but day to day I can just do this dryer. It lasts for days and a round dryer is good for touch ups.</li>
    <li> This is second time purchasing this item. Still love it. Disappointed that the electric cord is shorter.</li>
    <li> I have and love the wine color of this blower and decide to buy the purple color. It&#x27;s works exactly like the wine color and blows my hair straight and eliminates the use of the round hair brush. Works much then the regular blow dryers.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, naturally wavy, shoulder length hair. It normally takes me about 15 min to dry my hair and another 15 to straighten it with a flat iron. This thing is amazing! I timed myself before i used this with my normal routine (about 30 min total - ugh). i timed myself using this for the first time and it only took 16 min! i did NOT need to use my flat iron. I can see that I may want to use a flat iron for absolute perfection but it would only take 5 min tops, probably more like 3. This hair dryer straightened and dried my hair in one shot. I followed the directions and sectioned my hair a little - just 3 sections, bottom, then middle, then the top. I thought it would be cumbersome to use but it is really easy. The crazy comb/straightener part can be easily moved at about 8 different angles which was helpful, it can also be taken off entirely to use as a regular hair drier. I didn&#x27;t do that. I think as i get used to this it will take even less time to dry and straighten my hair. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> It really does cut my straightening time in half! It works really well! One of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Great dryer. Straightens natural curly hair pretty well, and dries hair quickly. My 16 year old uses it on her hair with no problems.</li>
    <li> Where have you been my whole life?!! A natural hair blogger I follow, used the Infiniti Pro in one of her videos, &amp; I became a believer!  I have 4A-C natural hair, &amp; after using it, I was more impressed. I have extremely, extremely thick hair, and the time I spent drying my hair was the quickest time I&#x27;ve spent drying my hair w/ other dryers. This is like gold to my thick, 4C hair!</li>
    <li> Could be better if the comb teeth were longer, but overall it works.</li>
    <li> AMAZING HAIR DRYER!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say I love it! I have curly hair and to get it straight I used to spend 1hr or sometimes more. I would blow dry my hair and then used the flat iron, but with the Infiniti Pro it takes me 40 min approx and I do not need to use the flat iron, I love how my hair looks just using the Infiniti Pro!</li>
    <li> Great purchase! It is light weight compared to my standard dryer and easy to manage. It works very well for thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I like it. I have type 4c hair and it gets my hair straighter than normal blowdryers. Make sure you start off will smaller sections and take your time!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! Received on time and I can&#x27;t stop bragging about how GOOD it is to my natural hair ;-)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, dries your hair super quick and I don&#x27;t use straighteners to straighten after. I love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived with a USA plug, shame as you can only use in the USA unless you purchase a transformer which I was not willing to pay for. Sent it backZ,</li>
    <li> The Infinity Pro by Conair dries my hair really fast and I love the size of this appliance and the way the attachment are secure on the unit and does flip or snap off. I have 4C coarse hair and this dryer is a plus for me. The oiler brush on it Is suppose to make the hair shine, I don&#x27;t see it for my hair so that is why I gave it only 4 stars. But it is a must buy for quick straight  dry hair.</li>
    <li> Works very good. I love it.</li>
