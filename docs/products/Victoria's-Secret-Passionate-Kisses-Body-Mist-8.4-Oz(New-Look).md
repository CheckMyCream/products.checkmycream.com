    <li> LOVE THIS SCENT! And I cannot find it anywhere but here &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> this smells really good!!! I can&#x27;t find it in any of the victoria&#x27;s secret stores. so when i saw it online, i just went for it. this product is recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s real scent</li>
    <li> When I first received this mist, I was extremely excited to smell it! Sprayed once, I was engulfed in a medicine like smell. Eeek! Tried it again, it started smelling like cherry lollipops! I think I like the smell after spraying it, if it even makes sense. Downside of this product is that, I can&#x27;t smell it after some time. Sucks!</li>
    <li> this has to be one of my FAVORITE scents! SOOOo yummy smelling. Reminds me of fruit punch or something really juicy and yummy. Awesome! Yummy! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Yes the item looked just like it did in the pic ;)</li>
    <li> Great accessory to the lotion I bought. I loved it and will shop again. Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Scent not original.  Definitely fake and packaging showed that.</li>
    <li> When I went into Victoria Secerts they had no idea what I was talking about. Gald Amazon knows what&#x27;s up:)</li>
    <li> Smells like kool-Aid to me, but it was a good deal. Although I&#x27;m not into fruity/punch smells I gave it away to one of my sisters she liked, bottle is fully gone will buy more but different scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  It smells really watered down.</li>

    <li> I love this fragrance, and have previously been able to purchase it from The Victoria&#x27;s Secret store during their semi-annual sales, and only during these sales (they do not offer this scent any other time of the year). However, during the last SA sales, it wasn&#x27;t there!!!  Thank you Amazon for allowing me to continue smelling awesome!</li>
