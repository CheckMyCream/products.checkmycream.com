<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have several of Edens Gardens oils and am satisfied with all.  I wanted to see what Frankincense and Myrrh smell like from having heard Bible stories about it my whole life.  I really like the scent of the Frankincense, but I think Myrrh will be something I will have to work toward liking.  I will use it in some recipes I have for medicinal purposes, but it smells like swamp to me.  :)</li>
    <li> I needed a bigger bottle. I use it for my joint pain. Very cooling.</li>
    <li> familiar fragrance...nice and warm...spicy...reminds me of something...</li>
    <li> I received my order and love this product. I&#x27;ve purchased several oils from this company and have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> If you want concentrated, genuine stuff, this is it! Arrived intact and very quickly. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Stronger than I had hoped. I guess that makes it great quality. Edens Garden is my fav EO supplier thus far, and I purchased from a lot of different ones.</li>
    <li> this is a very pure oil i do not use it as much as frankenscence but it does work well on gums in mouth and on chapped skin a little goes a long way everything was what the company promised</li>
    <li> more good buys from edens garden</li>
    <li> This was purchased as gifts for my sister&#x27;s for the holiday.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Eden Garden oils are awesome!  I love the informational booklet that came with the oil.  It outlines all of the EO&#x27;s that they sell and common and uncommon uses.</li>
    <li> Nice oils, nice price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting, and fast delivery, too! Strong essential oils, great for cosmetic and medicinal use.  I&#x27;ll purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Not so impressed with this scent</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> found there are a lot of products on the market today that are lesser quality for higher price, was pleasantly surprised with the quality and scent of the oil.</li>
    <li> Fast service as always.  There was a problem with the dropper but the product was fine.</li>
    <li> Awesome products! Best delivery ever!</li>
    <li> Works very good, but it smells kinda yuck. But not the company fault it&#x27;s just the way myrrh smells. But edens garden is as good if not better than doterra. Love everything I have gotten from them. Over 10 oils!</li>
    <li> I really am impressed with all of Edens Garden EO. They work great for me.</li>
    <li> I was sceptcal about buying this at first because of its low price. I was very pleased with the results! It was pure grade as they said. It smells strong like it should. It works great with everything that I use it for. It arrived very quickly and was packaged very well. I will buy from them again!</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Great quality!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Marla-Buchanan/e/B00JVBLL66</li>
    <li> The caption says it all. Very pleased with the product, it contains only 5ml, so keep that in mind. Carefully wrapped &amp; fast delivery. I will order this product again from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Its working wonderfully. Just as well as another very reputable brand I use but pay...sooooo much more for. I&#x27;ve ordered several Edens Garden oil...all for medicinal use and all are working just as they should...I&#x27;m running low on a few and getting ready to reorder those and more. ♥...great quality.</li>
    <li> Have used on muscle spasm and bruises. just great, but even better with frankincense.&lt;br /&gt;Great on  small cuts as a first aid.</li>
    <li> Making my own cosmetics and lotions and this is essential to any firming lotion recipe.  Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Very good and efficient</li>
    <li> The essential oil seems to be fine and I enjoy it. The problem is that it seems to be somehow leaking down the neck of the bottle which makes the bottle-neck and the inside of the cap messy and very difficult to use - open/close. I cleaned both parts with alcohol several times already but the dried-on mess keeps appearing persistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the problem might be because I have never experienced anything like that with another essential oil. Might be that the plastic dropper part doesn&#x27;t seal the bottle properly or it&#x27;s damaged.</li>
    <li> I love myrr as all essential oils. Good price, quality oil and the uses are varied according to needs. Think Xmas</li>
    <li> I was drawn in to essential oils via my introduction to frankincense. I thought, hey if the wise men traveled hundreds of miles to bring 3 gifts to Jesus, and one was Frankincense and one was Myrrh, they must be pretty special. I gave four stars to this product probably partially because  poor &amp;#34;myrrh&amp;#34; came a day after my NOW Frankincense. The amazing, lovely calming smell of frankincense had me thinking the myrrh would smell equally divine, but it actually has a very understated aroma, and no where near as much &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34;. I still would recommend it and enjoy using the EG myrrh (which has different purposes), but its aroma nowhere near compares to the frankincense.</li>
    <li> I bought his brand of myrrh because I&#x27;m familiar with some of their other Essential Oils. They are HIGH QUALITY, (based on my research!). The benefits of myrrh are too lengthy to list here, but you can do your own research for that! I can only say that from my own research, this brand is superb!</li>
    <li> Love these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> Completes my variety of essencial oils.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It came well packaged and within the specified number of days. It came with instructions and description of the product. It is as described. Good product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great to add to my collection of essential oils.  Myrrh 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 5 ml  Edens Garden Loving it!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought Myrrh oil because I have COPD early stages and in my support group they said put it on side of nose and upper lip, which I did.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t done anything yet but many sware by it.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Myrrh (Commipihora myrrha) has a rich, smoky, balsamic aroma that is purifying, restorative, revitalizing, and uplifting. It is a helpful aid to meditation, having one of the highest levels of sesquiterpenes available. Sesquiterpenes are a class of compounds that have a direct effect on the hypothalamus, pituitary, and amygdala, the seat of our emotions. Myrrh is referenced throughout the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The Arabian people believed it helped wrinkled, chapped, and cracked skin</li>
    <li> Oil quality is good and scent is nice. I would not hesitate to order again. This oil has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great oil! Arrive fast!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant, blends well enough great to relax or meander about with.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the more earth ones are bitter smelling, this is almost sweet but also warming and bold strong, but not sharp, soothing but also heavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the essential oil. I will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Quality is great. Fabulous product for a great price</li>
    <li> I have use a lot of oils and these are some of the best. I love the real smells that they should be putting out.</li>
    <li> Thank you Edens Garden for providing a great product for a great value! Love this myrrh essential oil! I use it for skin care, and healing!</li>
    <li> I have bought several Edens Garden essential oils and they do not disappoint! They have a great strong smell and work great in a burner to make the whole house smell good. Or I use them for body spray and hair therapy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this oil and would buy more.  I was glad I was able to find it on Amazon.  Will explore other oils to try as well.</li>
    <li> As described -Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> It would be nice if it came (on the bottle) with more details (CT, expiry, origin, etc.). However I liked it.</li>
    <li> I annoint my feet in this, especially where I have had trouble and I swear, I have never felt better</li>
    <li> Great oil at a great price. I have never been let down by an Edens Garden product and this was no exception. It smells as it should and seems very potent. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great oil once you get use to the smell of myrrh. I mix it with frankincense and aloe vera gel to use on my face. I had dark circles really bad under my eyes and they are fading fast!!!</li>
    <li> Good on my dogs skin allergies mixed with tree tree, thieves, cypress, lavender and 4 oz. distilled water</li>
    <li> I love this brand of essential oils.</li>
    <li> The name sounds so earthy, and the scent is even earthier, It smells like being  under 10 feet of rainforest soil, but it smells very good. nothing herbally or botanic, just deep dark earthy.</li>
    <li> I think it has helped heal mouth sores but I have found that I have an allergic re-action to it, so I use very little.. Even though it is a small bottle I am sure it will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> I need to order more!</li>
    <li> This is just one of many oils that I&#x27;ve purchased from Edens Garden.  I use Myrrh on face and neck every day.</li>
    <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden is the best company that I have found to purchase essential oils. They are very strong and high quality.</li>
    <li> Good price and a great oil.  I am so glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the lid get stuck on, the oil dry on the top and makes it hard to get off!</li>
    <li> My anointed oil, cant say enough of this healing oil.&lt;br /&gt;It smells,but does the job.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil. It is a part of my thyroid protocol. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> has not done&lt;br /&gt; anything</li>
    <li> I know understand the value of this oil as a gift for the Baby Jesus. In those days it an essential way of relieving pain.</li>
    <li> This cured all the pains in my body. This is highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have about 20 or more different oils from this company.  The myrrh from this company I found was the cheapest to buy from.  I enjoy the smell.  I have frankincense as well, so I now know what these oils smelled like laid at the feet of Jesus.  That was really what I bought it for.  The only thing I don&#x27;t have now, is the gold.  :)</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> The quality of this oil is very good.  Great medicinal oil.</li>
    <li> the oil works for joint inflammation but it dries around the bottle like glue and makes the cap very difficult to open&lt;br /&gt;also the smell is very strong and unpleasant 5o me&lt;br /&gt;i will buy the oil again but i will research other companies looking for better odor and bottle accessibility</li>
    <li> very well I definitely wanted because since I saw you I feel like my aches a going away</li>
    <li> I bought Myrrh also,Frankincense, to use for circulatory purposes, also because of the many other special things it can be used for. Myrrh being one of the spiritual gifts, as it says in the Bible; meant a lot for me to just have some.The smell is unique in it&#x27;s own way.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. I use it in making soap and add to mineral oil to soothe dry skin in winter. It also works in an oil warmer. I use a small crock pot with water and a few drops floating on top.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great ship time.</li>
    <li> Spectacular natural remedy for body and mind.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 of the Edens Garden essential oils,.  All 5 smelled the same, like they were old and stale.  I would not but them again!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my crock pot type of oil burner.  Smells great. I also out some on a bottom ball and out it in my vacuum cleaner bag to get rid of the sour smells it accumulates</li>
    <li> Must&#x27;ve been a bad batch. Smells like cheap rubber.</li>
    <li> I do not know what i expected with this exactly - i know in the Book of Esther the young candidates for queen soaked in (among other things) myrrh for six months - but myrrh is VERY STINKY and i&#x27;m wondering how they made that work exactly.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz recommended myrrh essential oil as a mouth rinse.  Although the fragrance is mellow, a few drops in water as a mouth rinse is fairly strong, but if its use improves the gums, it&#x27;s not too objectionable is used at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Lovely, just absolutely fantastic scent.  I am so happy with this purchase, and I definitely recommend giving this oil a try.</li>
    <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden because their quality is superior to any other oil I have used. I only trust Eden&#x27;s garden now and I have been extremely pleased with every order placed through them.</li>
    <li> Great service product as described</li>
    <li> I have never use this, I am Looking forward to using this Product  for Therapeutic pain relief. found this online.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Smells bad, but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, and great product!</li>
    <li> This is another oil that I have used more than expected. Great addition to many products - especially around the holidays.</li>
    <li> good scent , good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this type of oil for a ton more money elsewhere so I decided to try this one. I like it.</li>
    <li> Love all your oils.  I have been stocking up</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery! Very little bottle but I don&#x27;t need very much ! So that woks!</li>
    <li> I never go without it .</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.  These are oils are exactly the same as the oils that people are paying big bucks for from young living at a fraction of the cost!!  Also their customer service is exceptional!!</li>
    <li> ok now I will need to keep some of this stuff on hand all the time.. good for just about anything that ails you..</li>
    <li> Good price &amp; service.</li>
    <li> Very good service. Smell ok.</li>
    <li> All I can say about this is that is reminds me of Christmas time! It kind of has a musky scent to it which I like. I actually use it while I&#x27;m meditating and it calms me.</li>
    <li> I like the price of the eadens garden aromatherapies. I know the young living oils can be taken internally.&lt;br /&gt; I cannot tell if these can be though.</li>
    <li> As always, prompt service in additional to quality oils and merchandise. I repeat, this is my new essential oil store! A+++++++</li>
    <li> For those who have never smelled myrrh, it has a somewhat masculine property. I used it to make Christmas soaps, but foolishly, I ordered it without knowing what it actually smelled like (I just really liked the notion of making Frankincense and Myrrh soaps for Christmas).  However, if you already know you like this scent (which I would describe as dark and perhaps a touch musky), then I would say go for it.  I absolutely love Edens Garden.  The quality is always high, the price is fair, the size is just right, and they have a wide selection of essential oils.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly! Soothing and skin feels like silk. Use it all over. My husband likes it too. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Strong scent, works wonderfully in the bath or added to spa products. Packaging is secure and looks nice in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have not been using Pure oils very long.  this brand was recommended by my daughter who has used Eden Oils.  Good competitive prices.  quick delivery, wrapped well.</li>
    <li> I have made some ointments using this essential oils&lt;br /&gt;its fresh and I will certainly recommend the brand to&lt;br /&gt;whoever asks me for a recommendation.</li>
    <li> I will buy from edens garden again</li>
    <li> I liked the oils very much</li>
    <li> This Myrrh oil, doesn&#x27;t really have a strong scent. I used it in my vaporizer and I can hardly even smell anything. this is really not what I was looking for. If your looking for the myrrh scent.. this doesn&#x27;t really help at all. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake ordering this.  I really wanted tincture of Myrrh!</li>
    <li> Love these oils great for scares and much more.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Myrrh. I use this as a semi-cologne.</li>
    <li> Great size! Great Price and thank you for the book!!!!!</li>
    <li> Need more time to make an ivaluation</li>
    <li> Just what needed. Good seller.</li>
    <li> Superb essential oil.  Use in homemade deodorant and skincare.  Fabulous!</li>
    <li> Awesome product very satisfied</li>
    <li> I have only used this in diffuser,  It smelled wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I love all of Edens Garden&#x27;s essential oils!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! High quality. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I like therapeutic oils and I love patchouli, frankincense and thought that I would like myrrh but smells like a older rubber tire....the quality is good but i use some drops In my bath tub and smell is important on my relaxing time......shipping was quick and safely packaged.....</li>
    <li> WOW- Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell. I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet... awesome! I recommend this company and their products!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and a fair price</li>
    <li> Wonderful, deep, soothing smell and more than I expected in that klittle vial.</li>
    <li> I think this was a great price for an amazing essential oil. I love Eden&#x27;s Garden. They have great products and great prices and they always arrive in a very timely manner. I highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden, and will continue to buy from them.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell good.  Probably was taken from the bark not the gum. It has a wooden smell and not pleasant one.  I had the hope it gonna smell good as the myrrh incence but i was wrong.</li>
    <li> Therapeutic Grade! Do I need to say any more</li>
