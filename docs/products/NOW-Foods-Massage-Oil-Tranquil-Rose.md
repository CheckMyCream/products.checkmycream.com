      <li>It lingers on your skin even after hours of application, which I also love.</li>

      <li>that is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
      <li>Now Foods makes some really nice oils at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I have been using this massage oil for the last week - as a moisturizer :) I love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is absorbed into the skin very quick and does not transfer onto the clothes -</li>
      <li>Ordering another bottle to have for the full fall winter season.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and greasy like some massage oils can be, and absorbs nicely into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell, very relaxing</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this oil, but it is much stickier than I prefer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using it at home on my skin after the shower because I love the consistency and the scent so much.</li>
      <li>And let me tell you.. not only do I smell even more delicious, it leaves me SO soft, and makes the shave last even longer.</li>
      <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel without leaving a sticky oily residue.  </li>
      <li>i got to put a smile on her face and on mine</li>
      <li>I whipped one quarter cup of pure shea butter with one teaspoon of this massager oil, and wa-la!</li>
      <li>Comment later when I get to use it more.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, absorbs nicely into the skin, and you are left with a subtle hint of sweet oranges.  </li>
      <li>AND IT DON&#x27;T TAKE MUCH</li>
      <li>And it really does smell like that.</li>
      <li>I find the scent is more vanilla than orange but both compliment each other and make this very helpful to massage hurt/tired muscles.</li>
      <li>It is so silky smooth, and I have found a liking to use this after shaving my lady parts (Obviously not near inside</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to strong odors, so I am very careful with my purchases of scented items.</li>
      <li>This smell is very natural and not over powering.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s also male approved on my end ;)</li>
      <li>is more economical too since only a few drops of oil are needed to moisturize one&#x27;s skin vs the multiple pumps of a body</li>
      <li>It completely smells like a vanilla/orange creamesicle.</li>
      <li>My clients prefer them to some of the more expensive professional products because of their natural simplicity.</li>
      <li>i do like that the ingredients list is short and natural- various oils and vitamin E from soy.</li>
      <li>I hate heavily perfumed products, and this has a wonderful natural scent.</li>

<li> I knew it might be from reading other reviews</li>
<li> It smells of both vanilla and orange, a delicate sweet smell that lingers faintly on the skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> so it does tend to run down the bottle</li>
<li> If I mention it they notice it, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that I can use it without expecting a comment either way too.</li>
<li> Have not had any trouble with it staining linens or clothing.</li>
<li> Why waste money on tyoxic garbage at beaut stores when you can use ingredients from mother nature?</li>
<li> Slow shipping.</li>
<li> but you get what I mean!)</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thin</li>
<li> Give it 1 star for sending wrong scent.  </li>
<li> so I wasn&#x27;t shocked.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Needed some oil and didn&#x27;t know which one to choose...finally decided on this one because orange creamsicle scented massage oil intrigued me. And it really does smell like that. Its not as overpowering as some of said, just a soft smell which is pleasant though you may want to make sure your client or partner is ok with the smell...i do like that the ingredients list is short and natural- various oils and vitamin E from soy.</li>
    <li> Smells great and hydrates well</li>
    <li> I love this oil, and use it as a moisturizer on my legs and arms. I hate heavily perfumed products, and this has a wonderful natural scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff it nice and smooth with a plesent oder..my girl and i gave each other a rub and it did the trick..i got to put a smile on her face and on mine</li>
    <li> Give it 5 stars for usability.  Give it 1 star for sending wrong scent.  Average of 3 stars - totally fault of NOW Foods, not Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to strong odors, so I am very careful with my purchases of scented items. This smell is very natural and not over powering. A little also goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo great!  I use it for everything to do with skin and hair and the scent stay with you all day.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this oil, but it is much stickier than I prefer.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, vibrant, and soothing oil, it moisturizes the skin to a perfect consistency therefore enabling a perfect massage any time!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, very relaxing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used massage oil before, just lotion, but it was wonderful. It was &#x27;slipery&#x27; enough to not cause any friction, but didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. The smell is very nice, although it was more orange smelling than I was hoping for. I knew it might be from reading other reviews so I wasn&#x27;t shocked. I&#x27;ve only used it once two days ago so it&#x27;s a little early to tell if it would cause any breakouts. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it. Never going back to massaging with lotion.</li>
    <li> This smells great!  I used it to make an amazing body lotion.  I whipped one quarter cup of pure shea butter with one teaspoon of this massager oil, and wa-la! An instant, luxurious body butter.  It goes on smooth, absorbs nicely into the skin, and you are left with a subtle hint of sweet oranges.  Why waste money on tyoxic garbage at beaut stores when you can use ingredients from mother nature?</li>
    <li> I like the smell and how it makes my skin feel.  The vanilla does overpower the citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Now Foods makes some really nice oils at a reasonable price. My clients prefer them to some of the more expensive professional products because of their natural simplicity. The orange-vanilla oil is a perfect massage texture and smells mildly like a dreamsicle. If I mention it they notice it, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that I can use it without expecting a comment either way too. I&#x27;ve started using it at home on my skin after the shower because I love the consistency and the scent so much.</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed by this oil. There is so much good to this oil, I don&#x27;t even know where to start. The smell..it smells HEAVENLY. It completely smells like a vanilla/orange creamesicle. It is very strong in the scent, which I like. It lingers on your skin even after hours of application, which I also love. It is so silky smooth, and I have found a liking to use this after shaving my lady parts (Obviously not near inside but you get what I mean!) And let me tell you.. not only do I smell even more delicious, it leaves me SO soft, and makes the shave last even longer. I use it on my feet as well and my fiance&#x27; can&#x27;t get enough of it. So it&#x27;s also male approved on my end ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and I plan on buying more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great, sealed and brand new.</li>

    <li> Really enjoy this oil to use on my clients,  great scent and easy use within my techniques .  Adds a little extra when needed toward my long strokes with my coconut oil,  especially when using on men and body hair.  Bought this before and will again</li>
    <li> This oil is very strongly vanilla and orange scented. I find the scent is more vanilla than orange but both compliment each other and make this very helpful to massage hurt/tired muscles. I definitely recommend this as a relaxing massage oil.</li>
    <li> A wonderful massage oil with a delicious light scent.  It is not heavy and greasy like some massage oils can be, and absorbs nicely into the skin.  Have not had any trouble with it staining linens or clothing.</li>
    <li> We love this massage oil, it has a nice orange creamsicle scent (not too strong), and the pop top bottle makes using it fast and easy. It&#x27;s thin so it does tend to run down the bottle so we he a coaster to set it on. A little goes a long way. Finally, it&#x27;s a fair price for the quality.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves the skin soft, and lubricates for massage very easily.</li>
    <li> Smells great, my daughter ended up stealing it from me:)</li>
    <li> Slow shipping. Took about two weeks that I almost forgot it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very lubricating as for massage oil. Comment later when I get to use it more.</li>
    <li> This smells so delicious!  Like a vanilla orange cake which is my favorite homemade desert.  I love how soft it makes my skin feel without leaving a sticky oily residue.  Ordering another bottle to have for the full fall winter season.</li>
