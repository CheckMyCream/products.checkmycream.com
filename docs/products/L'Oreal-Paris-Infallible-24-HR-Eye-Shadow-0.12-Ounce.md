      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>My sisters and mom loved it</li>
      <li>so if L&#x27;Oreal isn&#x27;t good for you, try Maybelline.</li>

      <li>if the price is greater than $7, go buy at the nearest drugstore or walmart.  </li>

      <li>Stays put most of the day.</li>
      <li>I love this eye shadow.</li>
      <li>I use it more in Summer and as an enhancer just over the eyelashes when i wear the Smoldering Plum.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice colour. not blendable but good for lid</li>
    <li> Nice color...more coppery than it appears in the picture. Difficult to apply evenly. It&#x27;s kind of pressed and kind of loose. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to apply it smoothly and evenly. Oh, and it was shipped in a ridiculously huge and wasteful box.</li>
    <li> only eyeshadow I have found that will stay on all day!!! ladies its a must have!</li>
    <li> This product is not really easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use for awhile at first, because it looks so dark, and I am so pale.  But I tried it.  It&#x27;s beautiful.  Goes on smoothly, stays on well.  Nice color.  (I wear it over a Jordana eye primer.)</li>
    <li> Read on pinterest this eye shadow compliments any color eyes. It is one of my favorites and stays on for hours.</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with creasing, even with primers. This stuff is the only eyeshadow I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t do that! It&#x27;s fantastic. Highly pigmented, and lasts all day. I have every color, and love them all!</li>
    <li> This color is very close to my natural eyelid color with the sparkle added. I use it more in Summer and as an enhancer just over the eyelashes when i wear the Smoldering Plum. It goes on easily and really draws attention to the eyes.</li>
    <li> Such a great all over shadow. I use it by itself and it&#x27;s great.  Stays on long and is not too much makeup. I like to use it for summer days or when I want more of a light fresh look.</li>
    <li> Love it,beautiful shade,very pigmented lasts all day even without a primer.I will be ordering more of these in different shades.</li>
    <li> Loving the colors, awesome</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! Looks awesome for people who have blue eyes. I would buy from this seller again. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> OMG these eye shadows are AMAZING and this color is beautiful. It lasts all day and is very pigmented. Love it!</li>
    <li> I saw this color on Pinterest and I was leary of buying it because I have never bought this brand. However I am amazed at this product. It lasts all day and it does have a shimmer to it but it truly does make your eyes look less tired. It is my go to color now. With a dark brown liner you can really make a great smokey eye.</li>
    <li> I love these eye shadows sooo much. Great color pigment, go on easy and stay on all day/night. I bought these for work for that reason. I&#x27;m an RN, so this stuff stays on through all my running around, sweat, face shields, all that. I was planning on just designating these as only work makeup but I find myself wearing them basically all the time. This color in particular I was expecting to be a bit prettier. It&#x27;s dark than I thought, more gold/copper. I thought it&#x27;s be light or be a bit more pink. My eyes are green/blue and I thought this color would do more for me. Still pretty.</li>
    <li> Buttery, creamy, whatever you want to describe it as, it&#x27;s simply wonderful. L&#x27;Oreal bought Urban Decay a couple of years back, so they might&#x27;ve stolen a few of their amazing eyeshadow secrets, because these drugstore shadows are absolutely comparable to UD shadows that are double the price.</li>
    <li> This has the perfect shimmer and doesn&#x27;t get all over your face. Makes my blue eyes pop!</li>
    <li> Amber Rush is a beautiful eyeshadow by L&#x27;oreal. Their Infallible Eyeshadows are a great dupe for the Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill. I wasn&#x27;t planning on writing a review-- but there was a problem with my shipment, which is what I want to talk about. Nawn Captain (seller) has EXCELLENT reviews, and it&#x27;s no surprise why. USPS messed up my order (not her), and so I contacted her. I am utterly impressed with how kind she was and how quickly she responded. Not only did she apologize (even though it wasn&#x27;t her fault), she also sent me an extra gift (Loreal eyeshadows). I thanked you via e-mail, but I would like to thank you again, Shawna. And to all of you readers, I&#x27;m telling you-- Nawn Captain is an excellent and trustworthy company to buy from, which is refreshing to know since there are many companies out there who lack great customer service. 5 big, big stars!&lt;br /&gt;-Patricia</li>
    <li> Amber Rush is an amazing dynamic color. I often just wear it by itself because it&#x27;s so shimmery the light will hit it differently on your crease and lid so it&#x27;s doing twice as much work that I don&#x27;t really need any other shade. That could vary with eye shapes though. Youtube it to get better ideas.</li>
    <li> I gave this item 2 stars because the color is amazing and it stays on my eyes nicely.  Problem is that it gets ALL OVER MY FACE when applying it and afterwards.  So much so that I avoid using it. I expected more from L&#x27;Oreal considering that cosmetics are their business.  It doesn&#x27;t take a scientist to know that eyeshadow should not crumble onto the face.</li>
    <li> Love this color to highlight eyes in daytime! Very attractive and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> The colour and colour payoff on this is lovely, and it works quite spectacularly as a shimmery lid shade. It&#x27;s very pretty and long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colour makes your eyes look more blue</li>
    <li> This product caused a serious allergic reaction! I don&#x27;t have allergies, so it took me quite by surprise when I broke out in hives and my face swelled up. Even though it started the day after trying this the first time, my doctor initially didn&#x27;t think eyeshadow could be the cause since it was so severe, so I tried the eyeshadow one more time and had the same exact thing happen. I&#x27;m on day 13 and finally seem to really be improving but am still quite uncomfortable all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the packaging any longer so I looked up ingredients on their website. Unfortunately they list the ingredients of every shade of Infallible eyeshadow together so I e-mailed customer service to get a list of just the Amber Rush ingredients and will start comparing ingredients to my other products I don&#x27;t react to until I find the culprit. Unfortunately I bought this item in stores and L&#x27;Oreal does not package this product in any sort of tamper-resistant packaging, so I have to consider the possibility that someone tampered with it in stores as well. In any case, 2 weeks of misery is not worth anything and I&#x27;m staying away from anything L&#x27;Oreal until I figure it out!</li>
    <li> Not the right color for me but it&#x27;s pretty that&#x27;s for sure</li>
    <li> My favorite shade of eye shadow. It looks so good on</li>
    <li> wonderful texture and color.  Compliments blue eyes beautifully.  Stays put most of the day. A great bargain for the money!</li>
    <li> So this eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t last very long on me. I would say I&#x27;ve got oily eyelids and this eyeshadow is creasing and wearing off about 2 hrs after application. The colors are nice but like I said, I only experience awesome looking eyes for 2 hrs, LOL! I switched to Maybellines cream eyeshadow and those stay on a lot longer so if L&#x27;Oreal isn&#x27;t good for you, try Maybelline.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow rocks beyond belief! Its extremely pigmented, smooth, opaque, and SO BEAUTIFUL on the lids!!! I seriously want the whole line, I am obsessed with these eye shadows!</li>
    <li> Pretty.  Looks nice.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I own several colors from the Infallible line and this is now my new favorite.  The color is a gorgeous rose gold with a hint of copper.  It goes on easily and really does last.  Though highly pigmented, it can be worn as a semi-sheer color or built up to a more intense color.  To change it up a bit it also looks amazing lightly layered over pink, purple or green.&lt;br /&gt;The color has sparkle to it without being over the top gilttery so it looks good either day or night.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as a highlighter on the tops of my cheeks as well as inner tear duct.</li>
    <li> This is now my go to color, I absolutely LOVE it! It works perfectly for an everyday look and can be played up for an evening look as well.</li>
    <li> So nice! Beautiful color, texture, gentle with eyes... very NICE</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Great pigmentation, staying power and no fall-out, since these are loose pigments, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of. Basically, everything a good eyeshadow should be.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased this product because it was affordable and seemed to be what I was looking for. I had originally wanted to purchase Stila&#x27;s foil eyeshadow but it was $32 on amazon! Much more that I would ever want to spend on such a tiny container of eyeshadow. It was hard to tell from the picture on Amazon how shiny this shadow was but I was very very pleased when it finally arrived. This shadow gives eyelids a gorgeous shine/sparkle without being too overbearing. The color Amber Rush is a very classy color great for any formal occasion because it shines just enough to grab peoples attention, without looking like clown colors. You really don&#x27;t need to apply too much of this shadow to get the desired color so I am hoping this will last me a while. So I would have to say that this shadow is just as grand as the Stila&#x27;s foil eyeshadow, but for a much cheaper price. I can&#x27;t wait to try out L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other eyeshadow colors from this collection!</li>
    <li> Love the color and stays even all day!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow. It&#x27;s the only kind I ever want to use again!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Really like this soft shade for day wear.  I also love it because it takes the abuse of a hot, humid climate.  It stays fresh and vibrant, and truly lives up to its name of &amp;#34;Infallible&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t be afraid to give it a try!</li>
    <li> Definitely one of my favourites in the Infallible eyeshadow series! A perfect match for grey-green eyes. You don&#x27;t need a eyelid primer, it will last all day without migrating. I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! This stuff is the best eyeshadow for the price! Compares to all the expensive brands so why pay more?!</li>
    <li> One of the best out there. Shimmery without being glittery. Last all day!</li>
    <li> Pretty color but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> The negative reviews this product is getting are unfounded. I have every color that this amazing eye shadow comes in &amp; it&#x27;s one of my all time favorites. First, it&#x27;s a pressed mineral shadow. When you open the jar, there&#x27;s a gray \\&quot;stopper\\&quot; that presses the shadow down in between uses. You need very little on your brush because it&#x27;s so pigmented otherwise you will have fallout, but it&#x27;s easily wisped away with a fan brush. These shadows last a long time, I can put it on at 8 am &amp; it still looks beautiful at 8 pm! I suggest using an eye primer or base to really hold on to the color. These are on par with high end eye shadows &amp; worth every penny. I highly recommend them, Amber Rush is a beautiful golden bronze shade!</li>
    <li> First time purchasing this product and I love this color and the product!  I would definitely buy this brand, this color, and other colors again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful foiled/metallic color. Perfect for summer. The ONLY thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about is I have to wet my brush before i apply otherwise it falls everywhere. Great product though.</li>
    <li> Nice color, not great packaging.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is just everything gorgeous, the color is very pigmented so a little bit goes a long way. What makes this color so interesting is when the light hits it you get a glimpse bronze, gold, and silver all in one glimpse. This shadow will probably last me for the next 8 years.</li>
    <li> I love the formula of these eye shadows, Amber Rush and Endless Pearl in particular are my new HG everyday colors. It did take a little playing to find what the best way for me to wear these eye shadows. They are more like pressed pigments than traditional eye shadows. I found that to avoid fallout using a damp flat shader brush to push the color onto the lid is great. I then use a fluffier brush to blend out the color. The shimmer is iridescent and pretty and you can sheer it to almost nothing or layer it to create an intense, almost metallic finish.</li>
    <li> Love this so much! 5 stars!!! Like slot of people I saw this in a Jaclyn hill YouTube makeup tutorial and had to have it. It&#x27;s gorgeous. Makes my eyes pop like crazy. Everyone needs this shadow in their collection</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Looks great all by itself or in combination with other colors.</li>
    <li> The color of this eyeshadow is beautiful, and the pigmentation is seriously SUPERB.  this might be the best drugstore eyeshadow out there, as far as i know it even beats many department store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-beautiful rose-gold color&lt;br /&gt;-nice packaging- can see the color&lt;br /&gt;-buttery texture&lt;br /&gt;-totally rad pigmentation (I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH)&lt;br /&gt;-cheap considering the high quality&lt;br /&gt;-color is flattering on most people&lt;br /&gt;-no weird smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-if you accidentally throw out the plastic plunger thing inside the eyeshadow will get everywhere!!&lt;br /&gt;-no brush included, but fingers are preferred by many people as a means of application anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict-&lt;br /&gt;oh my god this is literally the best eyeshadow i have ever bough from a drugstore.  if the price is greater than $7, go buy at the nearest drugstore or walmart.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  the other colors, although i do not have them, are also stunningly beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.  i used elf eyelid primer with this and it stayed on forever!</li>
    <li> beautiful color, so creamy</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is insanely pigmented and shimmery! It&#x27;s also very beautiful, it has no smell and goes on smoothly. Must have!</li>
    <li> Beautiful eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Eye shadow never stays put on my lids, however this one does.  It goes on very smooth, and stays put all day.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, buttery consistency and beautiful color. Stays on long too - is a great dupe for Too Faced Push-Up but you get way more for your money. I never trust drug-store brand eyeshadows but this is the best I&#x27;ve used and works/looks even better than most of the pricey upscale brands. Had to write a review because I love good makeup finds without the steep price tag :)</li>
    <li> This is a really good eyeshadow for people who like neutrals. It&#x27;s shimmery, not too glittery but may not be appropriate for work.</li>
    <li> I have never met anyone with oilier skin than mine and this stays put all day with or without primer. I press it on with my finger rather than a brush for heavier coverage and if I want to intensify the color I layer it over a primer or cream shadow like Color Tattoo. Beautiful rose gold shade.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to write a review for these eye shadows because they really are awesome. They are very shimmery, not glittery. There is a difference. I love how versatile these shadows are, and they really do last all day, even without shadow primer. To avoid the excess of loose shadow, try applying with your finger. I find that this is the best method to apply this shadow. I simply swipe the shadow with my ring finger and pat on the color, like you would an eye cream. It&#x27;s also more controllable this way...you&#x27;ll have a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; result using your finger, but is also very buildable if you want a dramatic look. I can&#x27;t stand when people give something a negative review when it quite possibly be that their method in using the product might be the problem. Not all makeup needs to be applied with a brush.</li>
    <li> This might have a little too much shimmer. It also gathers in the creases of my eye lids.</li>
    <li> Excellent for all eye colors but especially blue eyes.  It really makes them POP!!  Lasts all day and never transfers.  Took it on vacation and wore it everyday with different looks.  Versatile!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Infallible eye shadow! It&#x27;s seriously my favorite. I have been using it for quite some time now and have loved each and every color I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s long lasting, goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t crease. It&#x27;s the perfect eye shadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some colors I have bought are listed below and these are the dupes for some highend shadows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mac Satin Taupe - L’Oreal Bronzed Taupe&lt;br /&gt;Stilla Kitten - L’Oreal Iced Latte&lt;br /&gt;Mac pigment Tan - L’oreal Amber rush&lt;br /&gt;Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill eyeshadows dupe&lt;br /&gt;Urban Decay Half baked - L’Oreal Eternal Sunshine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for a one shadow look!&lt;br /&gt;To wear these as a one shadow look, I like to pat the shade on the lid for a more concentrated, metallic finish. Then use a fluffy brush to buff the shadow into the crease. It practically looks like you&#x27;ve worn two different shades, when you&#x27;re really only using one!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite eye shadows. It applies better with your finger which can sometimes be annoying but I love the look it gives and it lasts all day. I get asked what eyeshadow I have on often when I wear this. My sisters and mom loved it so I bought them one as well. It doesn&#x27;t crease like other shadows and is long wearing too which is a bonus. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this color is great!  Get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Really great basic color!  Not glittery, just the right amount of shimmer.  It seems to stay on for quite awhile and the application is really smooth!</li>
    <li> Love this color! I&#x27;m not a big eye shadow pro, but this color and quality is very good for a drug-store level product. I like the texture too, not a powder, not a liquid, goes on very well and stays put for the whole night!</li>
    <li> Amber Rush is an incredibly beautiful warm copper color. It&#x27;s very pigmented so a little goes a long way, especially for my small lids. I actually use my bronzer as a transition color w this shadow and it works really well. Lauren Curtis on YouTube has my favorite tutorial using this color. I believe it&#x27;s called Natural Prom Makeup. A good everyday shadow.</li>
    <li> I love this when it&#x27;s applied right. A little goes a very, very, very long way, so I&#x27;ve just been tapping my finger against it to pick up a little color and then patting my lids with it. That way it just yields a light rose-gold shimmer that&#x27;s subtle enough to be worn whenever. It complements blue-gray eyes very well.</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow. First, it is so easy to apply. You can use your finger or a brush and both will look good. Second, the color is beautiful. Third, it lasts a long time! I am a nurse so I run around for 12 hours sweating like crazy. After a 12 hour shift, I am always amazed to come home and find that the eye shadow is still there! Not as noticeable as 12 hours ago but definitely still there! Also, you really cant go wrong with it.You can use it by itself and your eyes will look great. I am definitely planning on trying out the other colors.</li>
