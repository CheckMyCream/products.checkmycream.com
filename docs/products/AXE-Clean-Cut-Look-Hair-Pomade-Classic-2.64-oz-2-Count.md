      <li>Love AXE products, they are the best!!!!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a good product that does what it&#x27;s intended to do well.</li>
      <li>My husband also tried it and thought it did a good job of keeping his hair in place while still leaving a combable.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, medium texture cream that works great.</li>
      <li>However, ideally a touch of water will work better for re-styling.</li>
      <li>This is great on shorter hair styles, or hair styles that are shorter on the sides and longer on top.  </li>
      <li>smell amazing.</li>
      <li>There&#x27; s a reason Axe products are so popular.</li>
      <li>He liked the manly &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; fragrance (citrus, pepper, and ginger).</li>
      <li>It gives a NICE Dr.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many of them, and the Peace Styling Control Cream is good stuff.</li>
      <li>He says it&#x27;s the best product he has used in his long life (lol) for control.</li>
      <li>First of all, the best part of this product is that the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Hair feels nice and soft, you&#x27;d never think there&#x27;s a paste in there , Great Product!!</li>
      <li>This gel works like hairspray in terms of its hold, but it is very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It does smell very strong with notes of citrus, ginger, and pepper.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love the effects of this Peace cream but liked it.  </li>
      <li>---it&#x27;s a mild pleasant sort of calming scent.  </li>
      <li>Overall I think it is very effective and a great hair styling product.</li>
      <li>Even better, it made for hair that still looked great the next day, which is uncommon with most styling products.  </li>
      <li>Its a very smooth creamy consistency.</li>
      <li>Wow , this makes my hair smell Amazing!!</li>
      <li>Nice smell, easy to work in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good medium hold and works great on short semi curly hair.</li>
      <li>but i have tried a bunch of different hair products and i like this the best.</li>
      <li>The cream is light with a nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t function as a shine pomade, more like</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another con when I added more product was that I didn&#x27;t achieve any additional hold</li>
      <li>a tube would give better control over the volume used and would be better for the remaining product than opening the jar and sticking your finger on</li>
      <li>fragrance is going to be the deal-breaker for most people</li>
      <li>For those who spend more time outdoors, you may have to reapply once or twice a day if you want to maintain the look.</li>
      <li>Make sure you run it through your hair thoroughly</li>
      <li>It gave my hair more body and volume.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell as most axe products do, you won&#x27;t really notice it unless you use a ton or someone is that close to you.</li>
      <li>this is pretty good as well.</li>
      <li>He tried both Axe &amp;#34;Spiked&amp;#34; and Axe &amp;#34;Messy&amp;#34; this week ... both had great results, but this was (by far) the sexiest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s because they work well, smell good, and are reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply: rub fingertip amount between fingers and spread/style it through damp hair.  </li>
      <li>I have rarely been satisfied with most styling creams.</li>
      <li>You will just need to like the fragrance, because it is fairly strong in this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is somewhat strong, just like all Axe products.  </li>
      <li>The product itself works just fine.  </li>
      <li>I have shoulder length fine textured hair.</li>
      <li>I like the holding power it provides and the fragrance is fine.  </li>
      <li>Just needed something to manage really fine hair.</li>
      <li>As with all of the Axe Peace line, the scent here is light and super appealing.</li>
      <li>I put this on my hands and spread lightly over my hair to create a thicker, controlled hair style.  </li>
      <li>and it gives that care free look without looking like you have glue in your hair.</li>
      <li>Also, it lacks the higher water consistency found in most grooming creams.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant but mild scent that is barely detectable once it’s in the hair.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t really “style” his hair, but more makes his best attempt to tame it.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this item, though I&#x27;m probably going to check out other Axe products to find a perfect fit.</li>
      <li>Use too much AXE CEASE FIRE cream and the appropriately named &amp;#34;Cease Fire&amp;#34; on the label will become a borderline &amp;#34;grease fire&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>He wants it to look placed there and more still even when the wind blows.</li>
      <li>The Peace line has kind of a citrusy, woodsy, gingery fragrance which is decidedly masculine.</li>
      <li>not bad smelling nor is it spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think someone who is more used to control cream might like this more, and not mind the heaviness, but I can only speak for us!</li>
      <li>It holds my hair well, a bit more weight than I normally would prefer.  </li>
      <li>Great product; a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I wanted a natural look with just a little bit of shine and this is the perfect product.</li>
      <li>This styling cream is great if you don&#x27;t want to use heavy pastes or gels.</li>
      <li>You can always add more, but if you use too much, you&#x27;ll have a very greasy</li>
      <li>This is a nice styling cream that can be used a couple of different ways.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not crazy about cream products where you dip your finger into the jar to use it.  </li>
      <li>Who (David Tennant style) CosPlay hair style for example if the hair is cut right to give you an example of how we used it.  </li>
      <li>For an Axe product has a mild (but pleasant) scent and it usually lasts all day for me.</li>
      <li>I also rather prefer this pomade-like substance in a jar, as opposed to the standard squeeze tube most of this stuff comes in.</li>
      <li>Likewise, I LOVE how touchable it left my boyfriend&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>When sniffing the jar the cologne-like scent of the control cream is strong, but barely detectable once applied to the hair.  </li>
      <li>He has other products in the Peace line that he likes and this one fits in nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple other Axe Spiking products (Glues and Gums), and this one leaves a nice &amp;#34;messy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as thick as a pomade but the Peace scent is a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>(it is much closer to &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; than it is to a &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>It is pretty much dead-on with providing a &amp;#34;medium shine&amp;#34; level.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Apply a fingertip&#x27;s worth while your hair is still damp and then style as you normal would.  </li>
      <li>The nice thing was that it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I really like how &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; smells: clean but masculine.</li>
      <li>, plastic jar is easy to screw open.  </li>
      <li>This will be potentially a great cream for those with very thick hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn’t have much body until after I wash it, apply a styling gel and torture it with a blow</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> This is almost identical to the previous &amp;#34;Shaggy&amp;#34; hair cream that Axe discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. Day-long hold without shiny/hard feel.</li>
    <li> I have slightly thin hair.  I put this on my hands and spread lightly over my hair to create a thicker, controlled hair style.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, it&#x27;s the best product for the price.</li>
    <li> I am nearly fifty-one years old and have thin, greasy, lifeless hair that hangs down like the sparse strands on a dirty, twenty-five-year-old mop.  I have to wash my hair every day with shampoo and conditioner.  I prefer using a brand of 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner for convenience and economy.  My hair doesn’t have much body until after I wash it, apply a styling gel and torture it with a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was pleasantly surprised after using the Axe Hair Styling Control Cream, Peace.  It gave my hair more body and volume.  My coworkers, Lydia and Michelle, asked me if I had gotten a haircut.  I told them no, but I was using a new styling cream.  I must admit that the extra body and volume does get me noticed by the opposite gender.  I believe it even makes me look younger.  Young people have thick, bouncy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Axe’s short, plastic jar is easy to screw open.  Using my right index finger, I apply a small dab to the palm of my left hand, rub both hands together and briskly run them through my freshly washed hair.  I then style and blow dry my hair.  There is no sticky residue, no flaking, and no obnoxious, lingering odor.  My hair is thick and bouncy again.  I highly recommend Axe; it has brought peace to my troubled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
    <li> As with all of the Axe Peace line, the scent here is light and super appealing. Likewise, I LOVE how touchable it left my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. He tried both Axe &amp;#34;Spiked&amp;#34; and Axe &amp;#34;Messy&amp;#34; this week ... both had great results, but this was (by far) the sexiest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous size will last you months and months! And the price-point is spot-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Live Peace!</li>
    <li> This styling cream adds control and some body without making hair crunchy or hard. The scent is terrific, refreshing with a touch of green and spice. Unlike some of the AXE products it does not overwhelm.The cream applies easily when rubbed between the hands and applied on wet hair. Less is definitely more when it comes to this product. A little dab will do, providing a flexible, healthy looking hold. It can also be applied to dry hair for a touch of control. It does wash  easily, a definite plus. This is a good product with great scent. Recommended</li>
    <li> I have coarse, short/medium (depending on the season) length hair that always requires some type of gel or cream for control.  This Axe Peace Control Cream come in a nifty but tiny 2.64oz jar with a twist off cap.  It&#x27;s easy to apply: rub fingertip amount between fingers and spread/style it through damp hair.  The scent is less &amp;#34;piney&amp;#34; than Axe hair gels and has a hint of &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; that my family and co-workers don&#x27;t find objectionable.  It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave hair overly stiff and crunchy.  Due to my hard-to-control hair, I have to use a generous amount each day to get my hair in order.  2.64oz seem barely enough for four weeks of daily use.</li>
    <li> Living in an area where the humidity can wreck havoc on your hair, I was hoping that it would control my curly hair and keep it from frizzing. It did not work as expected. When the weather did not have the high humidity and heat, my hair would stay in place with no frizz. The application went on smooth on my wet  hair but I would have a little bit for my hair to dry before I would go out</li>
    <li> This Axe Hair Styling Control Cream, gives you that shiny sleek hold. A little goes along way too much it will be a sticky strong smelling mess. It&#x27;s a good medium hold and works great on short semi curly hair. Axe makes great products...this is pretty good as well.</li>
    <li> (Though the prices keep going up and up and up in stores!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Axe overall -- I think their stuff is heavily fragranced and, honestly, overpowering. The one exception is their line of hair styling products. I&#x27;ve used many of them, and the Peace Styling Control Cream is good stuff. I like the &amp;#34;short and messy look,&amp;#34; so this works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints. And just enough fragrance to not turn heads and wrinkle noses everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> As they used to say in ads for another hair product, a little dab will do ya with Axe Peace Hair Styling Control Cream. I have rarely been satisfied with most styling creams. They either leave my hair sticky and looking like it’s been covered in plastic or fails to really keep my often unruly waves in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, especially when applied to damp hair shortly after I’ve shampooed and stepped out of the shower. A little bit on the fingertips, then rubbed together before applying, and Axe Peace gives me a nice hold, gentle enough to let me still maneuver my hair into a style I favor and without any stickiness. It has a pleasant but mild scent that is barely detectable once it’s in the hair.</li>
    <li> I like the futuristic funky shape of the jar, but when I opened the cap, it looks half empty. The white stuff is easy to spread on your hands, but make sure to rub it enough that it totally disappears on your hands or you will see white stuff on your head. What is not cool is that it doesn&#x27;t control your hair even if I rub it a few times. Nope, it is a bit disappointing. I like their Axe Whatever Messy Look Paste much better than this.</li>
    <li> As all the AXE products, this one is perfection too. makes my hair look amazing and holds all day without the dirty feeling or hard hair. very easy to use, not messy like the other gels. last forever since you only have to use a little bit. Of course the smell is the best part. smell amazing. great product. Love AXE products, they are the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a soft hair cream. The fragrance has a typical strong axe smell. My son loves the smell, my husband can do without it, but doesn&#x27;t hate it. For styling hair it holds my sons hair in place without being hard like a gel or sticky like a wax paste can sometimes be. Its a very smooth creamy consistency. My son wears his hair in what the kids call a flow. He has gone back to using the axe paste he was using before he tried this. He said because he doesn&#x27;t want for his hair to look so soft. He wants it to look placed there and more still even when the wind blows.</li>
    <li> My husband has wild, curly hair. He was really impressed with this product. He said it “made his hair look the way it would look if we lived somewhere with perfect humidity.” This is a high compliment from him. He doesn&#x27;t really “style” his hair, but more makes his best attempt to tame it. The smell is nice, but not overwhelming. This will be his new go-to hair product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Axe Control Cream ranks up there with my favorite of these products (I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s very similar in both application and behavior to Axe Styling Gum). It holds as firmly as a hair spray while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel. I&#x27;ve used a couple other Axe Spiking products (Glues and Gums), and this one leaves a nice &amp;#34;messy look&amp;#34; after you brush it out. It&#x27;s a nice look (and I&#x27;ve found that it kind of helps my thinning hair look a little less thin than the Glues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2.64 oz size means that you can take in your carry-on baggage for a plane flight - it slips under the TSA&#x27;s 3.4 oz limit for liquids and gels. That&#x27;s rather nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and just a bit - a drop - is needed to style my hair. Consequently, one tube of the stuff lasts me a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these styling creams. He usually uses a pomade but this works just as well. It&#x27;s not as thick as a pomade but the Peace scent is a nice light scent. There are no complaints, this is something I would buy for him again.</li>
    <li> My son has very thick curly hair, and he was eager to try this control cream to keep it tamed on days when it is out of control.  However, he really didn&#x27;t like the way it felt in his hair.  It&#x27;s a very thick cream---it has the look and feel to me of cold cream.  He felt it weighted down his hair far too much, and made it look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.  Some of this might just be because he isn&#x27;t used to a styling cream, but it bothered him enough that he wouldn&#x27;t give it a second try.  He did like the scent, and so did I---it&#x27;s a mild pleasant sort of calming scent.  I think someone who is more used to control cream might like this more, and not mind the heaviness, but I can only speak for us!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Axe styling creams - they have a great aroma and good hold, plus they are a good value!  This is a nice, medium texture cream that works great.</li>
    <li> This keeps your hair in place. I like that it lets you style your hair and keep it in place as well. This has a great hold., without causing frizzes. Great for humid areas hair will still hold up. This has a great scent to it as well. Overall a little bit goes a long way. Great for all males in my house as well.</li>
    <li> A solid product overall. For an Axe product has a mild (but pleasant) scent and it usually lasts all day for me.</li>
    <li> This gel works like hairspray in terms of its hold, but it is very easy to apply.  Apply a fingertip&#x27;s worth while your hair is still damp and then style as you normal would.  This cream produces a natural look that is only slightly a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.  Use other Axe creams for a messy look or a really wet look. 1 can last me 4-6 weeks.  You don&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
    <li> Use it every day, a little dab will do ya.</li>
    <li> Keep the hair stiff yet soft enough so it doesn&#x27;t flake.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This obviously is a personal preference but i have tried a bunch of different hair products and i like this the best. It keeps my hair in place but not stiff and crunchy.</li>
    <li> First of all, the best part of this product is that the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I also rather prefer this pomade-like substance in a jar, as opposed to the standard squeeze tube most of this stuff comes in. As for the hold, it&#x27;s a medium strength hold, I would say. For someone sitting indoors or in an office all day, you&#x27;ll probably only need to apply it in the morning. For those who spend more time outdoors, you may have to reapply once or twice a day if you want to maintain the look. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this item, though I&#x27;m probably going to check out other Axe products to find a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I see this as a four and one-half star item that I rounded down.  I like the holding power it provides and the fragrance is fine.  I&#x27;m just not used to using the smaller volume that you use with this cream versus a larger volume I normally use with a gel.  I find the smaller volume a little less easy to distribute through hair.  I&#x27;m also not crazy about cream products where you dip your finger into the jar to use it.  Seems like a tube would give better control over the volume used and would be better for the remaining product than opening the jar and sticking your finger on it is.  Overall though, these are fairly small complaints.  It&#x27;s a good product that does what it&#x27;s intended to do well.</li>
    <li> This is great on shorter hair styles, or hair styles that are shorter on the sides and longer on top.  It does smell very strong with notes of citrus, ginger, and pepper.  The cream itself is a thick cream, that you can use on dry hair or wet.  It works nicely to smooth sides of hair down against the side of the head, or to hold small stickups that form around the crown of the head down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a spiking cream, but it will hold some small spikes in very short hair.  I&#x27;d say it is a low control cream.  It does go on white as can be, especially on darker hair, but it dries clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is going to be the deal-breaker for most people - smell it before you buy it.  The product itself works just fine.  It gives a NICE Dr. Who (David Tennant style) CosPlay hair style for example if the hair is cut right to give you an example of how we used it.  You will just need to like the fragrance, because it is fairly strong in this product.</li>
    <li> This styling cream is great if you don&#x27;t want to use heavy pastes or gels. Make sure you run it through your hair thoroughly or else you may get some white streaks from the cream.</li>
    <li> Great product; a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, easy to work in but it doesn&#x27;t hold thick hair well enough to replace my current product (Axe for thick hair).</li>
    <li> Use too much AXE CEASE FIRE cream and the appropriately named &amp;#34;Cease Fire&amp;#34; on the label will become a borderline &amp;#34;grease fire&amp;#34;.  Seriously speaking, there is a very fine line between achieving that MEDIUM SHINE with this product and looking like someone lubed your hair down with a touch of petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR (For the record):  I have thick, medium-length, straight hair.  When I say &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; visualize a standard 80s&#x27; bowl-do haircut.  The amount of body/lift in my hair is likely 5% or less.  The Monkee&#x27;s and The Beetle&#x27;s had nothing on me (excluding musical talent).  That said, this product was all wrong for me.  My guess is that if you have shorter hair with some decent body to it you will like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LOOK/CONSISTENCY of the product in the container is similar to a firm shiny facial cream.  It is softer than a wax but not as soft and creamy as a facial cream.  Also, it lacks the higher water consistency found in most grooming creams.  It has a fairly firm, smooth surface but not as firm as a paste or putty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHINE &#x3D; MEDIUM.  It is pretty much dead-on with providing a &amp;#34;medium shine&amp;#34; level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLD &#x3D; LIGHT-ER (it is much closer to &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; than it is to a &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34;).  It will not hold up on a windy or dry hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOUCH &#x3D; mostly natural and soft unless you go overboard and apply to much...than it may end up only SLIGHTLY sticky in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another con when I added more product was that I didn&#x27;t achieve any additional hold but my hair did fall flat ala &amp;#34;Bowl-Do City U.S.A.&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SNIFF &#x3D; smells of spicy black pepper and touch of musk; not bad smelling nor is it spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COVERAGE &#x3D; very difficult to distribute evenly on hair; you must re-apply to the patchy areas which weren&#x27;t covered with the first application.  I applied it to DAMP (NOT wet) as I believe the container recommends that and I had zero confidence this would apply well on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your female runs her hands through your hair you will need to touch up your hair with some water to get back the shiny look.  You can &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34; re-style your hair without water since this product doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or crunchy.  However, ideally a touch of water will work better for re-styling.</li>
    <li> I was never on the axe band wagon but this is the only hair putty that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have wet hair or so weak that my hair doesn&#x27;t stay in the same position I styled it in. I found that I style it before I go to work and before I get to work I run my fingers through my hair a couple of times and restyle it a little and it gives that care free look without looking like you have glue in your hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, does what it says.</li>
    <li> Replaced Crew and Paul Mitchell</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to review this product since I was worried that based on what I&#x27;ve seen on commercials, the scent might be overpowering.  Thankfully, those fears were unfounded.  When sniffing the jar the cologne-like scent of the control cream is strong, but barely detectable once applied to the hair.  In my case, that was a positive, though I could see someone who wanted a pronounced scent being disappointed.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it does what it intents to do and well.  It held a style well and without looking heavy, crunchy or shiny.  Even better, it made for hair that still looked great the next day, which is uncommon with most styling products.  Overall I think it is very effective and a great hair styling product.</li>
    <li> Axe has so many great products! I have not had a bad one yet!  I have never used control cream on my hair and was leary what the final result was going to be. The cream is light with a nice scent to it. I have straight brown hair and it held my hair in the style that I wanted all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy in the future!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love the effects of this Peace cream but liked it.  It holds my hair well, a bit more weight than I normally would prefer.  This will be potentially a great cream for those with very thick hair.  The scent is subtle and good.</li>
    <li> This is a nice styling cream that can be used a couple of different ways.  You can apply it to wet hair, comb through, and let it air dry for a gelled look.  You can apply it to damp hair and blow dry for a clean look with some hold. Or, you can apply it to dry hair to curb flyaways and unruliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product.  Whatever you think is the correct amount, halve it and start from there.  You can always add more, but if you use too much, you&#x27;ll have a very greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is somewhat strong, just like all Axe products.  I like it, but not everyone will.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like how &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; smells: clean but masculine. Not too overpowering but when girls get close enough (lean on your head) they&#x27;ll notice. Kind of expensive for otherwise standard hair gel but it does give you some confidence.</li>
    <li> Just needed something to manage really fine hair. Hairs like a haystack, but don&#x27;t want something too metro. This is the ticket. Very small amount goes a long way. Keeps things under control without worries for the rest of the day. Smell isn&#x27;t all beauty parlor. A regular guy&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27; s a reason Axe products are so popular. It&#x27;s because they work well, smell good, and are reasonably priced. This hairstyling control cream is no exception. The Peace line has kind of a citrusy, woodsy, gingery fragrance which is decidedly masculine. That said, I had to try it for myself so I could see how it works and write a review. I have shoulder length fine textured hair. I used just 2 small dabs of this stuff and distributed it around the crown of my hair after I shampooed it. Then I dried it as usual. It gave my hair some lift and body and helped to keep it in place. The nice thing was that it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel greasy. My husband also tried it and thought it did a good job of keeping his hair in place while still leaving a combable. He has other products in the Peace line that he likes and this one fits in nicely.</li>
    <li> Control Cream by Axe is a lightweight styling product. It works well for medium hold with my greying wavy hair to help control some of the frizz that happens with my hair type. Its got much lighter ontrol than hair gel, so it makes you look like you have fuller hair without all the product. It has a pleasant smell as most axe products do, you won&#x27;t really notice it unless you use a ton or someone is that close to you. I like to use Bee&#x27;s Wax for a natural styling product, but its heavy and not always right depending on humidity.  I find this to be a great alternative to wax or gel.</li>
    <li> Axe &amp;#34;Cease Fire&amp;#34; Control Cream gave him a soft to the touch hold. He liked the manly &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; fragrance (citrus, pepper, and ginger). He says it&#x27;s the best product he has used in his long life (lol) for control. It doesn&#x27;t function as a shine pomade, more like a George Clooney &#x27;I use nothing on my hair and look how perfect it is&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 28th - Going on going on 3 months now on the the 3 jar.</li>
    <li> Wow , this makes my hair smell Amazing!! I wanted a natural look with just a little bit of shine and this is the perfect product. Hair feels nice and soft, you&#x27;d never think there&#x27;s a paste in there , Great Product!!</li>
