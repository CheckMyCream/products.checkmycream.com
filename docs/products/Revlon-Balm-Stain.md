<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this - creamy, long-lasting, and great colors! Doesn&#x27;t get sticky or caked!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great, inexpensive lip color. Will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> Today I received this in the mail and it I immediately put it on!! I loved the color right off the bat however, the color was a little too pink instead of a warm neutral honey pink that I was hoping to see. Regardless, I still loved it!! I have a light medium skin tone and it works perfectly with the color, but I honestly think this goes well with all skin tones since it is a neutral pink color. The long lasting power of this product is really great i just needed to re-apply once in the middle of the day and the color lasted really well. After I let the lip balm set, I kiss my hand to see if any of the product transfers and it only transfers a tiny bit. When i drink water or eat, my lips still had the color from the lip balm! I highly recommend this product and I will most definitely try out other colors! :)</li>
    <li> This is my go to lipcolor. It&#x27;s that perfect your-lips-but-better color. I&#x27;m very fair and I do wish they made an ever so slightly pinker color, but I still love this to death and keep one in my purse and one at my vanity at all times. It really does last a long time on the lips and even a soft stain, plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite product.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem as drying as others I have purchased. Maybe it&#x27;s this product or the company reformulated it.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this balm stain and very neutral; but darker lips just doesn&#x27;t work with this shade.</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  It wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; as it claims.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t last.  Boy, is it PINK!</li>
    <li> I like the way it applies on my lips - not sticky but adds color</li>
    <li> Love the color &amp;#34;Honey.&amp;#34; I think it would compliment many different skin tones. The stain doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips and it lasts for several hours.</li>
    <li> The color is not what I would call honey, but I still like it. It is pinker than you would expect.</li>
    <li> I really do love the color! It works nicely with my ginger/pale skin tone. BUT it doesn&#x27;t last too long. It says stain but I mean I could wipe it off.... Not much of a stain to me.</li>
    <li> I have the Kissable Lip Balm Stain in Darling and the stains in a couple shades, and I personally prefer the latter. Darling is a cute pink color, nice and neutral for work, but it leaves my lips feeling sticky after a little while. The color does stay for quite some time, but I hate having to reapply just because my lips aren&#x27;t smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay product, but not for a high price. I&#x27;ve definitely found similar products for a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> this balm stain is amazing I love it. I wasn&#x27;t going to get this color since it looked like a browish color but I looked up the color and on swashes and try ons and it looked more like a natural pink color which I love. Its super moisturizing, it does the job .I love everything about it. I been using it non stop so it has gotten super flat lol</li>
    <li> Love the product itself. Hated getting the plastic wrap off.&lt;br /&gt;And even after 3 uses, the printed letters rubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;But all of that doesn&#x27;t make me like the lipstick any less.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews of this product, I purchased it in stores in the color Honey. Other reviewers claimed that honey was a neutral color that looked good on most skin types, and I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I have very fair skin and this color complimented my skin tone fabulously. It gave me just enough natural coloring that it was noticeable that I was wearing lip color, yet still neutral enough to appear classy and professional. I have never been a fan of lipsticks/glosses/stains because I am low maintenance through out the day and do not want to reapply or worry about smudging, not to mention if it is windy out and my hair blows in my face and becomes uncomfortably stuck to my lip wear. I also have thinner lips that have never looked good with lipstick, it only seemed to draw attention to the thinness. However, when it comes to this balm stain, just bitten is a miracle! It is very moisturizing without leaving a thick coat behind, but really amps up the color and fullness of your lips! There is also a slight peppermint tingling when applied that is refreshing. I apply before work and after eating a meal, and I automatically look dolled up and refreshed. I wore very minimal makeup the other day, but had applied the balm stain, and my boyfriend commented on how &#x27;fancy&#x27; I appeared! This is a great buy and I can&#x27;t wait to purchase the colors Sweetheart and Romantic to accompany my different moods and events!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Stores like Ulta and CVS often have Revlon products on sale as buy one get one 50% off, so I suggest looking in stores for better deals than available online for this specific product</li>
    <li> I love this! It is a subtle pink and when I wear this I do not need a lip balm because it is hydrating enough. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the color shown in the picture is completely different from the actual product which is a pink and I also do not understand why it is called honey; the color has no similarities with what honey tone is supposed to look like. But I am really happy with the shade that it is and I would definitely recommend it as an everyday no hassle lip color.</li>
    <li> This stain lasts for quite a while, but it does stain your lips a dark crimson which I found odd because of the light color that it is. It does not protect against chapped lips and I find I do reapply it often, but the color is great and it has a nice texture.</li>
    <li> I never got to use this.  The cap must have been pushed so far down onto the tube that I couldn&#x27;t get it off.  I tried pliers and still couldn&#x27;t get it off.  I guess I will just go to the store and buy another because it&#x27;s not worth sending back....</li>
    <li> The Revlon Colorstay Lacquer Balms can&#x27;t be beat. I have them in 4 colors and really want them all. I am a beauty blogger so I review a lot of lip products online, but the only ones I actually wear on the daily are these. The Honey color is pinkish, without making me look like a little girl. When I want subtly pink lips, I just apply this. Nothing under or over it, and I don&#x27;t need lipliner with this. Plus, it somehow hydrates my lips instead of drying them. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with these and so far, I haven&#x27;t found a bad color yet.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this balm stain! This has turned into a daily lip product for me. The application is smooth, and it smells a bit minty. It stays on my lips until I eat, then I do have to reapply, but I expect that in any lip product.</li>
    <li> With the word stain in the name one would think it would last until you would remove it. Don&#x27;t waste ur money it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Seems to go on lighter than pictured, but otherwise, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great color, easy to apply. Nice and creamy texture. I love these&amp; will get a lot more colors!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Clinique chubby stick.  Great for the price.  I bought Honey and it is a great neutral color.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a Hollywood make up artist.  It is excellent and inexpensive.  Gives a matte finish and lasts longer then glossy lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Loved the color and the texture! Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> The color was just way too sheer for my liking.</li>
    <li> I like this color stain, I thought it would be a little more colorful on my lips, but it looks natural and smells minty. It&#x27;s very refreshing and it&#x27;s perfect for nude lip color look, especially if you want to pair it with a smokey eye look. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and got it yesterday. I got the color Honey and it was slightly darker than I was anticipating, but I love it!!! It feels good on my lips and it&#x27;s a great almost neutral. It does come off, onto my glass, when I&#x27;m drinking something, but it still leaves my lips with some color even after that. I definitely would recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! I love this stuff, it&#x27;s like my lips but better! I&#x27;m definably going to buy more when I can! :D</li>
    <li> This stain doesn&#x27;t really stain your lips. It&#x27;s a nice color though! Unfortunate.</li>
    <li> This looks like it&#x27;s going to a light bright pink when it&#x27;s really a dark pink almost purple. I wanted to look pretty and girly not goth and old. Other then that I like how it goes on smoothly. I let it sit on my lips before a Bloch and there&#x27;s a stain. I just want I different color now</li>
    <li> Awesome color, works perfectly for so many different skin tones! I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s a perfect nude color. I love the color-rich matte finish, even though I do have to reapply occasionally.</li>
    <li> My most use lip product ever! It does what it claim - moisturizing balm (not for dry dry lips but it helps) and stain. This color is natural, my lips but better color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence on if I&#x27;d purchase this again. For reference, I&#x27;m quite pale with warm undertones and medium pigmented lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that the color Honey is a perfect mid-toned mauvey pink. It leans a teeny bit to the coral side once I&#x27;ve applied it. It is a beautiful color that looks natural and I find that it would be very versatile with just about any makeup look and any skin tone. The packaging is nice- I like that it twists up rather than having to sharpen it. The chubby pencil look is adorable as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s Revlon&#x27;s claim to fame for this product: &amp;#34;It‚Äôs a pampering balm fused with a lightweight lipstain in an adorable chubby crayon. Just Bitten Kissable Balm Stain gives softer, smoother lips with a perfect flush of color that lasts hour after hour.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pampering? Eh, maybe. It has a delicious mint feeling that feels nice on the lips when first applied but instantly disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softer, smoother lips? No. I exfoliated before applying this product and I felt like I had to press hard to get color to show up and then it felt a little like...moist chalk. It settled into the very few lines I have on my lips and made them look dry. Applying a balm or chapstick before this is necessary if you want your lips to look smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts hour after hour? I can say, with confidence, that this does last quite a while. I&#x27;ve worn it to work several times and I can always detect a faint flush of this when I get home 9 hours after first applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For around $9 at my local grocery store, this is quite steep when the claims Revlon makes aren&#x27;t exactly accurate, at least not in my case. I love the color and the packaging is adorable but I&#x27;m sure that there are other products that are more moisturizing at a better price.</li>
    <li> It is very good for summer, spring, and all year long ! I love exacly that color: shiny nude pink. Unfortunately they stopped selling it where I live and fortunately I found it on Amazon, and I was so happy that ordered 3 balms in that color! Love it!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is really good and I bought a number of them in different colors.  It stays on for a long time which is great.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I wanted just a little colour that stays and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
    <li> I have very pale lips and this is just enough color to give them some color. On me it still looks very natural, but on others with darker lips, it would probably be darker. Lasts for hours and looks great. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Um okay, so they weren&#x27;t kidding when they said &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34;!! It goes on super smooth, just like a lip balm, and definitely feels like a balm while you have it on, too. I&#x27;d say the &amp;#34;flush of color&amp;#34; is a little deceiving. This stuff packs a punch, the color is going to wear exactly like the color on the tube. The color &amp;#34;lovesick&amp;#34; has very vivid, rich color, which was a bit of a surprise. I was expecting a more subtle hue, and this stuff is anything but subtle. That being said, I still really liked it! It lasted all night at a wedding with no re-application. And when I woke up the next morning my lips were still as bright as the night before. So, hey, it stains!</li>
    <li> Perfect color to go with anything, and top with anything.  The pic looks pinker but this a neutral color, nearly brown with pink tones.  Goes on the most like an actual balm than any other stain I&#x27;ve used.  I also have sweetheart and cherish.  Sweetheart is a fuschia (that pic here on Amazon makes it look redder than it is) and is my fave for going out and lasts longest.  Cherish is a pale almost lilac pink for when I&#x27;m in the mood for it.  Out for a walk or to market etc.</li>
    <li> Lighter than I anticipated but still a good choice!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best nudes I have very flattering.  Later found out I have a few other friends with different skin tones who also love this! Would buy again if I run out.</li>
    <li> Great daytime shade. I wear this two ways. Like a regular lipcolor and as stain. For a stain, I apply and leave on while I&#x27;m getting dressed, then wipe off the moisturizing balm. I&#x27;m left with a stain/base that I can put any lip color over. This is my preferred technique, even when my lipstick or gloss wears off, I still look fresh.</li>
    <li> Love the color tint this provided, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and isn&#x27;t blotchy at all.</li>
    <li> The color is much pinker than shown in the photo here. I found that although it is a &amp;#34;stain,&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t leave color on my lips as long as I had hoped. The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; name is truer- I like the smooth feel of the product on my lips.</li>
    <li> I got this in Honey, and though I&#x27;m not thrilled with the color on ME, it overall is an amazing balm stain. Be sure to google search swatches or example pics of each color because the photos here don&#x27;t do it justice. Honey is much darker than the pic and looks a bit like a natural nude pink only a few shades darker. I&#x27;m still giving this 5 stars because it lasted longer than I expected, felt great, and arrived in the mail quickly.</li>
    <li> The color is very light/natural. But this is definitely not a stain. It sits on top of your lips and rubs off like any other lipstick. It&#x27;s not a bad lipstick, it&#x27;s just not what I was expecting as a &amp;#34;lip stain&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the reviews that said &amp;#34;just enough natural coloring that it was noticeable&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I have never been a fan of lipsticks/glosses/stains because I am low maintenance through out the day and do not want to reapply&amp;#34;.  This product is exactly what I wanted. The color is light and natural looking.  So much so that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing it, but just adds a hint of color. And it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky. I forget I have it on because I don&#x27;t feel it on my lips.  Great product and perfect for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t stay on well &amp; looks cheap</li>
    <li> Definitely more of a pastel pink but do love coverage!</li>
    <li> Really good neutral color that makes your lips feel good. It has good staying power and is inexpensive. I have paid a lot more money for products with more of a designer name-this beats all of them, hands-down. It is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I got the color &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; and the color was a nice neutral, however it the lid did not fit well and the item did not look new, even though it was sealed. Overall it was a good product.</li>
    <li> Even though the name has the word &#x27;balm&#x27; in it, it could really be more moisturizing. It&#x27;s possible that the peppermint oil it contains is drying out my lips a little bit however the staining effect this has is long-lasting fades evenly over the course of the day. It&#x27;s only comfortable to wear if I put on a separate lip balm before the stain, which was disappointing but hey, I use plenty of lip balm anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shade Honey looks different in person as compared to the picture Amazon shows. In reality the plastic tube is a neutral, muted color, less pink than shown here and the balm itself is a dusky rose brown color. I was initially put off by how dark it looked in the tube yet when applied it looks less brown and more berry, at least that&#x27;s how it appears on me (pale and cool-toned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find just one thin layer does the trick. It takes a minute for the color to adjust and the more you put on the deeper the stain becomes. There&#x27;s an orange-red undertone that occurs if I keep layering it on, so I don&#x27;t apply it more than twice throughout the day, nor do I need to since it leaves such a stain behind.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my regular stain was out and allergies have dried out my lips. &#x27;Rendezvous&#x27; is a fantastic coral orange with a creamy texture on application. THIS DOES NOT LAST. After an hour (with no eating or drinking) the balm turns into a chalky sludge that collects in any cracks or dry spots on your lips. The stain left behind is not the same initial color, but rather a fuchsia pink. I also found this portion to bleed outside of the lipline, giving me the look of a child who&#x27;d been licking their lips all day. Reapplying does little to remedy, as the outer pink ring remains and the chalkiness returns shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because the color is great on application. I like the texture and peppermint smell too, but if you&#x27;re buying for that, just get a tinted lip balm.</li>
    <li> with all the hype , i expected more.It has a minty flavor but the color consistency was not great. however,its good for everyday.</li>
    <li> Just perfect product, it&#x27;s different from Clinique Chubby Stick but still really good, so soft and tinted, it&#x27;s a truly balm stain.</li>
    <li> This is a nice subtle color.</li>
    <li> Love the color but I was hoping it would stay on longer. If you don&#x27;t mind re-applying every few hours this feels good on lips and doesn&#x27;t seem to bleed.</li>
    <li> continue to love this product even tho it is hard to find.  goes on easy - provides smooth, moisturizing lip color</li>
    <li> This is a nice color but definitely a little darker than I was expecting.  I am extremely fair (pale, some might say) and this color is apparent on my lips.  That is to say, you could not think this was my natural lip color but it&#x27;s quite flattering.  I like the color and the moisturizing factor of the balm but wish the stain was a bit more stain-y.  Not the perfect balm stain but a good contender for good enough.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a just slightly more mauvey, more neutral, less bright pink, the &amp;#34;your natural lip color but better&amp;#34; shade on myself as this color is praised for. (For better reference, see the swatch of the color photo, not the photo of the stick). However on me, very fair skinned and blue undertone, this color at first was nice, but developed later into a more hot pinky shade. It also collected in the lines of my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that said, I actually really love all of Revlon&#x27;s Balms, almost all of them and it really just depends on your skin tone. I personally like the light mint smell and the benefit for me of the stick versus a lipstick is the application and the stain factor. The color lasts longer even when it fades, smears less and I find that the pencil is still smooth and fun to apply, but isn&#x27;t as delicate and intense as a standard lipstick (the pigmentation is great I just mean you can layer and apply more efficiently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this color, which I do still wear, I didn&#x27;t fall in LOVE with as many do but this is just with my fair redheaded complexion. It may indeed work for you as it has been praised by most, either way, Revlon&#x27;s Balms (Balm Stain/Matte Balm/Lacquer Balm) are all worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is really nice ... easy to apply because of the pencil shape.</li>
    <li> its a nice lipsstick, it has a nice flavour mint, but it doesnt last that long, u have to reaply every second and the stain is that remarkable either, but I love it cause is like a lipbalm with color and last a litle long</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d consider a true &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; as it will still blot off. However, it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as regular lipstick. I like the color which is quite sweet and subdued.</li>
    <li> The honey color is great- its a very natural every day work appropriate color. Its not as much of a stain as I wanted though. Doesn&#x27;t last more then a few hours and rubs off if you eat or drink.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Stays on a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade, goes on smooth</li>
    <li> I really like this balm. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all, but when it dries, it dries out my lips as well, so I do end up putting a bit of Vaseline or chapstick on. Its also a very hot pinkish color once it dries, and its nothing like a mauve color (as shown in the picture). Overall though, I am pleased with this stain. It lasts for about 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I like the color, but it isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; as I felt no residual moisture.  Since it is a natural color, I can&#x27;t say it is really a stain. I have paid more for products that are no better, so I think it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Best lip stain I&#x27;ve used, it looks good as it fades.  Does dry the lips out some but I use a chap stick on top and its no problem.  Honey color is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love the color but wish it was a bit darker.</li>
    <li> Perfect neutral shade and very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I love things that have a minty tingle to them, so that was good. I should know it&#x27;s a gamble to buy lipstick on line, but it was much pinker than I expected - thought it would be more of a taupe-y nude. Doesn&#x27;t last particularly long, either.</li>
    <li> Not seller&#x27;s fault but Revlon &#x27;s. The actual color that comes on your lips is a horrible drab shade  of coral not a pretty pink as advertised or as is on the outside tube. Hate it!!!! Waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> These lip crayon stains are quite awesome.  They glide on like butter and last for a good while.  I do have to reapply after eating.  They are not sticky, they have a creamy feel to them.  I like them so much I have ordered quite a few of these.  They are also quite affordable.  They glide on sheer but are buildable.  They are definitely worth a try for anyone looking for something new.</li>
    <li> Cap comes off too easily!  Came apart in my purse and made quite a mess!</li>
    <li> I picked this color because it wasn&#x27;t real red or bright pink. It complements my fair skin. Friends liked the color on me.</li>
    <li> The 1st time i applied it it came on light no color . Once u start using it will get more pigmented  my lips but better colour . Reminds me Mac cosmo but a glossier version . My lips dont feel that dry using it .i love revlon matte balms even more a brownish muave colour</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The color is perfect for a natural look and it feels great on. I just wish it would last a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> First off, I love the color of this stain. It does match my lip color which doesn&#x27;t make a difference but you can see the color. They do stay on for quite a long time and the stain glides on smoothly on my lips. I do get dry lips and when I applied it onto that, SOME od the product would appear darker on those chapped areas. Maybe before you apply these, make sure you moisturize your lips with a balm and then apply it. When you do apply it, it keeps your lips quite moisturized for a while also so that is a huge plus! This is an everyday color for me. Its a color you can wear everyday if you like a more natural look :) I highly recommend these and I am in love with this! They come with a lot of product and you dont have to keep re-applying all the time so a tube of this will last you quite sometime depending on how often you use it. I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months now and I have not twisted the product out yet. Yes! It lasted me that long but thats because I dont put too much of the product on my lips. Once a day is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a twist stain do its like a crayon but for the face. hahaha I love it! Makes me feel like a kid! I highly recomment you to buy this! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this lip stain. It&#x27;s just slightly bolder than my natural lip color, so it looks natural. The color stays a long, long time, and I don&#x27;t get the stickiness that bothers me about lipstick. This has become one of my daily staples.</li>
    <li> This is smooth and a little lighter color than it appears, but goes on so smooth it works.</li>
    <li> love this color, very subtle</li>
    <li> This lip product is AWESOME. I was hesitant because my computer makes this color look almost beige or nude. I will end up stocking up because I find myself using it everyday for school -- it&#x27;s a perfect pink that looks like my natural lip color -- but is actually a pinker, rosier upgrade of my natural lip color (which is like a beige-ish pink, think Asian without makeup). I can see this color working for pretty much anyone. My only wish is that it would last longer - it comes off immediately when I eat or drink, but if it was, it wouldn&#x27;t have such a soft, perfect, dewy, moisturized texture. It&#x27;s a tradeoff. Don&#x27;t let the color on your computer screen fool you -- this is a gentle, rosy pink color that you could wear everyday.</li>
    <li> Lovely Color and glides on smoothly.</li>
    <li> The color on this stain is subtle, at least for me. It is wonderful to pull a whole look together though. I can&#x27;t say how long the stain lasts, but it&#x27;s better than nude lips!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an everyday wear lipstick, and this stain was highly recommended. I bought it in Honey, and when I first put it on, it looks and feels great, however within a couple of hours it changes into a deep bright pink that clashes with my complexion (ends up looking more like the swatch shown for Sweetheart). I like it, but instead of using it every day like I originally intended, it is reserved for quick outings.</li>
    <li> The color appears more pinkish than I expected. But it does last and won&#x27;t make your lip dry. Will try another tone.</li>
    <li> Nice color, moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have olive skin, and most lip stuffs tends to get really orange on me. I assumed this would be more of a neutral color, but it&#x27;s a soft pink. It looks good, but I suspect when I lose my tan, this stain will go into the pile at the back of the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good stain, though, and lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> love this color. it&#x27;s now my daily go to. last longer than lipstick but not quite as long as a normal stain. it&#x27;s my new favorite lip product.</li>
    <li> Amazing color, amazing product. The staying power of these isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; so the name is a bit misleading, but I love it anyways!</li>
    <li> Color is nice, very subtle. My lips, but better. The boyfriend hates when I wear lipstick but he never comments on this one. And it makes me feel great!</li>
    <li> Honey is the best color for fair skin people. I am an Indian but fair skin and it looks good for daily use purpose.&lt;br /&gt;And my Indian friends with darker skin tone try smitten or Romantic (coral) shade. But I do want to try romantic myself for occasional wear.</li>
    <li> The formula is nice enough; there&#x27;s a pleasant \\&quot;mintyness\\&quot; to it, and has fairly decent staying power, although it is pretty drying. You&#x27;ll need a balm, but this is the case with most cheap-ish lipstick. But as for the color, &#x27;Honey&#x27; is too blue-toned for my skin. I&#x27;m a natural redhead with neutral/pink undertones to my skin, and no matter what other makeup colors I&#x27;m wearing, or even if I wear this shade alone without any other makeup, it looks bad and uncomplimentary. Almost if you mixed taupe with pink and grey. I can&#x27;t imagine how this color would look good on anyone, but if you cruise over to MUA (makeupalley.com), there are plenty of women who rave about this shade. Clearly, I&#x27;m not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: Apparently this shade &#x27;Honey&#x27; is a dupe for Revlon&#x27;s Lip Butter in &#x27;Pink Truffle&#x27;, so if you already own that shade, then it&#x27;s another reason to pass on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.5 stars</li>
    <li> I really really like the lipstick.  The honey color is the most neutral color offered and its always out of stock in local drugstores.  It&#x27;s always Amazon to the rescue!  This product stays on better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried, at least half the day. I do reapply after lunch.  I find the colors to be somewhat loud, but with practice am learning to love them.&lt;br /&gt;Sweetheart is intense pink. The orange color is neon orange. The honey is what I&#x27;d call mauve/beige. Mostly mauve.&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to success with these is to use a small amount and blend with finger or blot with a tissue. Then it sort of looks natural and not thick like lip gloss tends to be. The colors blend together very well and that&#x27;s my favorite way to wear them. I put on the pink or orange, blot it and then put the honey over it. Or put the orange and pink over it. Love them!</li>
    <li> I love Revelon&#x27;s Just Bitten Kissing Balm Stain. It is the only lip stain that actually stays on my lips. The only problem I have is that it dries out my lips and if I wear it too often, my lips become cracked and sore.&lt;br /&gt;The color &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; is very mauve-y... kind of like &amp;#34;your natural lip color... but better&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Its really great and this particular color honey looks so natural I wear it almost everyday. I have others as well and Honey is my Fave.</li>
    <li> This balm stain is so moisturizing and the color is amazing as well. It almost has a minty type of feeling on your lips, but it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything, it&#x27;s a nice feeling. The stain stays on for several hours after the balm has soaked in and/or wears off, but it came off easily with a makeup remover wipe. This was a nice change from some other stains that I&#x27;ve tried that are a pain to remove. It also stained a nice consistent color, not blotchy like some stains can be. It comes in many colors and I have almost all of them, but Honey is my favorite! Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I decided to try a little bit of this again after finding it buried in my makeup drawer. I&#x27;ve very recently changed my hair to a copper red color from my natural blonde and oh my goodness does this look good with red hair! It&#x27;s insanely hard to find makeup that flatters a fair skinned complexion with bright ginger hair so I&#x27;m incredibly happy I never threw this out! It&#x27;s a soft rosy color and it looks very natural which is something I really look for in lip stains/sticks. It&#x27;s moisturizing to my lips but it does wear off after a few hours and will come off a small bit on cups and straws, but no where near as much as a plain lip stick would. If you have lighter red hair, you should seriously try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I originally bought it about a year or two ago I had natural medium ash blonde hair and this balm just didn&#x27;t look right on me. It looked harsh and dramatic in a trashy way. It was making me look like Courtney Love, to be completely honest. I had a couple of other blonde friends try it out and they got the same kind of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have fair skin and lighter blonde hair, unless it&#x27;s a very golden shade or a strawberry blonde, I&#x27;d advise you against the \\&quot;Honey\\&quot; shade. Especially if you&#x27;re an ash blonde, STAY AWAY! The warmth of the pink will really clash and wash you out and give you an almost sickly pallor to your skin.</li>
    <li> I have bought this balm stain in numerous colors! It does a great job of moisturizing your lips AND adding color. Plus, as the color wears off over the hours, it leaves behind a stained color on your lips. I&#x27;m really bad about remembering to re-apply lip color during the day, so this is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This looks and feels great.  Just enough color to look finished but not made up, and the texture is so smooth and silky.  I also appreciate not having to mess with a sharpener.  I&#x27;ve ordered multiples of this one.</li>
    <li> Pretty color, but is drying on my lips. Color does not last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;no lipstick&amp;#34; look, just enhances my lip color.</li>
    <li> when i got it i was expecting a litter pink color, its darker than what it looks here, but still i like it and it leaves a mint feeling on your lips when you put them on.</li>
    <li> Super convenient, not drying, and perfect everyday lipwear for me since the color basically looks like my natural lipcolor, but a little better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in honey. At first, it&#x27;s a lovely color, goes on smoothly, feels great &amp; has a subtle shine to it. It feels as good as wearing a non waxy Chapstick. It felt like it was long wearing &amp; I felt confident wearing this. I wore it inside an office for a 1.5 hr meeting (no eating or drinking). When I left, I glanced in the mirror and was horrified that it had changed to a faded blotchy orange/red disaster! It looked like I had a kool-aid stain on my lips. I recommend that if you buy this shade, you try it on at home &amp; recheck the shade around an hr before wearing it in public. I&#x27;ve never in my life had a lipstick change color on me like this. I reapplied this again this evening with the same results. Into the trash :(</li>
    <li> Again, I am an addict to lip color and glosses. I have a ton of lip product. I am very happy with this one. I bought it in honey. It is long lasting and has a pretty good stain. I compared it to Clinique, and it is just my opinion, but this \\&quot;Revlon\\&quot; is a better product for half the price. I just wish they would bring out more natural look colors. It isn&#x27;t very sheer, so the color you see is pretty much are going to get. I tried 2 colors and they are pretty true. Feels nice on your lips.</li>
    <li> Oh how I wish this had been invented before my wedding day, because that ultra-drying paint-on spackle stuff I used was awful. I can say I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of long-last lip color there is - stains, glosses, lipsticks, at least 2 other brands in very similar packaging...and this beats all the others. It&#x27;s the perfect texture, longest lasting, and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t flake, leave that outer-lip-ring, or fade in patches like some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;Colors: I have Honey, which is a great everyday neutral, although I do wish it was a wee less pink and a bit more neutral. Adore is a great bold, wine-colored fall shade. And Smitten is a very wearable hot pink...which I know sounds like a contradiction in terms, but I&#x27;m a redhead who can pull it off (and redheads can rarely swing a hot pink lip). Even my mother can pull this one off without looking wacky. Romantic was a bit of a disappointment for me, as I was hoping for a classic red, but this one is too orangey and  unflattering on my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin is very fair and for some reason it looked darker on my lips, with a too strong red tint. I still manage to use it almost daily, I love the staying power. At the end of an 8 hour day of work, the tint stays on my lips and gives me a cute reddish healthy look. Paired with a gloss touchup during the day, makes it look gorgeous. I will buy this again once I&#x27;m done with the current one.</li>
    <li> Not the color it looks!  I was expecting a brownish pink, like the photo.  It&#x27;s baby pink.  I&#x27;m Norwegian/German/Irish and this color is too light for me.  Who can wear this?  No, really, who?  I&#x27;m looking for someone to give it to, as it will never work for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice shade, definitely natural looking! However, find it a bit drying after a while with limited staying power. Like that it is mess free and pretty reasonable in price :)</li>
    <li> There has been this lipstain fad that has been growing and they have been popping up in every drugstore line. I was really interested in them because I dont really like wearing lipsticks. I feel like you have to reapply lipstick inorder for your lips to look good all day. I am really lazy and I dont like to reapply or touchup, I just like to put things on and hope that they stay put all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for Revlon&#x27;s lipstain after reading reviews and passing up the other lines of lipstains. I did TONS of research because I hate purchasing a product I dont like, then going through the trouble of returning it. I picked up two colors which were Honey and Smitten. For reference I believe I am a NC30 skintone and asian. Honey is probably the most best and \\&quot;My lips but better\\&quot; type of color. Out of the whole line, I think that this is the most universal color. I believe that any girl can look good with this color, I really do! Smitten was also a nice color but it was a bit bright for me. I am the type of person that likes to wear nudes and MLBB colors. This color was nice, but I dont find myself reaching for it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the wear, it does last quite a while and does not seem as drying as other lipstains. For me, even if the color fades or wears off, it still looks good. It has a peppermint type of scent and it goes on really smooth. Its nice that its one of those retractable pencil things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product especially the color Honey. Its easy to wear and its a really nice color. This can get pricey if you want to collect all of them, but finding deals at the drugstore is probably your best bet. This is an awesome product, and I have really enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> I like the color this leaves when I first apply it.  It&#x27;s a nicer than your lips kind of color, a pinky neutral.  Unfortunately, it leaves behind an ugly stain nothing like the color as applied.  On my lips it is a weird orange-y pinky melon color.  Very unattractive.  I have one other Balm Stain from Revlon and I have the same problem.  Lovely when applied, orange stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy any more Revlon Balm Stains for this reason.  I prefer the Revlon Lip Butter formula.  I have 8 of them and counting! FYI, the Revlon Lip Butter in Pink Truffle is similar to the Balm Stain in Honey out of the tube and does not leave a stain.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the best (like-your-natural-lip) lip color, \\&quot;Honey\\&quot; is the one for you.  I am Asian but I am sure this color will go for any skin color out there.  It comes on like a maroon color in the beginning but after one application and waiting out for half a minute to one minute and applying the second coat, you should be set for hours on.  It actually looks better as the color starts to set on the lips.  It&#x27;s perfect for going out everyday to going to work or party because it seems pretty natural.  It makes your lips have that pop of color but not too much.  The balm smells minty like menthol so don&#x27;t worry about a waxy, lipstick smell.  After exfoliating and all, the product should glide on the lips smoothly.  For an 8-10 hour day, I would say it&#x27;s necessary to reapply like one more time midday, unlike most others that cause splotchy fading, requiring for constant reapplication, which can be so annoying.</li>
    <li> Love this color and keeps my lips moist and pretty!!!</li>
    <li> I herd of this from a friend and am glad I bought it. It is very easy to put on, mistake proof and stays on very well. Would buy again. Does NOT dry lips :)</li>
    <li> I love it.  It was a little on the pink side for me but I have grown to like it and I want to get&lt;br /&gt;more in different colors.  Easy to apply.  Love it</li>
    <li> I found this lipstick via YouTube and it had great reviews from lots of girls doing reviews an first impression videos. I was excited to get my package so when it arrived I quickly opened it, applied it and loved the results, a my lips but better color. Unfortunately about an hour later I was left with bright pink lips!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I called amazon up and explained my situation and arranged a return. I was told I had seven days to complete it so I decided to give it one more shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days I fell in love with it too much to return it- bright pink stained lips and all. I hardly notice the brightness anymore, it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour and my lips are back to their normal color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving four stars because I love the product but the brightness is a downside.</li>
    <li> but it made my lips look so dry. You have to completely exfoliate and really moisturize the night before is what I found. I do live in a dryer climate, and I rarely wear this because it makes my lips look dry!</li>
    <li> the balm stain goes on pretty easily but doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would have hoped from a lip stain.</li>
    <li> 001 Honey is a very natural mauve shade with a little shine. It goes on very creamy and the stain it leaves enhances your natural lip color. It also has a refreshing mint smell. The only downside to this product that after a couple hours it becomes pretty dry and I have to re-apply bc I don&#x27;t like dry lips</li>
    <li> Out of all the lip stains I&#x27;ve tried (including ones from victoria&#x27;s secret) i like these the best. While they don&#x27;t last for a super long time, they go on smooth and i love the color. I would blot lightly after application and then apply a moisturizing Chapstick. i use the blue Chapstick afterwards. But i love the color and that it isn&#x27;t sticky like lip gloss, and it does stay longer than lipstick without transferring to your partner.</li>
    <li> I love lip stains!  I can use them in the morning and am pretty much good to go the rest of the day.  I was so excited to try these, but I was a bit disappointed.  First of all, they are drying.  I must use a moisturizing lipstick over the top which defeats the purpose.  They are touted as a balm, but I see nothing soothing about them. Minty?  Hmmmm.....not so much.  The brighter colors do a little better as a stain; the paler shades are extremely light.  I bought 5 in a bundle so I have used a variety of shades.  I won&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect lip make-up! Revlon ColorBurst Balm Stain is emollient, a bit shiny, and has a pleasant minty taste/smell. The first time my husband kissed me, and I was wearing Balm Stain, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get him to stop!  He&#x27;d kiss me, look at me and smack his lips and then come back for another and another. LOL  What fun!  ;-)  I had previously tried the Covergirl Outlast Lipstain in Teasing Blush and it&#x27;s very pretty but it seems to me that it&#x27;s a bit drying. Now I start with the Covergirl, outlining my lip shape and then I fill in with this Revlon ColorBurst Balm Stain. I carry the Revlon with me all day long and reapply as needed. Now my lips look fabulous all day long. I only need to reapply after eating. The stain lasts really long. I like never having to sharpen it. It&#x27;s not a regular pencil. It&#x27;s a roll-up! Love it! I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could.</li>
    <li> If I could only keep one lip product from my entire collection, this balm stain in Honey would be it! I have products from drugstore to high end so that&#x27;s saying something. This is a perfect neutral pink-mauvey color. I have light-medium skin with yellow undertones (NC25) and this is a perfect MLBB (my lips but better) shade on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing and feels light on the lips. There is a mild minty scent and flavor to it. I never have issues even if my lips are dry, it glides on and looks great. It can cover pretty well (zero patchiness) but is not as opaque as say a matte lipstick. As for the staining, with this particlar color the stain left behind is a slightly darker pink and not as long lasting as the more vivid colors in this line. I recommend allowing an hour or so after application for the stain to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; and last longer. I typically get about 4-6 hours wear before reapplying and when it does wear away it does so evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chubby stick packaging makes it super easy to just apply on the go. I will always go back to this product and repurchase it. Never let this one go Revlon!</li>
    <li> This is my new go to lipstick. I bought the Honey color and I love the way it goes on like chap stick but the color stays on all day. It also has a great minty scent.</li>
    <li> This is a soft pink, sheer lip color. NOT a honey color. There is s mint flavor as well. It&#x27;s fine, but I thought, based on the pic, it was more honey colored. It&#x27;s not - at all.</li>
    <li> The texture is nice and has great coverage.  The color is very pretty on my pale skin tone as well.  Not always easy with pinks.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because of the many amazing reviews, hoping for a stain that would last. Hardly gives any color and the Honey is rather more pastel pink than I expected, and it&#x27;s completely gone within about an hour. Roughly equivalent to lip gloss, without the moisturizing. Overall disappointed, but due to all the fabulous reviews across the internet from other people I have to assume maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry.</li>
    <li> My intent was to replace a Clinique Chubby Stick that had run out. This was much less expensive, and has the same feel on my lips.</li>
    <li> This product goes on feeling like a high end lip balm and looks exactly like lipstick! No yucky lipstick taste! Rather this lip balm/stain has a light/faint mint flavor (at least this shade does). AND it has great staying power üòè! What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;MyaVT</li>
    <li> Though this looks very light pink it isn&#x27;t as pale as might be expected.&#x27;im not a light pink person but this color is great. It&#x27;s my go to lip color now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! This color is very natural as well, adding a natural color to your lips.</li>
    <li> This product did not dry out my lips as all lip stains in the past that I&#x27;ve tried have. The color is not overwhelming. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hope, but it definitely lasts longer than my favorite lip stick and gloss. I&#x27;ll probably try a few more colors!</li>
    <li> I would never, ever buy this product again, because it is nearly impossible to remove the outside plastic covering without either breaking a fingernail, stabbing yourself with a knife or blunting the pointed tip.(In my case, all three of these events happened)  The product itself is probably okay, but my anger level after trying to remove the plastic, is off the charts! Revlon should be ashamed...</li>
    <li> I got the Honey color and I really like it! The only draw back for me was I thought it would be more of a soft pink, but I found that it is a little more bold, which was fine. It has a minty smell to it which was a pleasant surprise...it didn&#x27;t leave my lips tasting like mint, it only smelt minty when I put it on, after that I didn&#x27;t notice it. It stays on nice for a good portion of the day too. Overall, I really like this product and will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Honey is a great your-lips-but-better color. I have very fair skin so when I saw how dark the color is I was very skeptical but it works very well. It is moisturizing but it won&#x27;t save your lips if they&#x27;re chapped and peeling.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Great product</li>
    <li> I hate lipstick and haven&#x27;t use one for a long time. Tired to have a washed face all the time, and with my lips chapped most of the winter, despite the fact that I use lip balm, maybe not as often as I should, decided to give this a try. If it will give a light/sheer color to my lips and keep it soft, it would be a win win situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to say that I love this color - honey. It gives a sheer and subtle color to my lips for every day use. I have noticed that if I eat something as soon as I apply, the color will be gone, however if I apply and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything for a while - maybe 30 min or so, the color will be there even if I eat. I applied once I finished lunch and then later I had dinner and when I went to brush my teeth I was surprised to see that I still had the color on my lips - the shine of course was gone, but the color did stay! Love it! After I brushed my teeth, I applied a lip balm and it was like I just had applied the Colorburst again! And it did keep my lips smooth and soft. No more chapped lips here!</li>
    <li> A lovely, plummy, &amp;#34;lips but better color.&amp;#34; The color really lasts without feeling drying. It feels like a balm going on and looks glossy when applied. After a few hours the gloss is mostly gone but the stain remains, and still looks good. I bought two of these so I could have one at home and one at work!</li>
    <li> Love this stain gloss, honey is a great color.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, and lasts a long time. I work 12+ hours, and at the end of my shift I usually still have a bit of color left which for me is something that doesn&#x27;t happen with other products. Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this balm stain came right on time..</li>
    <li> Hydrating, pigmented, and even smells nice! After buying this balm stain in Honey (a pinky nude color), I have not been able to stop wearing it. It is the perfect everyday lip balm that adds a nice color and feeling to your lips. I myself would call this one of my holy grail My Lips But Better (MLBB). It has just the right amount of pigmentation to add a bit of color to your lips while still feeling like a balm. It also has a smell that reminds me of a eucalyptus tree. Definitely recommend this for all!</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful after reading the reviews not only on the product, but this particular shade (Honey).  While the lip product went on nicely, there was absolutely NO color to it.  The other reviews said it was the perfect pop of color.  I am serious when I say that there is ZERO color to Honey.  Nothing showed up on my lips.  Might be willing to try a darker shade.</li>
    <li> This color is not what I usually wear but I bought it based on some magazine recommending the brand/color.  At first I didnt use it much, but found that I was using it more and more the longer I have it.  It lasts a good long time on the lip and in in the tube and is a pretty neutral pink that looks good most days and goes with most everything.  It prices out favorably against my favorite lip pencils which are made by Tarte and run $22/each and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This product unfortunately melted in my purse. It wasn&#x27;t left outside, in the car, or anywhere that I felt was extremely warm. It was the only product in my bag that melted. I tried to freeze it to see if it could be fixed but the tip still fell off when I tried to use it. I have 3 stars because I did like the color and lasting ability the few times I did get to use it. Wish it didn&#x27;t melt so easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, but I really like this lip crayon. It lasts quite awhile and it&#x27;s a nice natural color. The only problem I have is that it smells like mint, which I&#x27;m not to fond of. But, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the store where there is no picture of the actual shade, so I was disappointed that the actual balm is much darker than the balm case and sticker. I was under the impression it would be light color, but as you can see from the pic attached, it&#x27;s much darker, although translucent it is a shade of wine.  On the plus side, there is definitely a minty balm therapeutic feel to this when applying. It&#x27;s not waxy or heavy, it&#x27;s light and moisturizing.  Next time I will aim for a much lighter color, I think this amazon page is helpful in showing this product with the lid off vs buying in the store.</li>
    <li> Revlon Just Bitten Kissable Lip Stain/Balm - Honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GORGEOUS COLOR when applied! I&#x27;m pale with light eyes and ashy, dirty blonde hair. -My skin&#x27;s undertones are yellow and pink. This color looks so natural on! I love it!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to purchase this due to a lot of not so great reviews but I&#x27;m so glad I did! Absolutely love the color pay off and the consistency is so smooth and creamy. It&#x27;s not drying at all which seems to be the case with a lot of stain products. The color does stay on for a while on me however the initial glossiness wears off but the color does stay on a fairly good amount of time. It does have a minty smell to it which I love but I know some people aren&#x27;t to fond of. Overall I loved these lip stain and I will be trying other colors here soon.</li>
    <li> Perfect color. So natural. I think this shade would be nice on anyone. Very moisturizing. I&#x27;m on my third one. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this!</li>
