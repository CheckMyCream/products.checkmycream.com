<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s lovely, sturdy and does its job.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. I just wish it was a little taller.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as expected.  Nice weight to it, looks great and does the job.</li>
    <li> Mirror is very nice, HOWEVER, I was searching amazon for a &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; vanity mirror - and used &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; in my search. I should have been more careful reading the descriptions, but I also feel amazon should be more careful in placing similar items in the same searches when they don&#x27;t meet the original wording of the customer&#x27;s search. The rating is for the mirror - NOT for amazon customer support. AND, I&amp;#34;ve had to resubmit this serveral times before it was accepted (???). Probably won&#x27;t waste my time next time.</li>
    <li> Checked out a bunch of these mirrors and decided on this one. Good value. I would definitely buy again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror, just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It is so convenient to have the magnifying mirror and it looks beautiful sitting on my vanity.</li>
    <li> For the price, this mirror provides great magnification!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. For such a great price, she absolutely LOVES it. The height, the extra magnification and the additional weight all make it a favorite for her. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Solid, sturdy, heavyweight, chrome mirror with magnification side. Takes up very little space because round base only about 6&amp;#34; wide.</li>
    <li> Looks great and well weighted so unlikely to get knocked over on the counter.</li>
    <li> This mirror is sturdy and has very little distortion. After getting over the shock of seeing my face magnified 10 times (Not a pleasant sight!), I use it for close work like eyebrow plucking and eyeliner application. It&#x27;s nice to have a 1X magnification on the other side to check how I really look. The mirror is not wobbly or fragile and is a great height for sitting on a table or vanity. It swivels easily and stays put where I tilt it. I have no complaints at all about the mirror. I do have a few about my face that close up but that&#x27;s neither here nor there. :) In all this was a great buy. The price was excellent. I have seen similar mirrors for over $100. I recommend this one if you need or want very high magnification and also like to have a normal mirror on the other side.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this mirror.  It was shipped well and it is quite a substantial mirror.</li>
    <li> Came with small scratch but if you were searching for blackheads you never knew existed this is the mirror for you</li>
    <li> Works well but the edge is sharp a long the mirror. I cut my finger when I picked it up so be careful</li>
    <li> Item is perfect and exactly what I was looking for. Not too big and not too small. Ideal for bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Gave to our Granddaughter and it was just what she wanted.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice looking/simple mirror with great magnification.</li>
    <li> the mirror itself is very good as it looks. the swivel mirror is a little stiff however. also i don&#x27;t use the 10x magnification too much as well because 10x is a little overkill but for its price i got it because i use the normal side often anyway. if you just want to use the normal side or are used to having 10x magnification, this is definitely a product to go</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Just what I needed to put in my contacts every morning. Sturdy too.</li>
    <li> The mirror quality is very nice. I bought it to use with my lighted vanity mirror so I can see my face closer when applying makeup. The &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mirror side seems to have a slight magnification. The 10x magnification side was too strong for me. I had to put my face literally one inch from the surface in order to see anything. I have good eyesight so this was way too much magnification for me. I will have to unfortunately return it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is so warped that the actual viewing area is about one inch, and that is only if I practically touch my face to it.  My cheap little one with suction cups is so much better.  I was very disappointed in this mirror.</li>
    <li> sturdy, heavy solid feel; doesn&#x27;t tip over. good magnification. simple product meets all expectations, attractive, nice to look at too.</li>
    <li> Really nice, lightweight yet doesn&#x27;t tip easily. Clarity good on both sides, including the 10X magnifying side. Mirror adjusts forward and back and stays where you put it. A good decent quality tabletop mirror at a decent price. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> 10X for this size mittor, doesn&#x27;t work good, I was returned ithis item.</li>
    <li> You have to be 2 inches away to see anything in focus on the magnified side. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It does its work. Steady mirror. Although I rarely use the 10X side.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> the 10X side of the mirror was distorted, it looked like a fun  house mirror.  6 inches is probably too small for that much magnification.  Too bad for me.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for putting on my makeup in the morning. It is a little smaller than I was expecting, but it looks really nice and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, useful mirror.  It doesn&#x27;t stand very tall, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the bathroom counter.  You can leave it out without making the bathroom look cluttered.  I wish that it had a light, but you can&#x27;t beat the price!  I definitely recommend this item if you are looking for a nice makeup mirror (or a mirror that you use to pluck the hair out of your face).</li>
    <li> Item is of high quality.  Well packaged, shipped promptly.  I plan to order another for our second bathroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a two-sided standing mirror. It stands solidly on a hard surface. It reflects. It magnifies. That&#x27;s pretty much all one could ask of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the 10x magnification is not for the faint of heart. But if you really need magnification, and if you think you can handle the truth, the truth will be revealed to you in hideously clear detail.</li>
    <li> Very nice vanity mirror for my bathroom.  Looks stylish on my bath counter.  Magnification 10x just right as was the price.  Very happy with purchase and selection.</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic! I bought it to replace a similar mirror which I had for years, but it feel and shattered (and now I am destined to 7 years bad luck!). This mirror is better than the one I had previously. I like this one a lot more. It looks classier and fancier. I can leave it out on a shelf in my bathroom and it looks nice - like it was bought as a decoration! The magnification is wonderful, I use it to apply eyeliner and to tweeze. I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a nice magnified mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for shaping your eyebrows or detailing eye makeup. It is a bit small, so not best for working on your entire face. I like having a magnified mirror to detail my eyes anyway. It works for me!</li>
    <li> This item was a add one xmas present so he really like it and is in the vanity already , seller was great and packaging was fast ,keep it up and overall very pleased !</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mirror to go with my new vanity. The old one I used was lighted but sucked so bad it was only 4 inches and the magnification was blurry and horrible. This one I can actually see. A lot of people think a mirror is a mirror but seriously not all mirrors are created equally. No fuzzyness or blur and the magnificaion side will be great for tweezing. Shows everything. Love this mirror.</li>
    <li> Looks good. Just what I wanted EXCEPT the magnification is too strong for me. 10X is to much. Need 5X or less.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, looks nice on the vanity.  The 10x is clear.  Shipped quickly and packed well to avoid breakage.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Its just the right size to see my whole face on the X1 side, while sitting a reasonable distance from it. The X10 side really amplifies, but you have to be very close. The unit is just the right weight and height, and the image is crystal clear.</li>
    <li> Had to return this item.  Magnification caused it to be too blurry to be used.</li>
    <li> Very attractive &amp; sturdy tabletop mirror. I love its design and light weight. The 10X magnifier most definitely works! In fact, it may magnify too well for my use. The next time I&#x27;m in the market for a tabletop vanity mirror, I&#x27;ll purchase one with half the magnifying power as this one.</li>
    <li> It is slightly smaller than the size of my face. It is sturdy, nice looking and quite heavy(which I like because there is a nice feel to it)</li>
    <li> Functional and exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> it is much smaller than expected!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!! Always wanted one and got one for Mothers day. Use it almost every day! Great quality, fast shipping, and all over awesome.</li>
    <li> These are a very beatiful and well made.  We purchased several for a bridal dressing room.  Excellent value and great decor.</li>
    <li> Love that this has a 10X mirror. Helps with applying makeup!</li>
    <li> I needed this mirror because I wear contacts now and my optometrist advised me to use a tabletop mirror rather than using the bathroom mirror in case my contacts fell in the sink. It serves its purpose. I can see myself very clearly. However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use the 10x mirror on the reverse side because the image is just too blurry for me. Overall, I do like it very much.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Quality at a fair price.  Unfortunately, it also magnifies my wrinkles...lol.  I would recommend this product to anyone needing a great free-standing mirror.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to see all the imperfections!</li>
    <li> This item was ordered when I realized that I truly needed a magnifying mirror.  But first off, it looks great, and has a nice heft to it.&lt;br /&gt;But its best feature is the 8x magnification.  I have great natural light in my bathroom and thought that was enough, but found that the magnification on this product really lets you see up close what&#x27;s going on with your complexion.  Every pore and chin whisker shows up; so you may end up hating it or appreciating it.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> send it back it was awful</li>
    <li> Sturdy and well built.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Perfect for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It is very pretty and the reflections are exact.  I appreciate the 10X power as I am a senior citizen, and it is harder and harder to see my face in a mirror.  No distortions at all.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, pretty and affordable.  The magnification side shows every little pore or eyebrow hair I didn&#x27;t know I had.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for.  Good quality mirror, with a nice, antiqued frame and stand that aren&#x27;t too shiny.  It came well-packed, so it was in perfect shape, right out of the box. I use it every day, and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The mirror is the same one I owned ( it broke), but the old one I had for at least 20 yrs. So I hope this one last as long .  The height is just right for me .  I need the 10x due to very poor eye sight, and this is great for doing my make-up, or twee-zing my eyebrows.  I looked @ a lot of mirrors, but ended up with this one again, because it is so very functional for me. The quality is very good, and it looks nice as well..</li>
    <li> Well-made, accurate magnification.  Mirror swivels but stays where you put it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is adequate but it would be more useful if the stand were higher or adjustable.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase! It is a good quality mirror!</li>
    <li> smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  It is heavy and therefore not prone to be knocked over and the 10x side is fantastic for old eyes.  It is also very attractive.</li>
    <li> I can see now!&lt;br /&gt; I do wish the mirror was just a little bigger</li>
    <li> Magnified view is so blurry as to be not useful.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my vanity. The 10X magnifying mirror may be too much for many. However, I have a wall mounted mirror that is 5X magnification- so I wanted the higher depth for the hand held.</li>
    <li> good quality, great price, and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I like the mirror but it is very stiff to turn and it feels a little distorted in the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; view.</li>
    <li> Great for the price but you must be VERY close to have the magnified side in focus. Without contacts in, i have to be so close that i cannot hold an eyeliner btw me and the mirror. Overall well made but i generally use the non-magnified side</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mirror.  Exact right size and magnification.  One of my best buys ever.</li>
    <li> Great quality and product !!!</li>
    <li> This may be a good mirror overall for the price. It&#x27;s just does not have enough power for me, and I think I would be better off with 15x magnification, but I did not realize it until after purchasing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a decorative mirror that I could set on my vanity and that wasn&#x27;t very expensive. Amazing value, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> great product ..and a good value !!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s what i wanted, a hands free mirror to fix my hair. i had hoped for more magnification,  but that&#x27;s my eyes.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Good quality ！</li>
    <li> Great little vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> The close up side is super intense, but the non-magnified side suits my purpose</li>
    <li> Has been a good little makeup mirror, Pretty sturdy and gives adequate lighting</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mirror.  It is not lighted but I use my own small vanity lamp for lighting. Has a pretty finish, tilts, and I find the magnified side helpful when I want to see all those pores up close. The mirror comes well packed in the box and does have a kind of retro look and feel to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Arrived quickly. Perfect.</li>
    <li> only  problem your web site would  not let me register the product for life guarantee</li>
    <li> aaha, now I see myself really close.</li>
    <li> the mirror was nice my girlfriend liked it meets her makeup needs,and price was good</li>
    <li> Great item. Can really see lots with the 10X! Great seller too!</li>
    <li> The item didn&#x27;t look like the picture when I received it and the mirror was screwed on crooked.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but if I had to do it again, I&#x27;d spring for the lit version and spend a little more because our bathroom is poorly lit!</li>
    <li> This is a awesome mirror. Perfect just what i was looking for 👍 Plus super fast shpping two days arrived</li>
    <li> nice looking and weighty</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmae gift for my 13 yr old daughter so she will stop mirror hopping every morning. 👍 Package received promptly and I opened it to check it out. Seems worthy. Have yet to actually use it... It will be Christmas before it&#x27;s taken out for use.</li>
    <li> A  Very Nice Mirror For The Price, However , When it says Magnifying, It magnifies ! Overall, it&#x27;s a sturdy stand &amp; a good mirror .</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to complete my vanity area, fast shipping, and a great price. I love how sturdy the mirror is and that it is 2 sided.</li>
    <li> 10 times magnification is amazing, good mirror on a stand!</li>
    <li> Perfect to me... People complain that they can&#x27;t see anything from the 10x side... You need to just get close... If you are not close enough you will appear blurry or upside down... The point is to get close. Especially for your brows.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Could be a little bit bigger, 6&amp;#34; may not be enough (yes, I&#x27;m talking about the mirror)</li>
    <li> This mirror will be a great addition to your dresser/vanity space. The normal  side is clear and has good proportion. The magnification side is distorted due to the small size of the mirror, but still useable.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Good mirror, no complaints</li>
    <li> beautiful, stable and elegant, reflects very well!</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  I have a lighted mirror, but I like the way I can carry it to a different table or desk.  I&#x27;d buy it again if I needed to!</li>
    <li> Just right. No cords to worry about.</li>
    <li> I love the 10X magnification for close ups.  It looks great, too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Lightning fast shipping! Exactly as advertised! Great transaction!</li>
    <li> Really nice but 10X is just to much zoom don&#x27;t really use it much but because of that in all fairness it is a beautiful mirror and arrived quickly at a great price its just to intense.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror.  It is a convenient size to sit on my bathroom counter-top and to hold in my hand.  My aging eyes need the super-magnification that it provides &#x3D; it makes a close-up view very clear.</li>
    <li> Quality is quite excellent. However, I ordered the 10x mirror, and that&#x27;s way too powerful, unless you want to look at your pores! I just wanted a shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find the focal point in this mirror, with the image appearing distorted from almost any direction. I have had 10x magnifying mirrors before, but this one seems way out of line.</li>
    <li> I purchased the mirror for my 11 year old grand child. She uses regularly and loves it.</li>
    <li> its ok but wish it was little bigger</li>
    <li> I bought and received exactly what was shown in the picture.  Much better than the mirror I was using before. In hindsight,  I should&#x27;ve bought a lighted mirror because I don&#x27;t always have the greatest lighting, but that was my choice, not theirs on what I bought. So far, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous Mirror! Nicer than the ones I have seen in the store and a great price!</li>
    <li> what a great little mirror!  its a little heavy and thats good i think - its sturdy.  very nice</li>
    <li> Nice enough, but there is distortion on the edges of the magnified side.</li>
    <li> Good quality and value for the very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great quaity, considering the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 for my daughters. They love them. Very sturdy and wonderful quality.&lt;br /&gt;Looks really pretty on their vanities. Would highly recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> This item is as advertised.  Serves as a great make-up mirror.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and wanted.  Base has nice weight and sits firmly on counter.  Recommended item.</li>
    <li> This was a great find! Very well made and pretty. Was packaged securely and arrived quickly. Great seller! A++++</li>
    <li> Good price. Good product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble and I love the sleek simple design. Definitely recommend for the price</li>
    <li> Fantastic mirror for shaving!  Thats why I bought it!</li>
    <li> Mirror was broke when I received it....</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a nice finish and clear image.</li>
    <li> nice mirror for the price!</li>
    <li> Cute vintage looking mirror. Works great!</li>
    <li> Good size, as described and gives Very up close look on the 10x side. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> The 8x magnification is little too much to handle. You need to be really close to not have an inverted view. So, be careful with that.  Otherwise the product is as described. It&#x27;s nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I needed  magnifying mirror to make it easier to apply eyeliner, and this one does the job nicely.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered the mirror in the nickel finish, but I received the chrome mirror, so it will go back.  The style of the mirror was also a little different from what is pictured.  I was really surprised at how little protective packaging was with the mirror, but it arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> Just wanted as lightweight, inexpensive make-up mirror and this delivers.  Mine stays in the cabinet, but it&#x27;s nice enough to set out on your vanity, if you so choose.  Great magnification and excellent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Item came as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in great condition. Very good quality. Magnification is what I needed for a project. Solid build.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror--gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems a bit cheap (the no-slip rubber material on the bottom seems to be coming unstuck) but certainly passable for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice price.  This was a gift and the recipient seemed very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the mirror I have always wanted. It is heavy, not cheap at all. The reviews I read sounded like it may be cheap and that is not the case at all. So glad I took a chance. It is so pretty, I put it in my bathroom downstairs; the bathroom my guests use.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot the entire reason I bought this.. sorry... It is a great mirror. One side is magnified and is perfect to apply your makeup.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really lovely. It is very well made. It looks beautiful on my vanity. You really can&#x27;t beat this for the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent value, appearance, construction and mirror visual clarity.  My wife was very jealous versus her mirror</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. It&#x27;s the perfect size to put on my desk and use when needed. It&#x27;s also very simple and pretty, but has weight to it. One side of it has no magnification and I use that side to put my make-up on. The other side has serious magnification and definitely shows every pore. (which I&#x27;ll admit is slightly terrifying)&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s absolutely what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Great mirror at  an amazing price. Nice size and a beautiful finish.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy. Love the look and size.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I would have liked it but that was my fault, it is still a good product and I love the design and look.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for a clear view while trying to do makeup or anything that requires close vision and no glasses. This is just the greatest for those of us who don&#x27;t have long enough arms any more. Now I can make sure what I am doing with just enough help.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible mirror. The magnifying side is so distorted that you can&#x27;t even look through it. The shape and style is nice, and the regular mirror side is good. If you want a mirror that magnifies, look for one that is 5 times magnification. I found one in a local store with the same shape/style, with 5X magnification. And it is perfect.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Lovely looking mirror. My fault that the magnification is almost too strong.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. I use this for makeup application, and the magnified side for plucking the tiny hairs on my eyebrows that I usually struggle with.</li>
    <li> love the mirror - it arrived on time and is exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Love it! Exactly as described and exactly what I was looking for! Great quality! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price and does its job.</li>
    <li> Fab for shaping eyebrows without having my glasses on. Sturdy design. Kinda scary to see your skin magnified so much.</li>
    <li> Really nice... Sturdy!</li>
    <li> Use this daily for tweezing and makeup. Makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected this to be, no surprises and quick delivery.  Appears sturdy; I&#x27;ve had for a few weeks only, but use it pretty much daily.</li>
    <li> Very nice and amzing quality and received 4 days later</li>
    <li> needed something that was larger and the mirror was light weight</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Sturdy and functions perfect.</li>
    <li> smaller than I had in mind.</li>
    <li> Perfect. My wife loves the 10X magnification and even more so, the stand, which allows her to look directly into the mirror as she puts on &amp;#34;her face.&amp;#34; A good one at that!</li>
    <li> The mirror is nice but when I received it it was cracked. I was not sure of how to contact the seller. I would recommend buy it hopefully this doesn&#x27;t happen often</li>
    <li> It is beautiful and heavy enough to stay standing securely. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  You can see everything clearly.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, heavy &amp; substantial. Arrived on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Just right for makeup  application, and easy to move around, as needed.</li>
    <li> The magnification was too strong so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Good quality, worth the money</li>
    <li> It was a lot smaller than i expected it to be but it gets the job done! I really like the lightweight and size because it doesn&#x27;t take up that much room on my dresser. I though the nickel finish would make it look vintage but it doesn&#x27;t. Either way, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The construction of the mirror is fine. I find though that I have to be within 4 inches of the magnified side for it to work. Probably need a smaller magnification.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Shows me my face like I hoped it would! A very solid product, good weight and good sized mirrors and magnification for my needs.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it as a rear-view mirror to monitor a projection screen behind me while I run PowerPoint.</li>
    <li> A very neat mirror. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks. The 8x magnification on the other side is concave so if your face is not close enough it will appear upside down. The stand, frame, and weight make it feel sturdy.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible mirror.  The mirror kept getting loose from the top, it was impossible to tighten and eventually it fell and broke. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 7-years of bad luck! ;-)</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for when I&#x27;m doing my skincare routine and applying makeup in the morning! It&#x27;s exactly the right size that I was looking for, and you can tell that it&#x27;s a really high-quality mirror when you pick it up, use it, etc. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy mirror - OK if one only wants to use it looking down at it, but awkward to lift up to use the mirror to see the back of the head. Other than that, it works well and is certainly sturdy and pretty.</li>
    <li> I originally posted a less than perfect review of this product because it was missing a screw cap.  I did not intend to return the product because the mirror was otherwise perfect and the missing screw cap did not affect its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the review, I received an email from Deco Brothers Direct requesting clarification of my issue and wishing to rectify the problem.  They confirmed that I had received a defective product and replaced it.  I am very impressed by their commitment to the quality of their products and follow-up service.  Since I was not looking for a refund or replacement, (and I received one without asking for it), the entire experience left me wishing that all companies were as concerned about the quality of their products as Deco Brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this company and commend them for their outstanding attention to detail and customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror! stylish, nice n heavy, good height for table top, quality stuff for professional use.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror for the price. I use this for makeup. The magnification side is excellent for tweezing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Quick delivery.  Love it</li>
    <li> great mirror,good price,but the circumference is a tad small</li>
    <li> Beautiful, sturdy &amp; exactly what I ordered &amp; needed.</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror!! Just what I was looking for. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Not giving it 5 stars, as I would recommend a larger size.  Product is good quality, no complaints at all on that front.</li>
    <li> Great item and super price for his mirror.  FAST shipping as well.</li>
    <li> This mirror has helped me put on make-up better and to see more closely at my skin, eyes, and whatever I need to look at.  The multiplication of 8X is about right for me.  I have glaucoma and it helps me to see things better.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price. The magnifying side is very powerful.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. Just the right size for my vanity table. It was shipped quickly and packed well.</li>
    <li> arrived with broken glass.</li>
    <li> Quality item and i love than it has a little pad under the base to keep from scratching up my glass table top.  My reflection on the normal side mirror does become a little distorted around the edges as i move my face away, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me because i use it mainly for closeup work (like eyeshadow and liner).</li>
    <li> Very nice. Delivery was a little slow.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Heavy base which is nice. Shipped super quick.</li>
    <li> it is good enough and cheaper than in market.</li>
    <li> Very nice tabletop mirror.  The mirror itself is attractive--I appreciate the old-fashioned appearance, and it works well for my purposes.  The magnification side is only focused when you are very close to the mirror, but that&#x27;s exactly when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, pretty, tabletop mirror that functions well.</li>
    <li> Not only was a chrome mirror sent, rather than the nickel finish described, the details of the mirror (the base design) were also different.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror but wish it were a little larger.</li>
    <li> Nicely weighted, good quality. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift and from the feedback it was just right and such a great makeup mirror.  She really appreciated the magnification and the height.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. She was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted and the service was great.</li>
    <li> Have one at home and bought this for Florida condo.  Great price and service.</li>
    <li> Looks a lot nicer than I anticipated. Feels heavy and solid, very good quality. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror.  Ultra convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I already gave a great review!  It is easy to work with, and handle.  It is excellent for make up touch ups.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This looks good and works great.  I like the 8x magnification for doing eye make-up as I can do it without glasses.</li>
    <li> Quality at an affordable cost--I am very pleased with my glasses!  Shipping from Hong Kong is a bit lengthy if you opt for free shipping, but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful little mirror that absolutely serves its purpose, and is an excellent value. The material is metallic, so I am able to adorn it with my favorite magnet.</li>
    <li> This mirror is attractive and meets my needs for magnification when I need to apply make up etc.  It is moderately solid, but a good buy for the price.  I&#x27;&#x27;m hoping the finish wears well.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> very  helpful when inserting contact lenses</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the mirror and the quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Looks good. Priced well and perfect for my purpose; I got it for my guest bedroom so guests can pretty up in private.</li>
    <li> Very well made item at a what I consider a bargain price.  Fast order processing and shipment.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror at a good price.  I recommend this if you don&#x27;t need illumination.</li>
    <li> excellent, i am able to get a good close shave, wont miss any of those hard to get at, blades of hair!!!</li>
    <li> Love my mirror. I can see everything close up now.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!  Good weight in the base and well constructed frame.  The 10x side means I don&#x27;t have to wear my glasses to put on makeup.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> Thank you! I love it! Nice product and fast shipping. I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I come to work with wet hair and no makeup because I love sleeping in as late as possible. I wanted a fairly small makeup mirror for my desk because I got tired of trying to use my compact. The finish is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t show fingerprints. This is perfect. No complaints. :)</li>
    <li> This is a terrible mirror and I need to return it.  I cannot see anything in either mirror and the base is crooked.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice simple. Great fast shipper. Would repurchase from them. Nice part no battery needed easy to take with you</li>
    <li> Great little tabletop mirror for those up close jobs.</li>
    <li> A very sturdy and elegant product for the price.  It does not look like a cheap mirror product.  It&#x27;s actually quite elegant, solid and well made.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  The mirror swivels with a 10x magnification on one side.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Magnifying Mirror  is clear and just the right size. Easy to use &amp; store.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mirror.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.  The mirror is the perfect size, the weighed base is good and solid so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling over and it looks expensive on top of everything else.  Thank you Deco Bros!!!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, stylish, 8x&amp;#34;s magnification is plenty for close up make up application.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, it has a nice classy look.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and so far it&#x27;s still shiny and new.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have trashy cluttered counters when I leave it sitting out because it looks so nice it&#x27;s rather decorative.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very clear.  I use it for shaping my eyebrows &amp; putting on makeup. It&#x27;s magnification is just as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Sturdy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Quick Shipping. As advertised. Thanks! A+</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror for the price. Nice and sturdy. Heavy enough to not tip over</li>
    <li> extremely blurry, might be due to small size of mirror</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Since my bathroom has a strong broadway light system, I have no need for a lighted mirror and this mirror really adds a classy look to my bathroom since the metal matches the metal on my other bathroom elements. Also, the base is heavy so less chance of my randomly knocking this over when I tweeze an extra stubborn eyebrow hair. :) As a Prime customer, I got free shipping that was very fast and I am very pleased with this mirror. Definitely recommend it from both a utilitarian and aesthetic viewpoint.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  I especially love the 10X magnification.  Very helpful.  Looks nice too and is a great size for my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Very well made.  Two sided mirror with 10X magnification on one side.  Packaged securely and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> 10x is too strong of magnification.  Have to get really close to even make out your face.  Hard to tell what the magnification is like by just seeing pictures and reading about it.  Price was good though. Will send back.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror, sturdy and well made. Does exactly what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these as Christmas gifts, and I wish I had order one for myself. I need to! They are very nice quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my mother, she loved it!</li>
    <li> love this! magnification is awesome!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase! Much cheaper than I had found anywhere else and great quality.</li>
    <li> This sits on my chest of drawers and is perfect for seeing what I am doing when changing jewelry, especially earrings and necklaces.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
    <li> I thought it lite up but it does not.</li>
    <li> Great value!  Mirror works well with the two different sides and is stylish.</li>
    <li> The mirror is nice, that is why I gave it 5 stars, but after one day of use, I realize I need a larger size mirror more like 8-9-10 inches wide.</li>
    <li> Great quality, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very heavy &amp; nicely made.  Wish the glass was just a tad bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, 10x side works super for seeing every nook and cranny! Which comes in handy for popping zits!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly, and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own the mirror.</li>
    <li> No frills and portable.  Can use on my bed on a book and does not tip over.</li>
    <li> Well built and very good quality. It has a good weight so it stays put, the images are clear and sharp.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT! WOULD BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Love the product, I use it for changing contact lenses and it works well.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, cheap, tiny, I should have gone to Ultra (local beauty store) theirs is larger, heavier and less money.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MIRROR IT WORKS GREAT AND TH PRICE IS GREAT!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> These mirrors were purchased for a friend for Christmas. We travel together and one item we both like in the hotel is the fancy mirror with an enlarged view. It makes makeup application so much easier and looks better also. Will know soon if the gifts are good choices or not!</li>
    <li> Very nice alternative to a lighted mirror. This was a gift to someone with little counter space &amp; lack of electrical outlet for a lighted version. The magnification, at 10X, more than makes up for the lack of a light. Nice!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. The base is heavy, not cheap. I love this mirror and will buy 2 more for my other bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Is somewhat blurry but doesn&#x27;t prevent me from doing what I need to do.</li>
    <li> Excellent for close up work. Distortion free.</li>
    <li> Solid structure with clear mirrors. Arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my middle daughter.  She just got braces and it makes it SO much easier for her to be sure that she has thoroughly cleaned and brushed!  The construction of the product seems quite durable for her small, shared bathroom with little siblings!  It is small enough to fit on a crowded counter top--and has already withstood a topple or two to the floor.  It works perfectly for her use and--will likely grow with her through makeup and eyebrow grooming over the next several years.  We are happy with the purchase and it certainly serves its purpose well.</li>
    <li> So love this little Goldie locks of mirrors. Good weight won&#x27;t knock over easy and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  Love the 8x mag on other side sometimes the simplest design is the best.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent--just what I wanted.  The diameter gives a great clear view.  The 8X side focus is about 6&amp;#34; and gives great detail.  The satin nickle finish suits any decor.  The frame&#x27;s friction holds the mirror in place.</li>
    <li> Like this mirror. Very attractive.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> very heavy base, but the magnified mirror doesnt appear to be glass, but some kinda hard reflective plastic...with poor quality</li>
    <li> Have to get to close to focus on 8X</li>
    <li> The DecoVros 6-inch two sided mirror was exactly as shown and described and was just what I hoped it would be.  It is well weighted and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I like it. I needed something to do my eyebrows. It was something I needed now because I broke my old one. Not only to do my eyebrows but to do my makeup. It&#x27;s heavy but not that heavy. Just enough to keep it at it&#x27;s  spot. It&#x27;s worth the money, don&#x27;t worry</li>
    <li> Works, reflects just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Seem like a solid product. Nice mirrors with no distortion and lovely finish on the fixture portion. I like it.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a mirror that broke - no complaints. It came fast and was well packed. Really love the mirror.</li>
    <li> Looking for a mirror like this is nearly impossible these days. I finally decided to take advantage of my Prime membership and look for it online. It arrived larger than I expected, with excellent magnification and at a price that was almost a give-away for this item. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This magnified mirror is just the right power (8x) for me to see clearly  when putting on my makeup. It is also great for tweezing brows, makes everything so clear .  I plan on buying another one for my second home.</li>
    <li> bought for daughter to take to college - she loves it! very sturdy. magnifying side is wonderful. great product.</li>
    <li> Everything you would expect - solid, nice quality.</li>
    <li> a little heavy but pretty</li>
    <li> Great. Looks awesome. Works as it should.</li>
    <li> Excellent weighted bottom. Perfect for putting on make-up,etc. while sitting at a table, vanity, etvc.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and perfect for my bath.</li>
    <li> great ,well made mirror, at a great price,we love it</li>
    <li> it liked this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror for the price...good value.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Well made heavier than expected.  I got it for a shaving mirror.  the magnified rear mirror is very nice also, really MAGNIFIED.</li>
    <li> love this mirror! I can now wear eye makeup thanks to this mirror!  The price was reasonable and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting my makeup on and the other side is 10x magnification so if I need to really see my skin close up I can.  It is very pretty and goes well with my dressing table.</li>
    <li> really nice. magnifying side is fantastic, great for make up application.</li>
    <li> Best mirror way underpriced!</li>
    <li> Like it would love it if had a lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> Great product! The only thing I&#x27;d change is a longer or telescopic stand so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend down quite so much. Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice product- very good price. We used these as mirrors for bridemaids in brides room and then gave to them as one of their gifts</li>
    <li> Great product, shipping very slow</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my mother and we did not want a mirror that was lit.  This is nicely weighted and won&#x27;t tip over.  The mirror flips easily and yet sets at the angle wanted.  My mother is pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The mirror serves me well. Was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror I have ever bought.  The magnification is amazing, much better than I thought it would be. Perfect for tweezing un-wwanted hairs from the eyebrows when you&#x27;re in a hurry or between waxes.  It is put together well and arrived nice and snug in styrofoam in its own box.</li>
    <li> Shipped out super fast! Mirror is exactly what I wanted. I need the magnification to put on make-up without my glasses, so this worked out well!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. You can see everything on your face and I mean everything &#x27;</li>
    <li> Love it. Shows me just what I need to see.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly a very good quality mirror. Well made. Looks nice. Great magnification!  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product shipped quickly and was just as described.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. Came broke and the 10x magnifying side was too much.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a countertop mirror that was not well balanced and easy to knock over.  This mirror is very sturdy and looks much more expensive than I paid for it.  Quick delivery. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what u see I love it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Very nice and affordable. Made nice Xmas gift for my teenager</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and at a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s sturdy and looks nice on the bath counter top.  Can&#x27;t find this in any stores for this price - I&#x27;ve searched them all.</li>
    <li> Great price for this functional mirror. Looks great in my bathroom. Very helpful too for my aging eyes.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and needed.  attractive...works well and has nice weighted base which makes it very secure.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my teenage girls and they love it.</li>
    <li> My makeup has been looking so much nicer, especially my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for me, matches the fittings in my bathroom where I have this mirror. I have really enjoyed having this.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for my needs.  Came on time,safely packaged. Thanks</li>
    <li> just like picture  very nice mirror</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she said the magnification is more than she could have expected.  The mirror is well made and on a sturdier base than her previous one that had been knocked over and broken.  It is a high quality mirror.  My daughter had called me when she broke her other mirror rather late at night.  I went immediately to Amazon to order her a new one, thinking it would be 2 business days before delivery.  It was delivered the very next day.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected. Good basic mirror.</li>
    <li> Delivered in perfect condition - a gift for my wife - she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value, well made, packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Good Job!</li>
    <li> I finally found a mirror with the right magnification to aid with eye makeup application. Coordinates with bathroom fixtures and looks stunning.</li>
    <li> good！I really like it！</li>
    <li> Good quality and appearance. 10x is very helpful with tweezing. FYI the 10x side is meant for very close up viewing, the other side for viewing from regular distances.</li>
    <li> Superior product. Perfect for finding those unwanted hairs for tweeting that no one speaks about. :-)</li>
    <li> I can hardly see anything with this mirror. It&#x27;s tooo blurred !</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Looks great and I love the magnified side for doing my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I am new to contact lenses - so the conundrum - you have to see your eye to put them in, until they are in you can&#x27;t see them.  At the optician they have the magnifying mirrors to help you. This may not be the size or quality that they have but it surely meets my needs and, for the price is well made and useful.</li>
    <li> 10X is not very good......too distorted for intended use.....tweezing. Do not like this mirror at all.</li>
    <li> brought this as a Christmas gift for my daughters vanity, it was perfect for what she wanted it for...doing makeup</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for college dorms! I love it so much!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it (it was for her).</li>
    <li> Sturdy.  Mirrors are clear, not at all cheap.  Swivel hold where you want it.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Mirror was broken when I received.</li>
    <li> This mirror is absolutely the best for applying your makeup!  (Once you reach that certain age, if you know what I mean)  The mirror is sturdy and well made. An excellent value!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She is very happy with it.  It is the right size.</li>
