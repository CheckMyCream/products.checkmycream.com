      <li>Cannot ask for more.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>This mascara can get clumpy real quick</li>
      <li>While I love that this mascara makes them incredibly dark, I was really impressed with how full it made them look.  </li>
      <li>This is the best mascara I have used since Max Factor stopped making 10,000 Calorie Mascara a few years ago.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really flare my lashes the way it is advertised to do, but I&#x27;m so impressed with what I&#x27;ve just mentioned that it isn&#x27;t a big deal to me.  </li>
      <li>I  have had many mascaras that tend to clump mostly on the bottem and so far this one does not</li>
      <li>I love Maybelline&#x27;s new Falsies mascara!!  </li>
      <li>It provides clump-free volume, full lashes, and all-day staying power.  </li>
      <li>I usually LOVE this mascara; however the product I was sent; while still in the original packaging, seemed to be old.  </li>
      <li>and I did not even have to wait two full days for my product thanks!</li>
      <li>The mascara is really nice, it is totally washable, but sometimes the mascrara gets in the eye.</li>
      <li>When I first applied this mascara, I thought I had found my new favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>However, it comes off easily with remover, and has a nice, dark color.</li>
      <li>I love the regular Falsies by Maybelline</li>
      <li>Will purchase more, definitely!</li>
      <li>so I look like I have more lashes than I actually do.  </li>
      <li>the first couple hours after I apply it, but I can&#x27;t deal with the flaking.</li>
      <li>Absolutely recommend this one!</li>
      <li>It used to be that my lashes were very full and long</li>
      <li>It makes your lashes look very full and long.</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>Really like Falsies.  </li>
      <li>That shade doesn&#x27;t smear nearly as much.  </li>
      <li>But again, it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Falsies Flared\\&quot; (or at least the one I have</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump but did not make my lashes look false LOL.  </li>
      <li>At first it seemed ok, but after a few uses it started clumping.</li>
      <li>I bought the non waterproof version on special at my local drugstore for $5.</li>
      <li>the regular Falsies, it is ten times better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a perfume scent, which I don&#x27;t think was advertised, and I don&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and makes your eyelashes look so long and lush.  </li>
      <li>Nice mascara, wears well, thick coverage with two coats (definitely needed to comb after first coat to avoid spider leg lashes).</li>
      <li>I thought perhaps I had put more coats on than I could realistically expect to last, so I tried applying less.</li>
      <li>Both versions leave my lashes feeling soft and looking natural.  </li>
      <li>My lashes are blonde (very light), thin, and have medium lenght.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because I love the way this mascara looks during</li>
<li> However, this mascara (probably due to the brush) grabs each lash, separates them, spreads them out, and volumizes them</li>

<li> but I have long thick eyelashes to begin with.</li>

<li> The color is very dark and very matte, and you get a false lash look that won&#x27;t leave you disappointed.</li>
<li> It has a strong terrible odor that you can definitly smell for at least an hour after it is applied</li>
<li> Not only are they very thin, but I have a very slight gap on one of my lashlines where, for some horrible reason, only one or two lashes grow, and when I apply mascara this gap seems emphasized.  </li>
<li> but does not make you look like you have false lashes.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t even comment on the formula because I can&#x27;t get past how bad the brush is.</li>
<li> Even the washable version is a bit difficult to remove completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately, by mid-morning I had mascara flakes all over my cheeks.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not like wearing false lashes, but I still like it!</li>
<li> and I find it impossible to get it to the root without it getting on my lid.</li>
<li> I can handle some clumping but the flaking is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mascara can get clumpy real quick I dont like the curved brushes myself but others may. It does its job for the price you pay and I tried it and now will try another!</li>
    <li> When I first applied this mascara, I thought I had found my new favorite mascara. My lashes had never looked so long! They were as close to false lashes as real lashes can be! No clumps, easy-to-use brush, buildable formula--awesome! Unfortunately, by mid-morning I had mascara flakes all over my cheeks. I thought perhaps I had put more coats on than I could realistically expect to last, so I tried applying less. That didn&#x27;t solve the problem. I end up needing to brush flakes off my face throughout the day. I&#x27;m really disappointed because I love the way this mascara looks during the first couple hours after I apply it, but I can&#x27;t deal with the flaking. I&#x27;ll finish the tube, but I don&#x27;t plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> Really like Falsies.  Gives you the look of long lashes without much effort or fake eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I love the \\&quot;Falsies\\&quot; line. I have not had the experience with flaking, and I feel that even just one coat does a great job making my lashes fuller and look longer. It&#x27;s not like wearing false lashes, but I still like it! I agree with other users that this \\&quot;Falsies Flared\\&quot; is not really different from the regular \\&quot;Falsies.\\&quot; But again, it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Falsies Flared\\&quot; (or at least the one I have) has a scent. It&#x27;s like a perfume scent, which I don&#x27;t think was advertised, and I don&#x27;t particularly like. I have had other \\&quot;Falsies\\&quot; tubes, and they did not have this scent. Has anyone else had this experience?</li>
    <li> Great brand and mascara. Love this mascara to death! Will purchase more, definitely! :) Absolutely recommend this one! I own the Maybelline Falsies (original) too and they are both BOMB.com!</li>
    <li> my daughter ordered this because her cousin Whitney used it on her while we were on vacation.  she had a visa gc so she decided to buy this.  she loves it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so comforting when you find an exceptional and cheap mascara.  This is all I buy.  This beefs up and poofs up my lashes beautifully!  Once I tried a carbon black, but it smeared beneath my eyes.  I use Very Black, the 2nd darkest black shade.  That shade doesn&#x27;t smear nearly as much.  It makes them look feathered back, if you remember that hairstyle from the 80&#x27;s.  Gorgeous lashes-I might not be &amp;#34;born with them&amp;#34;, but I can use Maybelline!</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail of mascara. I always get compliments on my lashes when I have this stuff on. Lengthens, adds volume, no clumps, even kinda has a pleasant smell. Best stuff ever. I will hoard this stuff like a squirrel before winter if they ever discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I like it but I have long thick eyelashes to begin with. Doesn&#x27;t clump but did not make my lashes look false LOL.  Did not bother my allergies like some mascara does.</li>
    <li> I bought these to get the &amp;#34;falsies flared&amp;#34; look and it works okay but does not make you look like you have false lashes.</li>
    <li> It used to be that my lashes were very full and long and I bought any type of eyeshadow.  My lashes have thinned and are shorter.  This product did not thicken or lengthen.</li>
    <li> i am always looking for a miracle mascara that gives me amazing lashes but i refuse to spend a lot of money.  no miracles here.  it is a generic mascara.  you get what you pay for in this case.</li>
    <li> I usually LOVE this mascara; however the product I was sent; while still in the original packaging, seemed to be old.  It was clumpy and smelled a little old.  Maybe some air got in the packaging or something. In short I recommend the mascara, but not from this seller.</li>
    <li> It has a strong terrible odor that you can definitly smell for at least an hour after it is applied</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous mascaras from almost every drugstore brand over the years and I must say this is one of my HGs.  My lashes are blonde (very light), thin, and have medium lenght.  While I love that this mascara makes them incredibly dark, I was really impressed with how full it made them look.  Not only are they very thin, but I have a very slight gap on one of my lashlines where, for some horrible reason, only one or two lashes grow, and when I apply mascara this gap seems emphasized.  However, this mascara (probably due to the brush) grabs each lash, separates them, spreads them out, and volumizes them so I look like I have more lashes than I actually do.  I also notice NO PROBLEMS with clumping, flaking, or smudging, in both the waterproof and washable versions.  This doesn&#x27;t really flare my lashes the way it is advertised to do, but I&#x27;m so impressed with what I&#x27;ve just mentioned that it isn&#x27;t a big deal to me.  Both versions leave my lashes feeling soft and looking natural.  Also, both versions stay on all day--however, it also takes me a little longer to remove it at night, even with makeup remover.  Even the washable version is a bit difficult to remove completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this.  The price is very reasonable and product is great.  It provides clump-free volume, full lashes, and all-day staying power.  The color is very dark and very matte, and you get a false lash look that won&#x27;t leave you disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara and I got it at a good price and I did not even have to wait two full days for my product thanks!</li>
    <li> This mascara isn´t different to others mascaras, the flasies efect is minimum and there isn´t any rason that truly i make me buy it again.</li>
    <li> I  have had many mascaras that tend to clump mostly on the bottem and so far this one does not</li>
    <li> Although the initial effect is similar to the waterproof version, this one ended up smudging and flaking within an hour of application.  Additionally, my lashes did not hold their shape after curling whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It lasts FOREVER. It makes your lashes look very full and long. Cannot ask for more. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps if applied correctly.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews here and elsewhere, I expected to be wowed. Not so much. Nice mascara, wears well, thick coverage with two coats (definitely needed to comb after first coat to avoid spider leg lashes). But a \\&quot;falsies\\&quot; effect was not achieved. And I don&#x27;t see how this mascara will \\&quot;flare\\&quot; the lashes, unless I myself apply yet another coat to the outer lashes and pull them to the side with the brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the non waterproof version on special at my local drugstore for $5. At first it seemed ok, but after a few uses it started clumping.I can handle some clumping but the flaking is terrible. I am constantly swiping my cheeks and checking in mirrors for stray flakes. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.also, no it doesn&#x27;t flare at all. It it&#x27;s heavy and pulls the curl down into a straight, flat lash. However, it comes off easily with remover, and has a nice, dark color.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even comment on the formula because I can&#x27;t get past how bad the brush is. I love the regular Falsies by Maybelline but I will never buy this Flared version again. I have very blonde lashes and I find it impossible to get it to the root without it getting on my lid. Not to mention the stench. I have never noticed a smell with a mascara before, but this one was enough to catch even my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the regular Falsies, it is ten times better.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this to work for me at all. The formula was too wet when applying, so it clumped and smudged everywhere. Once it was dry it made my lashes look very spidery and stuck together, and after a few hours of wear it started flaking in my eyes. I didn&#x27;t like the brush, either.</li>
    <li> i would probably not purchase this again due to it clumping on application.  I wanted to try this because of the reviews, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have used since Max Factor stopped making 10,000 Calorie Mascara a few years ago.  I love Maybelline&#x27;s new Falsies mascara!!  It goes on smooth and makes your eyelashes look so long and lush.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge and I never end up with raccoon eyes mid-day.  By bedtime this mascara is still looking great after all day wear and it removes easily with either soap and water, or a face cleansing wipe.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> The mascara is really nice, it is totally washable, but sometimes the mascrara gets in the eye. Ouch ouch ouch</li>
    <li> Perfect mascara. Loved it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite mascara. I used to wear it on its own, but now I wear it on top of my Covergirl&#x27;s Clumpcrusher. They make a great pair. I recommend that waterproof version. This one I felt started to clump about a month into using it, but the waterproof one never clumps on me. It might not be as clumpy if you pair it with the clumpcrusher underneath. I only started using the clumpcrusher underneath when I started using the waterproof one.</li>
