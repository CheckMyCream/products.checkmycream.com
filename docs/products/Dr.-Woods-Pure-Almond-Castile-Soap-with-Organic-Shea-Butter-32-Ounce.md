<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was awful and promptly returned for a refund.  I used it in the bath tub and it left a thick residue and my skin was very tight and not moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! As a massage therapist, I wash my hands a lot. It&#x27;s difficult to find a soap that will both remove the massage oil and not leave my hands dry and cracked. The castle soap easily cleans the oil off my hands and the shea butter keeps them from drying out better than any moisturizing soap I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t lather like Dr. Bronners Castile soaps.  It might be due to the shea butter.</li>
    <li> No harsh chemicals,  smells good and suds well. Great for babies!</li>
    <li> Despite what so many other reviewers said - I cannot stand the smell of this castile soap. It does not have a rich natural almond smell that people have described. Instead, it smells like cherry cough syrup. I am incredibly disappointed and wish I had spent a few more bucks to get the more well known Dr. B&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and I love the way it makes my skin feel! It lathers wonderfully... whether you use a loofah or washcloth. I don&#x27;t use this one on my face though. I use the regular Castile Black Soap by Dr. Woods.</li>
    <li> This product smells heavenly.  It was just too drying for my skin.  Now I have too much left over, but this scent didn&#x27;t have a smaller bottle</li>
    <li> I love it and it smells great!  I will be ordering again. :)</li>
    <li> I got this because I&#x27;m trying to use only natural products on myself.  My favorite thing about this product is the scent.  It reminds me of black cherry.  I have even using it in a foaming hand soap container mixed with water and it should last a long time.  I tried it as shampoo but it couldn&#x27;t remove the oil from my hair.  It does make a great hand soap and body wash though.  I will continue to explore more uses for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> really like the smell. wish it were a much more emollient product for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for this product. It has no lather to it. And the smell is awful. Everyone said it smelled so good, it DOESN&#x27;T!!</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t like the smell so much the actual soap is amazing on my skin.Before I was using mainstream brands  before I decided to go more natural in health and beauty  and the soaps were stripping the moisture in my skin and hair even the ones that claim to have deep moisture,but not this one I use it one my body and hair and I put some in a old bottle I washed out from my other face wash and used the soap to wash my face every night it removes my makeup without stripping moisture then I finish up by rubbing on jojoba oil.I don&#x27;t think the soap is watery at all for a natural soap I got good lather from it.I think I will try a different smell next time but other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> great soap.  no allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I like more natural soaps but the almond scent was a little off to me, almost artificial in a way, and was kind of watery. May try other scents of this brand to compare.</li>
    <li> am looking forward to using it.  i love it.  will order it again when i need it. definitly wil ll</li>
    <li> Great. Stuff. - all that needs said.</li>
    <li> I use this to make a foaming hand soap for my bathrooms and kitchen.  I like the smell very much and it works well for my purpose.  Not overly drying like some soaps.  Already have and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This soap makes your skin feel like a baby. It softens your skin and allows moisture into your skin. I would recommend this soap to anyone who has dry skin and aging skin.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful!!! It is light and clean and leaves your hands soft. I use it with the Interdesign Foaming Soap Pump sold on Amazon. Only a small amount of soap is required and the rest is water. I double the soap amount (still not much) and you have a wonderful 14 oz in your pump that makes soft foamy soap for hand washing.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other reviews this is a wonderful product. I have very dry skin on top of a very dry winter. My skin has never felt dry after using this and the smell is gentle! Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> I use this for shaving my legs. Just squeeze a tiny bit!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather too thickly but that doesn&#x27;t bother me(and personally I never liked super-lather-y creams.) It leaves skin super smooth and soft afterwards. I love it. I always use a good razor and I haven&#x27;t had any nicks since using this!&lt;br /&gt;I pour a little into my baths and while it doesn&#x27;t form bubbles, it does leave my skin feeling amazing. It&#x27;s great as a body wash too!&lt;br /&gt;This smell(almond) is heavenly! It smells almost tasty. I can&#x27;t stop sniffing it, haha!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it as a shampoo, laundry detergent, or to clean my teeth, so I don&#x27;t know how it works doing those things.&lt;br /&gt;But for what I use it for, it&#x27;s great and I will continue to purchase this from my local health food store!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this soap before, and it works well.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. I have also used it to make baby shampoo and plan to use it to make foaming hand soap.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this enough to order it again.. it barely suds up and seems like any water that touches it POOF its gone. The other castille soaps I&#x27;ve used are much more concentrated and better at cleaning. The smell is good and it does clean but it takes ALOT of the product</li>
    <li> Even hubby loves it.  Smells nice too. Gonna order more Dr Woods bc I love the Shea butter and Dr Bronners doesn&#x27;t have that AND the price is better for this</li>
    <li> I tried using the tea tree castile soap for shampoo and it was horrible and burned. But this is fantastic, my hair is shiny and thick and literally does not have the frizz I used to get from regular shampoo. The caveat is that I have to rinse my hair three times to completely remove the shampoo, but I&#x27;m willing to that since I know I&#x27;m not putting harsh chemicals on my scalp. Would highly recommend this, especially as an alternative to the &#x27;no poo&#x27; revolution, which was too much trouble for me. Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!  It smells like the yummiest, almond cherry sweetness ever, I am super tempted to just eat it.  LOL and the fact that its all natural, vegetarian ingredients makes my earth-mama hippie self very happy &amp; squeaky clean!  My son loves it, and I know it&#x27;s safe to give him, he has very sensitive skin.  I also like that this can be used for general cleaning as well as in the bath, and we can take it camping, use for all our cleanup, and not have phosphates and sodium laureth (sp?) sulfates poisoning the wildlife and ocean!  All in all, great value, huge bottle, smells great eco-friendly &amp; does a fabulous job!!</li>
    <li> Nice smell (not exactly almond-y), but sudsing action is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love natural soap and it is good for when I have visitors staying over my house. I give them this soap in a bottle to shower with verses bath soap.</li>
    <li> I used this product for washing my hair, and it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I love the cherry/almond smell of Dr. Bronners.  I was hoping Dr. Woods would be even better, based on the reviews, at a cost savings.  However, the smell of the soap is sweet like artificial cherry soda, not an earthy, natural smell, in my opinion.  Once you rinse, the afterscent is nothing like the soap, it’s worse.  It smells like wet shampooed carpet – a kind of chemically smell, despite its being all natural.  Note that this is a review for the Shea Butter soap, not the plain.  I am very disappointed in this soap.  I will go back to Dr. Bronners despite its higher cost.</li>
    <li> I love this almond Castile soap. I use it in many ways, but my favorite is foaming hand soap. In an empty foaming hand soap ( bottle must have the pump) add one  Tbsp almond Castile soap. Fill the bottle with hot water and swish to incorporate. The best foaming hand soap. The smell is fabulous, and my hands feel soft. I bought 4 bottles, 3 to give my sisters. I will reorder!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells divine!  I am in love with it!  Nice and thick - foams up really well.  I&#x27;ll be buying Dr. Woods Castille Soap from now on!  Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Soap cleans well, and feels good on my skin. Not much lather but I feel good after a shower with this stuff. No film residue either.</li>
    <li> I love trying new soap, but this burned my eyes so badly. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t use it on my kid. It says it&#x27;s all natural, but it really felt like someone poured bleach into my eyes as I was washing my face.</li>
    <li> I was wanting to find an all natural soap at a good price. This soap was a surprise. I had been using the Dr Bronners castile soap, but found that it dried out my skin so i stopped using it, and switched to this. The quality of this soap amazed me. It lathers extremely well if you use a loofa sponge. The scent fills your shower with a sweet almond scent. It is also a shampoo. And best part, when you are done, there is a nice smoothness to your skin, I did not feel dry skin at all. The after scent that stays on your skin is the Shea butter. Really good quality stuff, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mild and pleasant smell and this bottle last long time.So many uses: clean carpets, make your own hand soap /shampoo/ dish soap.Great and healthy alternative to cleaners /soaps with a lot of harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I picked up this soap the other day as an alternative to the typical shampoo I buy after hearing of the lasting effects of chemicals that are normally used as additives, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap really treats my hair well, and it smells delicious. The sweetness of the almonds really stands out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick this up if you&#x27;re looking for a natural hygiene solution. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> No need to buy seperate body wash, shampoo, laundry soap.  You can use it for everything and your hair comes out &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; clean! Love it.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well minus all the junk that is in other soaps. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This smells AMAZING! I love using this all over my body. I&#x27;ve bought it many times, this is the best price you can find. It&#x27;s usually a few dollars more in stores.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an excellent product, easy to use, soft on the skin, easy to pour into other containers. it&#x27;s also hypo allergenic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m suppose to wash with it or eat the stuff.  This soap smells great!  I liken the smell to something like Amaretto liquor.  If you like that smell, then you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job cleaning! :)</li>
    <li> One of the few products that my husband (who is chock-full of autoimmune diseases, including fibromyalgia and  allergies - to most detergents, especially) can use without incident.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate his eczema and allows it to heal, doesn&#x27;t cause rashes like almost all other soaps, and none of the scents give him migraine.  Hooray for castile soap.</li>
    <li> great item cleans very well for an organic soap. i love the smell and how it makes my skin feel after use.</li>
    <li> I had a family reunion at my house and several of my family members separately told me their skin felt so good after using Dr. Woods.  One of my sisters instantly got on line an ordered it to be delivered to her home when she got there.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I love the smell. The soap is rich and works great for a natural hand soap. It actually soaps up, unlike other castile soaps I have used. The price is better than others I have found.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get that super clean feeling with this product and the smell is horrible. I will definitely go elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Bad smell, it smells cheap and really bad... I am not sure why. Next time I will opt for no aroma.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel &#x27;&#x27;sticky&#x27;&#x27; like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I suffer from extremely sensitive &amp; dry skin. Since using this product the condition &amp; quality of my skin has approved greatly. My skin feels clean, soft &amp; moisturized. Great product &amp; valve. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Would not bathe with anything else.  Castile soap with Shea Butter is superb.  Dr. Woods Pure Almond Castile Soap ks my favorite.</li>
    <li> mild but very good. getting used to it. ordered one more recently.</li>
    <li> In the winter I usually have really dry skin and using this product as a body wash has really helped that.  I don&#x27;t have the chalky dry skin anymore.  I also use it as a shampoo which works great as long as I use a conditioner after to help with the tangles.  I really like the slight almond scent too.</li>
    <li> Between this and the Black Soap, my skin has never felt better!  And this smells so good, you might want to eat it!  The smell does NOT stay with you, only a fresh clean scent.  I am a repeat buyer!</li>
    <li> Love all of the Dr Woods products.</li>
    <li> Personally I think this soap is just as good, if not better, than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s - and a whole lot less expensive.  Love the almond smell with my soap - and it also makes a great shampoo - it&#x27;s not just for hands!  We keep this around the house all the time.</li>
    <li> Good product. Smells awesome</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels great. I use this to shampoo my dog. I don&#x27;t like all the weird stuff in &amp;#34;pet shampoos.&amp;#34; I am also looking forward to using up my pantene so I can switch to washing my newly natural hair with this. I am trying to use products with less ingredients in them.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> Bought to use as hand soap. The smell is a little too much for me, other than that I love it. Next time I&#x27;m going to try a different fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this lightweight oil!</li>
    <li> The lavender smells lovely. I use this on my baby when Johnson&#x27;s was drying her out, her skin is much better now. I plan to get a foam pump and use this myself!</li>
    <li> Best natural soap I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great almond smell! This works really well with a little water in a foam pump!&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going as far as Dr. Bronners soap with other uses. This time it was okay, being less expensive, but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;For now, it&#x27;s really nice &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
