<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They&#x27;re dense but soft, and the price is a steal compared to other brands of equal value.</li>
    <li> I only purchased the flat top kubaki brush and I absolutely love it.  It is perfect for liquid foundation and concealer - blends everything together smoothly.  I do wish that I would have purchased the whole set now.</li>
    <li> Good brushes especially for the price</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. Full flawless coverage!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush so far, it is both dense and soft on the skin; however, I can not give it a 5 star review because I haven&#x27;t had the brush that long and is unable to tell you the long term conditions of the brush!</li>
    <li> Well, I just received this product in the mail and I am very pleased with the service and also the brush itself. The bristles are soft and I can see this as my daily makeup brush.</li>
    <li> I received my brush on time was very pleased with the shipping speed and emails sent to me explaining how to care for my brush its the softest brush ive ever used and so far my favorite in my collection im looking forward to trying the rest in the line</li>
    <li> I bought the flat top kabuki after hearing that it&#x27;s comparable to the Sigma flat top kabuki. After comparing both, they&#x27;re both quite similar. I think the Sigma is a bit denser and the bristles seems a tiny bit shorter. However, for the price of the Beauty Junkees brush and for its quality, it&#x27;s definitely a way better deal. This brush is great at buffing in liquid foundation. It has a nice weight to it and feels great. I also bought the brush holder which is an awesome deal! Hopefully they&#x27;ll come out with eye makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I was in search of a new foundation brush to apply my liquid foundation.  After hearing about these brushes in a youtube video, I decided to give it a try and order the flat top kabuki bursh.  The pricepoint was amazing, other similar brushes cost 2-3 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the brush, I was amazed by how soft it was.  Other brushes I own from high end companies do not feel nearly as soft.  The construction was sturdy and it felt very well made.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out to apply my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon using the brush, I was very impressed with how my foundation applied...it was a dream.  It buffed nicely into my skin and there was absolutely no streaking.  I don&#x27;t feel that it absorbed a lot of my product either, it kept it on my face, and the finished result was a lovely, flawless applicaiton. I haven&#x27;t picked up my beauty blender since I got this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely considering purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Great set of reasonably priced brushes. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them. Very similar to my Sigma ones. These are soft, dense and very well made. Quality exceeded my expectations. Will definitely get the mini ones &amp; the eye makeup brushes next.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent foundation brush</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase ! , the bristle are soft and blend my foundation to perfection. They are very good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. A perfect selection of brushes. I have used each one and they are very well made. Soft and densely compacted bristles. The kicker is that they come in a travel case that rivals a high end case for a camera lens. Pretty cool. Definitely one of my better purchases.</li>
    <li> Very soft good quality</li>
    <li> I love the flat kabuki brush and the rounded powder brush. Over all very good brushes sturdy and soft. Will make your make up look flawless.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Full. Soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say they come smelling like harsh chemicals so make sure to wash them out well before your first use. After washing the scent went away pretty much immediately.</li>
    <li> The bristles are really soft, and the packaging is really convenient. I travel quite a lot, and usually I&#x27;m always thinking about how I am going to put the brushes so that it does not get trampled inside the luggage. However, it was the best decision for me to get this set.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Makeup application is flawless. Surprisingly good quality for the price. Super satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Soft, blends well.  Might be ordering this same style brush in a smaller size for concealer.  Also, great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They are very well made, big enough to do the job and the case even has a snap closure to keep the lid from coming off.  They arrived quickly and the company has offered advice on how to use them.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes, they&#x27;re thick and good quality bristles. Very soft.</li>
    <li> Ideal para aplicar maquillaje fluido.</li>
    <li> Luxurious brushes at such a great deal!</li>
    <li> I ordered the angled brush and I Love it! I was looking for one that would help me contour my face and this does a perfect job. The brush is soft and thick and just what I was looking for. The makeup brushes that I have been using fall apart. I am so glad I came across this brush!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush; great quality, easy to use, and so versatile. Love it!</li>
    <li> Sooo soft and good quality! Puts on my makeup super quick too!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my new brush! It does not shed and is very soft. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I love it already! Thanks to saaammage on yt for recomending it!!</li>
    <li> I love those brush set. They are so beautiful and awesome quality. Highly recommend! I&#x27;m a professional make up artist  and I would say those brush are very dense and soft as good as the Sigma kabuki. The price is very reasonable or way cheaper than MAC or Sigma but same quality. Love my brush set very much. Their service is wonderful as well. They followed up my order and sent me email to confirm the shipping and email to show me how to keep my brushes in good condition. Very professional! They sent me brush gloves sample pack and a mini round kabuki to make it up for delay shipping. I didn&#x27;t expect that but that happened. I will buy more products from this business in the future and recommend all my friends about them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The packaging is amazing !! The quality of the brush is better than no other. I am so pleased with my order!!!</li>
    <li> I write this after using the kabuki brush only 2 times. I&#x27;m being nudged by the company to leave Feedback so here goes: my first impression is that the brush is very soft but there are enough bristles for it to be firm while pressing down to buff the foundation. The finish is lovely without working it too hard. Cleans easily and dries quickly. So far I am more than satisfied as it compares nicely to my MAC and Stila brushes. If anything changes, I will update my review and rating. Thanx to Beauty Junkees for making these tools available at such a good value!!</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amazing brushes!!  I was surprised these are such great quality!</li>
    <li> brushes are so soft love them!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes- excellent coverage and very similar to sigma! Love love love- a must buy! This will step up your makeup game.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good makeup brush for quite some time now and had almost settled on one from another brand that had eave reviews, but then I saw this set and thought I&#x27;d take a chance since I would be getting way more for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received them today and I&#x27;m very impressed with them. I tried a few of them out and the application was wonderful. The brushes are dense, yet super soft and buff the makeup onto your skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give them a wash right away to see how they held up and I&#x27;m very impressed, not a single hair lost. You do have to be careful that you don&#x27;t use too much brush cleanser or you&#x27;ll be rinsing forever, but other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder for the brushes is a nice touch and a great way to pack them away if you&#x27;re traveling since it&#x27;s sturdy enough to keep them from getting crushed.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find a foundation tool better than the Beauty Blender sponge and I never ever would&#x27;ve guessed it&#x27;d turn out to be a brush. But here I am writing this review. I absolutely loved the finish I got from the flat kabuki brush. It was flawless, seamless, and uses way less product than a sponge. The brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t scratch at all. It also takes less time to apply than the sponge. One of the main reasons I stopped using a foundation brush is because it seemed to highlight all my flaky dry skin in the winter and make them way more noticeable. Surprisingly this brush didn&#x27;t do that! So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> These are without a doubt the best brushes. They have dense fibers that perform well in creating a flawless look. I appreciate the thoughtful design with the regular and mini brushes.The brush holder is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> Brush is very soft and semi-dense. Not as dense as the Sigma F80 but gets the job done. I only ordered the flat top not the whole set so can&#x27;t comment on the other brushes but I assume they are probably the same as the flat top kabuki.</li>
    <li> Amazing product definitely recommend this as a stocking stuffer! Love it! Great for holiday travels as well!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous brushes and very nice brush case they came in. Highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great, soft, plush and lovely brush (this is for the flat top - amazon bunches them altogether)!  Feels amazing on your skin and the makeup goes on very evenly, at least from my first few uses.  I am not a makeup junkee, and I have NO idea how to wear foundation.  I never heard of primer until a month ago when I had my first makeup trial ever in my life because I&#x27;m getting married in a few months.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, and when I go out it&#x27;s usually just some eye makeup.  Needless to say, I bought this brush to use some of the MAC &amp; Sephora foundation and primer samples they gave me so I could get used to wearing a full face of makeup for a whole day.  It was so popular on Amazon so I gave it a try and it&#x27;s wonderful!  I would buy it again and recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The flat kabuki brush has a nice feel to it. Soft bristles and balanced handle. Does not irritate sensitive skin. Beautyjunkees package has detailed instructions for cleaning and care.</li>
    <li> Have started using the foundation brush and quality is great.  Have never been happy with foundation brushes before using this one.</li>
    <li> Best brush i have ever used !!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great--high quality for a fraction of the price!! Shipping is fast too!!They compete with high end brushes from bigger, known companies! Will definitely try their other brushes. Give these a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have little hairs left on my face after applying my foundation. This brush is so soft and offers even coverage. As good or better than the $30+ Clinique brush.</li>
    <li> Saw a review for this on Youtube and decided to try it. I am sooo happy that I made the purchase. I am going to get the eyeshadow brushes next. These are very high quality and they apply product beautifully. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Like it best after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Works and feels great with no shedding! Love this brush!</li>
    <li> I bought the flat kabuki to use with my Kat Von D Lock-It Tattoo Foundation &amp; love them both! Flawless skin now! A make-up tutorial on youtube lead me to do this. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Received it as a Xmas gift. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but came well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Washed the brushes as recommended, and kept its shape well. Looking forward to using the flat brush for liquid foundation!&lt;br /&gt;Will update once I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> comparable to the sigma brushes for the fraction of the price! amazing quality and portable with case!</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time, the service from this seller is phenomenal, they keep sending me emails to ensure my order was on time and cleaning instructions for the brush.. I was very pleased with that.. Ok, now abt the brush itself, I was tat bit disappointed with the size of it, it a big small I think the handle is a bit short an inch more would have made a difference I think.. The Brissles are very firm but soft, it leaves NO lines when I apply my foundation, which Is great for me...I think this brush should be called THE AIRBRUSH BRUSH.. As it gives that airbrush flawless application finished. Because of the sellers professionalism I give it 5</li>
    <li> It was sent to me on time and it was fast! And shipped out to me in Hawaii. The brush is so soft though, even after washing it. But the greatest part is that it blends my foundation flawlessly, tried other brushes and my hands nothing compares to this brush! Thanks to Saaammage for the $5 off as well. I love my new brush, want to get more of them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing. They are so soft, and came to me in great packaging. I have no complaints with these brushes, and will be ordering again soon. These brushes are way softer than my sigma kabuki brushes and the right amount of density. Also, the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  They don&#x27;t shed and they are comparable to the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Very soft,easy to clean and  swift delivery</li>
    <li> I just received my order this morning &amp; I&#x27;m still reeling from the excitement! I first heard about Beauty Junkees thru a few of my favorite YouTube vloggers. Needless to say I was intrigued. High quality brushes that are actually affordable seemed so foreign to me &amp; I just had to check them out for myself. Once I saw them on Amazon, read many of the incredible 5 star reviews &amp; then saw the prices, I ordered all 3 sets immediately. Even tho I chose the free shipping option I received my order in record time (on a Sunday morning, no less!). I ripped that box open like a kid on Christmas morning (I&#x27;m a sucker for some good brushes!)! The 1st set I dug into was this set of the 5 large face buffing brushes with the brush cylinder. All I can say is HOLY S***!!! THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING!!! They are soooo soft but dense enough to apply product flawlessly. I double checked each brush for any shedding - no shedding! I also checked the ferrules to make sure that they&#x27;re not loose or damaged in any way - they&#x27;re on there snug as a bug in a rug! I have many different brands of brushes &amp; I think I&#x27;m pretty knowledgeable when it comes to spotting brushes that are high in quality &amp; in my opinion these brushes are the bees knees 🐝! Beauty Junkees brushes are what other brushes wanna be when they grow up!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and feel like the professional brushes that are way more expensive.  I love the case that comes with it! The shipping was fast just as promised by the seller.  Great product</li>
    <li> I just received my set, the case is so much bigger than I expected! I already have a flat kabuki brush that I absolutely love, so I couldn&#x27;t pass up this this great deal! Can&#x27;t wait to try them all out.</li>
    <li> Amazing seller! Awesome quality and price on brushes and quick shipping :) will def keep buying from.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes, although I mistakenly thought they would be bigger.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am surprised beyond belief on these brushes. I got them yesterday and the brushes were soft and great quality. I&#x27;m a makeup guru so I make sure what I buy are great quality and I am impressed by how they feel. They actually do feel like the expensive brushes at sephora or ulta. Getting them made MW want to put makeup on and they are great! Smooth application and each brush does what they are suppose to do and the case is awesome. 2 thumbs up and totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> Just used these brushes for the first time and they are awesome.  Just as good as my Sigma brushes but these are less expensive. I was skeptical about making a purchase but now I&#x27;m glad I did. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better quality for the price. Will purchase again in the future!!</li>
    <li> Hi. I&#x27;ve had the Crown badger brush set for a few years. I purchased it after the many rave reviews on YouTube. I&#x27;ve never been happy with them. They shed everywhere and are not as soft as I expected them to be.  I quit using most of the face brushes and went back to my hands for foundation and any creme product application. I decided to try brushes again after switching to Smashbox&#x27;s Studio Skin foundation which is amazing!!!!!  I actually came back to order the popular sigma flat top kabuki and noticed this one had a ridiculously high rating. Went back to youtube and every vlogger confirmed that it&#x27;s awesome. One of videos had a promo code so I decided to try it out. I used the flat top for my foundation, angled for my blush, and tapered for my under eye concealer today for my application and I got a lovely finish. It buffed and mixed my makeup very nicely and even though I used a light hand it felt worked into my skin. They were easy and intuitive to use. I only needed the 1 pump of foundation I typically use and I was ready. I recommend these because they are cost effective, feel good on the skin, and are very good quality.</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft and it&#x27;s excellent</li>
    <li> Lovely brushes.  The case has a serious (unpleasant) odor, though.  I hope it wears off!</li>
    <li> I really really like this brush, no hair coming off to my face (which I hate the most), I clean it every 2 weeks, it still remain it shape, I like it so&lt;br /&gt;much I brought 3 of them.</li>
    <li> I love the Flat Top brush, so affordable and great application with foundation! The bristles are soft and sturdy, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus! Overall, I love it and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Works great, I have been using it every day. Blends may liquid make up evenly. I have washed it as you recommended, never submerge in water, use mild liquid soap and softly rubbed in the palm of your hands. Let air dry.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Works just as described!!</li>
    <li> Super, super soft brush, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I like to use a powder foundation and the flat brush is so easy to use to apply a nice smooth base. I also love the flat angled and the angled for applying blush and a contour blush. Definitely beats my old traditional brushes.</li>
    <li> Very high quality brush distributes foundation far better than foam pads.</li>
    <li> I ordered the rounded makeup brush.  It is awesome - some are so wimpy but this is nice and firm just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I will order again😄</li>
    <li> Ordered the Kabuki Blush Brush Angled, LOVE it, and LOVE the service and tips from Beauty Junkee&#x27;s.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it made a huge difference on my face. After using this brush, my face looked flawless which is a big thumbs up. I would definately recommend this brush. LUV the price!</li>
    <li> Just got it today, already obsessed :)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied!! My new favorite brush</li>
    <li> These brushes work great and are a great value for the money! I am planing on ordering the brushes for eyes!</li>
    <li> I have the tapered kabuki brush and so far I love it. It is very soft and it still thick enough to do a great job. About the appearance, the brush looks expensive and high quality, no loose parts, all the bristles in the right place and comes in a good package. The unique reason for don&#x27;t give it five stars is that I received it recently and didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to use it many times, so I did not do a real cleaning yet and can not say how it will be after that</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful, and very well made!!  The holder is also such a neat idea, makes for easy travel!!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes at an awesome price. I was searching for the Kabuki Flat Top brush and decided to try the 5 piece set and have found use for all of the brushes. The holder was an awesome plus and I use both the top and bottom as separate holders. The brushes are soft on the skin and have some weight to them, they are not flimsy or cheap feeling. Great investment.</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes. So soft and sturdy. Will be buying as gifts for family members.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I originally ordered the angled kabuki to try it out because of the hype.  I used my finger before and OMG, never again will I EVER use my finger! These brushes are amazing &amp; it does not absorb the foundation.  I blot the foundation all over my face &amp; then use the kabuki brush in small circles or blotting it all over my face.  I have been bragging at work to co-workers, my bunco group...basically every female or make wearing person I can.  You will not go wrong with these brushes.  I have washed my angled brush a couple of times &amp; no shedding &amp; yes, I wash my brushes  with olive oil &amp; dawn.....ABSOLUTELY HAPPY WITH MY BEAUTY JUNKEE  BRUSH SET!!!</li>
    <li> posting for my wife.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these brushes, but my old ones were getting raggedy and this seemed like a good value, so I decided to try them. In a word, these are the nicest brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought. There is a shape for every possible application. They have no stray hairs, apply makeup perfectly, clean easily and look fabulous on my makeup counter. I would definitely buy these again or give as a gift.</li>
    <li> arrived fast and a quality brush! loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy... okay phew! just getting that out of the way.  That being said, I am getting into makeup, but with the intent of it not being noticeable! Therefore, I believe that it&#x27;s imperative to have good tools to accomplish concealing, bronzing, contouring, etc that looks natural! Just got this brush set in the mail, and right out of the package, these look and feel like quality brushes.  I was looking for a quality brush for powder application, and the round kabuki was one of the top search results.  When I saw that the whole set was only $39, I decided to go for the whole set! I bought ONE brush from sephora for that price!  One of the first things I noticed though, is that the bristles are shorter than I expected on the round kabuki (although it clearly looks the same on the picture).  I still like the round brush i got from sephora with the long bristles because it&#x27;s easier to cover the whole face quicker.  However, I&#x27;m still new to makeup, and I&#x27;m thinking these brushes are going to make it easier to be more precise, and even, giving a more flawless appearance.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.  Considering price, quality, performance, and the great customer service, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> these are high quality brushes. I love it. It has a bad weird chemical smell at first, but I just let it air out overnight and it&#x27;s all good. This is an amazing brush set for applying foundation, blush, contour, blending concealer.... I&#x27;m considering buying the smaller mini set for under eye concealer and other smaller area that these big brushes can&#x27;t get to.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have ordered tons of make up brushes in the past and these don&#x27;t even compare to any of them! They are the softest, nicest brushes I have ever purchased. I ordered the kit with 5 brushes and the carrying dispenser. When they arrived, from the moment I opened the package, I was impressed! I only wish there were more sizes that I could do my eye makeup with!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles -- great coverage!  Worth the price -- will buy again.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with these brushes! Quality is top notch and saves me a lot of money since I no longer have my eye on Sigma brushes. Love the case too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to all this makeup stuff and I knew I needed one of these brushes for my makeup. I am glad I found this flat kabuki brush! Very soft! And blends my makeup well. I love it</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! I haven&#x27;t been able to use all of them but the flat kabuki is amazing. I had given up on brushes and use beauty blender. As I was looking into buying new Clinique foundation I YouTube video where they used these brushes. I loved the way it was applying so I was I sold! And instead of purchasing just the flat kabuki I purchased entire set! All I can say is very good quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are lovely and I am very pleased that I bought the set instead of just a brush or two. The brushes feel sturdy and the bristles are very soft. They pick up and distribute just the right amount of product, and the price is great for the value! I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> I bought the foundation kabuki brush. I really like it so far. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of high end brushes- sigma, It cosmetics, Tarte etc. The flat top kabuki is as good and soft as these brushes and a lot cheaper. It does not poke my face, which is very important for me. I will keep this for my gym set. Planning to buy the whole set.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! The bristles are soft and feel so delicate on the skin. I was hesitant to trade my regular foundation brush for the flat kabuki, but i have to admit that I am so glad I did. It blends the foundation into your skin so beautifully!</li>
    <li> Wow finally I found  a Brush set that is great and cheap at the same. I will recommend these and i did to my friends Definitely not a waste of money</li>
    <li> These are some of the nicest brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I have several Sigma face kabuki (&amp; eyeshadow) brushes and I cannot tell the difference when it comes to blending the product on my face between the two brands. Both do an excellent job but once you consider the price, it&#x27;s a no brainer to buy these. I ordered another set as I like to use the brushes 2-3 times only and clean them once every week - 10 days so I need a few spares. I also ordered 2 sets of their eyeshadow brushes... again, I&#x27;m just lazy about washing them frequently and prefer to have spares. I totally recommend these brushes by Beauty Junkees. Amazing price for the quality. Some youtubers have one time discount codes you can apply so you can save a little bit of money. Since the codes are one-time only, I recommend you decide in advance all the products (go to Amazon&#x27;s Beauty Junkee store) and how many of each you want before you place your order. If I would have known they were this nice the first time I used discount code, I would have ordered more and saved money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I want with the choice of ordering these. The brushes does an amazing job. I do plan on making a YouTube video review on this product. Please look out for it  beautybyleela</li>
    <li> great brush-highly recommend. great service</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes!  Makeup adheres to bristles and applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING. I love how soft they are, and they feel and work just like the insanely expensive ones I have used in the past. I bought the five piece set, which is great because I can try different types of brushes without breaking the bank. The bristles are nice and even, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding yet, which is a minor miracle because I am a little rough on my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The secret star of this purchase is the case though. I love it. It is much bigger than I was expecting, very sturdy, will hold more than just these five brushes, and will be perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT purchase.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful set of large kabuki brushes for an outstanding price! I am fairly new to wearing much makeup and needed to add larger brushes to my brush collection. These are a great choice. While I am enjoying using the brushes and experimenting with them, I love the travel case almost as much. I actually use each half opened, one with the brushes that came in the set and one with my other brushes. I hope to add the eye brushes to my collection at some point in the future. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with the brush it soft it so easy to apply I really want more</li>
    <li> I was looking only for a new blush brush, but I was so impressed with the reviews for these brushes that I ended up getting the full 5-piece Kabuki set and the full 8-piece eye makeup brush set! I decided that finding brushes this good at a reasonable price point warranted getting rid of all my old and not-so-great brushes and starting fresh with a great matching set. I am so happy with my purchases... the brushes exceed my expectations. They are sturdy, full and soft, with a perfectly balanced feel in your hand. The quality is top notch. That goes for the cases too for both sets - unbelievably well-made! I cannot believe brushes this good are this reasonable, and I&#x27;m so happy I found Beauty Junkee.</li>
    <li> High quali6ty brushes and fast delivery.  You need these.</li>
    <li> Previously I purchased [[ASIN:B00LBD65TA Kabuki Makeup Brush Set with BONUS Travel Brush Holder: Includes Foundation, Blush, Bronzer, Concealer, &amp; Mineral Brushes]]. I liked them so much I purchased a second blender and most recently I purchased this tapered brush which I absolutely love for under the eyes.Foundation goes on smoothly and gets into all the nooks and crannies you cannot get with the flat blender brush.</li>
    <li> The brush I ordered arrived earlier than expected. The packaging was great and very professional looking. The product was very soft and of a much higher quality than other brands I have ordered online. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Just bought this for my girlfriend and she is loving it. She actually regrets buying other similar products instead of these ones and now she wants to buy the complete set.</li>
    <li> Got my brush earlier than I thought which is awesome! So soft and works great!</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  May get a set for myself.</li>
    <li> after days researching face brushes, I decided to get sigma brush but when I went on Amazon to purchase it, I came across Beauty Junkees brushes. I was amazed of how many great reviews they had. I even watched YouTube videos on them. I decided to buy Beauty Junkees face brush set,  wow I was amazed how soft they were n how well they worked. Love how my makeup looked, very smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave cakey look. I just got them a week ago n they great. Love them, love the price. Fast shipping too.... Will purchase more.  -jessica</li>
    <li> Love this brush so soft</li>
    <li> Very soft on the face and no shedding yet after a month of use. Great deal. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The brush is really good! It&#x27;s definitely comparable to Sigma or other high end brushes. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of these brushes.  They all work as expected.  I use the flat kabuki with my mineral foundation.  It&#x27;s better than the brush that came with the foundation.  I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Got the kabuki brush to use with my bare minerals powder and it is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t shed hairs. Super soft. Great coverage. Bought a second one shortly after the first to keep in the office. Will definitely be purchasing more brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the brush more than my high end one. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> They really are as good as they are cracked up to be... period.  My application is perfect... just using one time the flat top kabuki for RMS beauty cream foundation and the angled brush for concealer (also RMS beauty), i can see a huge and welcome difference... flawless results.  Next i must have a brush for highlighting with the lip to cheek color  ... i use &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; (yes, also from RMS( for rose marie swift, makeup deva)... brushes are great... so much better than sponges, yechhhh!, or brutally dragging your fingertips over your beautiful skin... Buy the brushes... better get more than one size... you will find a way to use it...  thank you texas kabuki synthetic makeup brush beauty  junkees... makes makeup fun everyday...</li>
    <li> I purchased the round and the angled kabuki brushes and they&#x27;re great but I personally feel like they werent as dense as i would have liked. I have a set that were 12.99 on here and they are a bit more dense. Idk maybe they&#x27;ll get better with use. Otherwise, they are very professional and neat looking and with a weighted ferrule. Overall i&#x27;m in the middle with these. I say try it out.</li>
    <li> I bought the flat kabuki and I fell in love with it. It so soft and shed free. I would would buy another brush from the line. It&#x27;s much cheaper and affordable than the Sigma brushes. The reason I gave it a four is because it had this strong scent when I took it out of the package.</li>
    <li> Never got the free travel brush with it, But I love my actual brush I got!!!</li>
    <li> The round brush is so soft and blends my makeup perfectly, all for a great price</li>
    <li> Very soft brush... good quality.  No falling out hairs.</li>
    <li> Received the brushes promptly. Great application, affordable, and you will not regret your investment.</li>
    <li> Received the product just as promised, good price and fast shipping. Love the tips too! I would certainly purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever bought!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I will never apply foundation again with my hands after using this brush. Beauty junkees awesome delivery time. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very soft and thick...wonderful for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes.  When I can I will be buying more. They are worth it and the customer service is nice. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> These are great makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> Great brush set. Comparable to Mac brushes but way nicer of a price.</li>
    <li> trying to find dupes for high end brands is never easy but these brushes are amazing and super affordable. on your first purchase, you get half off your order so you can splurge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely a must have to use for your everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am more than happy.</li>
    <li> Well made. Soft (not as soft as the sedona lace midnight collection kabuki I have BUT it is still really soft) . Dense. Does the job at an affordable price. I bought the round top kabuki and I love it . blends foundation out really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made quality product at an affordable price .</li>
    <li> I finally had a chance to use my new brushes today. I think they are great. I&#x27;m so happy that I decided to order them. If I have need for anything else I will definitely do business with Beauty Junkees!  I recommend these brushes highly.</li>
    <li> Foundation looks so much better when using this brush! Try it, u will love it too!</li>
    <li> I just received my order &amp; am soo unbelievably impressed with the quality of these brushes!!  I received them super fast and these are simply amazing &amp; are hands my new faves!!  The price &amp; quality cannot be beat..plus you can also find coupon codes online.  These brushes will no doubt retire you Sigma ones.  My only regret is not knowing about this company sooner.  Will be ordering a second set &amp; the fact both sets come with REALLY nice quality cases is an added bonus.  These cases are awesome.  Great job Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> Very !!! Fast shipping, and good brushes</li>
    <li> This brush was bigger than I originally thought, but that is not a bad thing.  It is very luxe, I purchased it for use with concealer, it is very soft and does a great job for what I need it to do.  I do recommend the brush highly for purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. It is so soft. Works wonders. I would highly recommend it!!!! So worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the BPro Flat Definer Brush, this is exactly the brush I was looking for when looking for this particular type of brush, you can tell the quality is above par and this is a very well made tool. The brush deposits just the right amount needed for product and truly delivers for it&#x27;s intended purpose, the bristles are high quality and for the price,it was a very good find. Will definitely look into other BPro brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> Beauty Junkees makes the best flat top kabuki brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I bought the Sigma F80 the first time around and it ended up falling apart within 3 weeks. I was super bummed but I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on a new expensive one, so I simply searched &amp;#34;flat top kabuki&amp;#34; on Amazon and found my new holy grail brush! it blends nicely, doesn&#x27;t steal my product, and the biggest thing for me: it&#x27;s durable. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very full and soft brushes.  Compares well to my MAC brushes.  LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The cases they come in are great. I can even fit my makeup in along side. I can&#x27;t imagine how they could be any better.</li>
    <li> Almost a month into having these brushes and they&#x27;re great! I use them for all types of liquid foundation brands (UB Naked, BareMinerals Bare Skin, Chanel velvet lumiere, you name it!) The brushes are soft and buffing/blending the foundation in is super easy with these guys!</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Love it</li>
    <li> Great quick service &amp; product!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! So soft!! Haven&#x27;t tried them all yet but love them so far. The case they come in a perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my new makeup brushes, and at a cost you just can&#x27;t beat. They&#x27;re so soft and awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush. I was looking for a replacement for my Sigma F80 that had come apart a few months ago. I had been noticing around the YouTube community that some beauty gurus were having problems with Sigma brushes not being as good quality as they used to be. I had to agree since my F80 failed after only 2 years. Sad since my $3.00 ELF brushes are still going strong! One of the girls I watch Kristin Gehm, really enjoyed these so I thought I would give one a try. I must say I was really pleased. The brush is as soft as the F80, with one difference, it&#x27;s not as densely packed. I actually like this feature better then a more dense brush because it seems to be a little more forgiving on your product and buffs more gently. This also makes it good for buffing and stippling. I used to use the F80 to apply and then a separate stipple brush. It cleans easily as well. It&#x27;s an all around good brush and I think I&#x27;ll try a few more. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> First time to use a brush to apply liquid make up.  Love it.  Very soft and applied makeup beautifully and evenly.  A keeper for sure.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush set so far! I only got to use these brushes briefly this morning for the first time, but I was in such a rush. However, in that time, they worked fantastic. The bristles are strong and well put together but yet soft on the face. The cup it comes in is surprisingly great quality as well, I was expecting a cheap holder. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite foundation brush!  Much better than my other brushes which were 4-5 times more expensive.  Bristles are firm enough to buff without streaks or brush marks yet the bristle tips are so soft and silky and pick up just enough foundation.  I love this brush and plan to purchase more!</li>
    <li> OMG Holy Grail for make-up!&lt;br /&gt;I love those brushes. The quality is amazing.</li>
    <li> great set of brushes, very fast shipping  quality product</li>
    <li> I held off writing my review until I could use and clean each brush over a period of several months....five to be exact.  My assessment is the Kabuki Brush Set by Beauty Junkees is the perfect example of what makeup brushes should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes can be used with every type of foundation from liquid to mineral as well as buffing out under eye cover/brightner and applying blush and finishing powder.  I have washed them repeatedly over the last five months.  After use, I swirl the brushes into a Neutrogena makeup remover wipe.  About every ten to fourteen days I do a thorough cleaning.  A good dollop of  Dawn dish washing liquid in a shallow dish of warm water, then dip and vigorously swirl each brush into the soapy water and again into the palm of my hand.  Rinse thoroughly and shake off excess water.  I use a clean towel to mold the brush back into shape and place upright overnight to dry, To date, not one brush has lost a hair and they remain as soft and sturdy as the day I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees have nailed softness, versatility and durability in the world of makeup application brushes.  In addition, the cylindrical travel case is extremely sturdy and is the perfect accessory for storing and carrying your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience with this set of Kabuki brushes, kudos to Beauty Junkees for producing quality products at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> The Quality of the brushes are AWESOME!! I LOVE the brushes. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them. The shipping was super fast. They are so soft and make blending makeup a breeze</li>
    <li> I actually saw multiple reviews of this on youtube before purchasing and was very excited to try this kabuki set out. I absolutely love these brushes! They are totally worth the price. Get them now they are a steal in my opinion.  update: I really love this set and have had it for a month and now the brushes have started the shed after washing they just as directed. I am really disappointed because they were my favorite until they started shedding.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, lovely brushes! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many makeup brushes before and these are by far the best ones yet. The bristles are very soft and they are very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I saw these brushes on a makeup tutorial and the girl on the video was saying how they were a great deal for the price and quality.  I just got them 3 days ago and had the chance to used them yesterday because I needed to wash them first.  I must say these brushes work really great, they are thick and very soft.  The application of my cream foundation was great.  I might get two more sets, one to keep and one to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, high quality and sleek brushes</li>
    <li> I ordered two specific brushes and not the full set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes each came in their own protective plastic sleeve with instructions to clean the brushes before use, which is important. The brush quality is fantastic and work great for my liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> After trying my brush set, I have to say that applying my foundation, powder and blushes have been a breeze! I&#x27;m really impressed by the quality and softness of these brushes. The results of the application look better than when I&#x27;ve applied with my previous brush set. I look forward to trying other Beauty Junkees tools!</li>
    <li> Great brush!! Works just as good as the Sigma brush! Great price also! The brush arrived in just a few days after I ordered it! Will be making more purchases from this company in the future!</li>
    <li> I just got my kabuki brush and it looks very well made and perfect for foundation.</li>
    <li> Good basic set of eye make-up brushes.  No shedding of brush bristles and brushes are soft but firm enough detailed makeup application.  Need to air out brushes and bag before using due to weird smell.</li>
    <li> I loved my kabuki brushes! I loved that they were such a reasonable price too!</li>
    <li> Great brush!! Perfect density for foundation. Applies seamlessly. So soft too!</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and hold the makeup well. I just received them, but like them so far.</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush set is amazing! Bonus that it comes with a travel case.  These are almost an exact supe for the sigma kabuki set.  They are both dense and incredibly soft (no issues with shedding yet, knock on wood).  I would just love to see the tapered brush more tapered and the angled kabuki with a sharper angle for more precision and definition.  However for this price point these are well worth it.</li>
    <li> So far I LOVE my Kabuki makeup brush!! I used my fingers to apply my foundation before. That worked good but this brush is better! My liquid foundation goes on smooth and gives me a clean look. It is super soft and does not irritate my skin. Plus, it was delivered faster than expected... Great brush, highly recommended to all ladies and drag queens!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Makes my foundation looks flawless!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the feel of it on my face! So soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Brush gets great coverage with liquid - I&#x27;m so impressed!</li>
    <li> I really recommend thIs flat kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;With all the brands that exist now I was confused about what brand to get, but I am glad I choose that one. The quality is comparable with sigma, but for a better price. I love how versatile it is, I use with my foundation, concealer and powder. Is soft but firm and dense at the same time, my foundation goes on smoothly and gives a flawless finish but with more coverage than the sponge, the most I love is how gentle it is which is perfect for my sensive skin. It worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this flat kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;With all the brands that exist now I was confused about what brand to get, but I am glad I choose that one. The quality is comparable with sigma, but for a better price. I love how versatile it is, I use with my foundation, concealer and powder. Is soft but firm and dense at the same time, my foundation goes on smoothly and gives a flawless finish but with more coverage than the sponge, the most I love is how gentle it is which is perfect for my sensive skin. It worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This brush unfortunately did not last. Shedding is a huge problem and has made the brush unusable! The glue separated from the handle and the bristlea. So frustrating to pick the little bristles out of your makeup on your face. All the good reviews must be early on in their use of this brush because it will not last!  Original review: So far, so good.  Like the feel of this brush, it applied my foundation flawlessly today.  I got the 1 piece flat kabuki and I am glad to be able to throw out my makeup sponges now!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush.  I have always use sponges to apply my foundation.  I decided to try a brush after watching a YouTube video.  My foundation now looks flawless.</li>
    <li> I have to say that those are the best eyebrushes that i&#x27;ve used untill now. I have Sigma, Real Techniques and many more. The Beauty Junkees brushes are the ones to beat. They are the best....</li>
    <li> I absolutely luv these brushes!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long but I like its density and overall size and heft.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. First home I&#x27;ve used this type of brush. Love the application.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush :) It&#x27;s super soft and makes blending my foundation so easy!</li>
    <li> Nice brush, good price, good service. Thanks, Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, and the product is high quality. Would buy from Beauty Junkees again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> Omg! I&#x27;m in love with these brushes!</li>
    <li> Just purchased these makeup brushes and i absolutely love them! The travel case is quite large, but it&#x27;s just a bonus!!! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love the flat kabuki brush! It&#x27;s half the price of the sigma F80 brush, but works almost as the same as the F80. Blend liquid foundation really well, leave no streaks, give a natural finish and the foundation doesn&#x27;t go to waste by sitting on the bottom of the brush like other brushes does. I give 4 stars because the other 4 brushes are a little too dense, so it makes it harder to blend</li>
    <li> The kabuki blush brush is fantastic.  It is so soft and applies the blush perfectly to give you a natural glow.  No loss of bristles which has always been the problem with other brushes for me. you will love this kabuki blush brush</li>
    <li> Very high quality brush set.  Very pleased with my purchase  Would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got my brushes today. They are gorgeous, and very soft, but still firm enough to apply the makeup products. The most amazing fact: they came hermetically sealed, which guarantees hygiene. I will reuse such resistant plastic bag as a travel one.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered such amazing products.</li>
    <li> These brushes are heavenly!  Soft and yet sturdy, the brushes are all cut evenly and soft, soft soft.  I received another brand of brush (which was more expensive) and the flat top wasn&#x27;t flat.  There were several areas where bristles were longer than others.  Not so with these.  They are trimmed uniformly, and dare I say perfectly.  Like a well cut putting green, even and lustrous.  The packaging way exceed my expectations.  The brush holder is well made, again sturdy and perfectly sized.  Not too big, and not too small, just right.  I&#x27;m glad I followed the reviewers suggestion to \\&quot;just buy\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I have washed my brushes according to the directions but haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet. I do have a Sigma F80 and the flat top feels exactly the same. I will play with them this weekend.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price. I use an IT cosmetics kabuki and its just as good as that one. Applies makeup smooth and seamlessly. I love these amd highly recommend them. :)</li>
    <li> Loved the makeup brush, great price, great customer service.</li>
    <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only just received my brushes but from what I&#x27;ve already experienced, these brushes are great for the price you&#x27;re getting them for. I was considering getting Sigma brushes since my friend recommended them (and hers were super great), but then found Beauty Junkees. I was a bit skeptical at first since these brushes were marked down so much, but then I read others&#x27; reviews and people seem to love them.&lt;br /&gt;I received my brushes just a few days ago and a couple of fibers came loose at the first washing. However, after using them for a couple of days I think they&#x27;re great! Picks up product really well and great for contouring. The bristles are so soft against your skin and definitely on par with some other kabuki makeup brushes I&#x27;ve tried that were all around $15-25.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, so I can&#x27;t really judge these on a professional level. But if you&#x27;re looking for a nice set of makeup brushes for a great price then I&#x27;d definitely go with this set! And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it comes with a traveling case!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Very high quality and packaged appropriately for shipment as well.</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush frankly exceeded my expectations. The price is lower and the quality is equal to the higher priced brushes. I received the brush in two days and the instructions for cleaning and care is included. Thanks Beauty Junkees, I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectations ! I already heard so many great reviews but when you receive it &amp; see for yourself, they&#x27;re amazing. The quality is so good &amp; the case was a lot bigger than I thought ! I can&#x27;t get over how soft they feel. I&#x27;m already in love &amp; have yet to use them ! Definitely do not regret getting this !</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m not a beauty junkie, but I am pleased with these brushes so far. My daily makeup regimen consists of sunscreen and a few dabs of BB cream. The brush I currently use was a freebie from a friend&#x27;s makeup purchase. My standards aren&#x27;t too high. I just need brushes that will not shed ( worst pet peeve) and will apply makeup lightly. I did some research and learned that natural brushes tend to be heavier in application so there went that choice. Based on the reviews and Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service, I felt confident in this purchase. I have only washed the brushes and haven&#x27;t used them yet (I&#x27;m also on summer break so who knows when I will actually wear makeup next) but I can tell you that while cleaning thoroughly, there was absolutely no shedding so far. The brushes seem to be very well made. Thick and soft at the same time. I found a coupon code from a blogger online which made this purchase even sweeter! The company has already emailed me, letting me know how to best use each brush. Thank God, because I&#x27;m clueless! LOL!</li>
    <li> Best quality brush set for the cost. Highly recommended. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush thank youuu :)</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY BRUSHES</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> Brush is very soft and quality seems great! My favorite brush to apply foundation with. I am planning to purchase more!</li>
    <li> This is not the product I purchased, but I am very pleased with the Kabuki brush I purchased from this shop.</li>
    <li> These are the best Kabuki brushes I have ever used. I have used these on every single makeup application in the last few months and have been very impressed. They are very well made. They have never shed (and I have cleaned them multiple times). These are fantastic for applying foundation, highlighting, contouring, and even blush. I am so happy with my purchase and plan on getting these as gifts for friends. Amazing quality for the price. I have several high end brushes (MAC, Laura Mercier, Sigma, NARS) and I find that I reach for my Beauty Junkees brushes most often.</li>
    <li> Great brush - no stray hairs, soft, and easy to clean. Solidly attached to a comfortable handle as well. I use this with Jane Iredale mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> Brushes came quickly and look to be great brushes. So far they are wonderful brushes to use. Do a great job and I am very pleased with their performance.</li>
    <li> these are really great brushes.  the bristles are soft and spread product well.  and the convenient travel case is a big plus.  i was only looking for a single brush, but I am glad I bought the kit with 5.  the different sizes come in very useful.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! These brushes are my new holy grail to use when doing my face makeup. Price wise is a steal also. Who need to spend so much money for one brush, when you can use that money and get 5 for the exact same use and results. Going to recommend these to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup expert- far from it. But I think these brushes are amazing. I looked up many different brushes and their reviews and this product stood out. Not only do these brushes look great, but they feel great too. They are extremely soft on your skin. The case they come in looks very professional as well. And you definitely cannot beat the price!! All of my friends that have seen these brushes were amazed as well. I highly recomend these. The company even sends instructions that tell you what brush you use for different things which is so nice for someone who is a beginner like me.</li>
    <li> Love! I was looking at the Sigma brushes but they are so expensive! So I went with these and I&#x27;m so stoked! I&#x27;ve been using the flat kabuki daily and it hasn&#x27;t lost one bristle. My makeup goes on super smooth and I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of the brush. It feels high end on my face, in my hand and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Great for applying makeup and blending/contouring. The bristles are perfectly soft for my sensitive skin and they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> Just got brushes today and they look and feel better that expected. Like the case they came in. They have pretty strong smell to them but I am sure ones I leave them open it will air out... Four stars because I actually haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look very professional and I am sure will do great! They remind me of &amp;#34;it cosmetics&amp;#34; brushes and I like those...</li>
    <li> Very soft brush... Love the price and quality!</li>
    <li> Use these brushes everyday.  Very soft and does NOT shed.  Great set of brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> I actually only ordered the flat kabuki and mini flat kabuki. First impression is that they are so soft, probably the softest brush I ever own. Their application is very nice. Let&#x27;s hope it will last through washes but I have high hopes for these brushes</li>
    <li> Honestly extremely pleased with my purchase. I will buy again from BJ.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes, love them!</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes with amazing price !</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush! For the price, it&#x27;s of better quality than I expected. I&#x27;ve been using it for my mo wrap powder, and so far so good! I&#x27;m eager to order some of their other brushes!</li>
    <li> Really great product and service!</li>
    <li> So far i have no complaints. I just this brush everyday and i love how dense it is and how it applies my foundation.</li>
    <li> I purchased the flat brush. I am pleased with it, using it for my cream foundation. It provides good coverage and I like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Got them for my niece, she loves them. Great quality.</li>
    <li> This Flat Kabuki Makeup Brush is a makeup wonder and a must have! :D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews for anything but I have to say how much I love this brush! I bought a ton of brushes around the same time from another company but they didn&#x27;t have a kabuki stippling brush so I found this one on Amazon and bought it because of the great reviews and price. I am very happy with it so far, it&#x27;s incredibky soft and really does apply my makeup flawlessly. My husband even made a comment on my makeup the other day! You can tell its a quality brush just by feeling it.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this brush for the price! The brush is so soft and works great.  Great deal! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Best brushes I own! Unbelievable quality! Wooow! Arrived the next day too! I couldn&#x27;t believe it</li>
    <li> very soft bristles and my bare minerals foundations goes on super smooth!!</li>
    <li> Brush works very well. Cover very nicely!! Glad I got this one instead of the $40 I have used in the past. Very comparable.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They give my face a very smooth finish!</li>
    <li> Super soft and blends my makeup flawlessly</li>
    <li> I am not sure why it says the set is what I ordered as I only ordered the flat kabuki brush, but ithe is a fantastic brush nonetheless. I have used sigma brushes for quite some time now among other more expensive brands and ordered this one for my teenager since the cost was lower and she is not the best at taking care of things on a consistent basis. I tried it out to see how it compared to the others and actually like it better than my more expensive brushes. It is incredibly soft and easy to clean, and helps the makeup blend in very well. My daughter liked it a lot and is caring for it properly so I will buy her more brushes from them in the future. Which I will be doing. Now I wish I had gotten the brush set with holder, still wondering why it says I did. Anyway, great brush, great price and love the advice on cleaning brushes, although I use conditioner instead of olive oil to clean mine since it&#x27;s easier to rinse out. Redken color stay conditioner gets it the cleanest and conditions best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice and fast. Graciously sent cleaning instructions which I appreciate! Thank you!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Received quickly, great value, would buy from again</li>
    <li> Love how my foundation went on!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Soft enough to not irritate your face but firm enough to have flawless looking foundation. Cant wait to see if the other brushes work as well as this one! Price was amazing too!</li>
    <li> The Flat Kabuki brush is the best brush for liquid foundation.Hands down best brush out there!</li>
    <li> I am having trouble with some brown spots on my skin and wanted a foundation brush that would cover them nicely without it looking like I have too much foundation on. This brush works very well and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for around a week and it feels amazing. It is very soft and is amazing for bronzer/blush. There are also very convenient instructions in the back that explain the proper methods to clean the brush. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am impressed. With the good reviews and cheap price, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. The bristles are soft and not one came out when I did a test tug. Not sure how the casing will last but at this price you can easily replace every couple years.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Best foundation brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I got foundation brush, I&#x27;m using it for about a week, and so far very happy with the brush.</li>
    <li> Great quality for a great price.  Easy to use and comes in a nice case.</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush I&#x27;ve owned so far.  Excellent application at a great price!</li>
    <li> Bought this together with a cheaper version and there&#x27;s a big difference. This is dense but very soft.</li>
    <li> I love them they arrived 2 days earlier than they were suppose to. They are very neatly packed and nicely sealed almost as if they were trying to preserve the brushes! They look even better in person. They are sooo soft. I love them!! I strongly encourage others to buy this item you definitely wont be disappointed!! I am soo so pleased :))) I haven&#x27;t even seen anything in sephora this nicely preserved or this nice for this price!!! Thank you so so much beauty junkees i really look forward to purchasing more from you guys!</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation brush and very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve had this brush for a while now and it has not shed on me at all. Definitely a good brush at a cheap price!</li>
    <li> Softest brush I have ever used! Purchased it after a friend recommended it. Definitely a steal! So easy to apply and makes you look flawless!</li>
    <li> THIS IS AMAZING! I promise. I received it in 2 days with Amazon Prime. The brushes are so soft to touch, so well made (not like other cheap fragile material), and has such good flow while applying or even on touch. the whole 5 brush set is a Steal deal.&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste money on name brand brushes when these brushes provide the same finish..... I LOVE the brushes! An awesome independence day purchase!</li>
    <li> Omg i am in love with mt new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I used to soend ridiculous money on high end such as sigma brushes and i just got a brush that is JUST AS GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;this is such a good company because i even got an email making sure it arrived on time and that i liked it. I was a little nervous buying these but there are soo many youtube videos backing me up on this.</li>
    <li> good one.. worth buying..</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredible, especially at this price point. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a brush set!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve owned above Mac, Bobbi brown, and Sephora&#x27;</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. Very good quality and oh so soft. The carrying case is great because it is sturdy, yet not too big to be packed away.</li>
    <li> i typically don&#x27;t do many reviews but i decided to do this one! i had variety of issues with the name BRAND brushes I purchased thru AMAZON and the manufacturer directly.  I probably have every brush they ever made - with that said, 2 out of the gazilion brushes just fell apart out of no where so i contacted them since i only had them for about 5-6 months and to my gut, they basically told me i had to contact the 3rd party which was AMAZOn, they were gracious enough to give me a full refund on all of my brushes! I love AMAZON! So i started searching another brand as i was furious with them so i came across these GREAT brushes with great reviews, i was a bit hesitant as i typically use MAC or this OTHER brand but when I got them, LITERALLY i felt these were such high quality and BETTER than this OTHER brand!  I decided to buy all of these and a flat top to test them out and they are more DENSE, FIRMER but SOFTER! You won&#x27;t regret purchasing them as I plan to order the rest of their pieces!  THESE ARE GREAT BUY and none of the hairs fell apart like the other one.  The Handle is so firm and feel great when applying your makeup!  DON&#x27;T hesitate, BUY THEM NOW!  I hope Beauty JUNKIES create more brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after watching a review on youtube... I have never used the sigma brush they compared it to so I cant comment on the similarites but I can say I love this brush! Its dense but not to the point of being hard. It feels as though you barley have any makeup on!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!! I am getting a 2nd set to keep at work!</li>
    <li> I recently received this brush set in the mail and I wanted to take a moment to review.  First, the set came faster than I anticipated which is always a great thing! Second, I received an email about how to use and care for the brushes. It is very impressive for a company to make such an effort to reach out to the customer so they have my kudos. Lastly, the brushes are wonderful. So incredibly soft!!!! Certainly some of the softest brushes I own. I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet but I am excited to do so. Would I recommend this set? Absolutely!!!</li>
    <li> Really good brushes. Bought the whole set.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality brushes for a very nice price!  These brushes feel much more &#x27;lush&#x27; than others I have owned.</li>
    <li> They are really great. Soft and dense and make you foundation look flawless.</li>
    <li> I have to say I had the sigma f80 kabuki brush and other brushes. It got to the point they got really old and even after cleaning them I accidentally broke the handle of off one. They lasted a long time but were pricey. I can tell these will last a while and they are cheaper! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie with makeup brushes but I could definitely tell that these are comparable with the Sephora Collection Pro Airbrush since I recently bought one. Not only they have quality brushes but they also have excellent customer service!! When my order arrived in three days (very fast delivery) I was so excited to open it. Unfortunately, as I was pulling off the plastic, the handle broke. I sent Beauty Junkees an email with a picture of the broken handle. I received a reply the following day and received the replacement in less than a week! On top of a fast delivery and commendable service, they included a pack of brush gloves! I  am so happy with my purchase! Thank you so much Julie for a great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> The kabuki brush I bought is very soft and applies liquid foundation perfectly.  I stipple it on and then blend it with the brush and it comes out flawless.  The brush is fantastic for the money!  I have really expensive brushes that are not as nice as this one.  I&#x27;m definitely buying more!  And Beauty Junkees customer service is amazing ...</li>
    <li> I bought the flat top kabuki brush and it is amazing! It applies so smooth and gives a flawless airbrushed finish! Definetly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Ordered this last week and got it today, on a SUNDAY!! I&#x27;m quite pleased with the quality of this product. Will definitely repurchase this again!</li>
    <li> I recieved the brush set so fast! For a first impression review, packaging is 5 stars, quality is 5 stars, cost is 5 stars. This is a great value and these brushes are made very well. I think these will last me for a long time. I can say that these brushes are of higher quality than elf brushes and probably even eco tools brushes. I love my eco tools brushes but Im reaching for my beauty junkees brushes.</li>
    <li> Great price point, delivered promptly, good care instructions, good quality</li>
    <li> Very nice brush set.  The case keeps them neat and convenient.</li>
    <li> The foundation I&#x27;ve been using is somewhat difficult to apply due to it drying before I was able to spread it.  This brush was a god-send!!!  Now my foundation spreads easily and flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes! They apply foundation,concealer so well and evenly! This is a must have In your makeup bag</li>
    <li> I pitched these brushes 1 year ago. The top portion of the brushes no longer stay attached to the handles - ive had to super-glue the handles to the brushes. Overall, the quality of the brushes are great. Just disappointed in the quality of the construction.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for applying my BB cream and it&#x27;s near perfect! I had my first one for about a year and I&#x27;m sort of a germaphobe so I&#x27;d wash it very often. About after a year the hairs started to fall out mostly due to my over washing. So I just bought a new one! So excited to get to be using this brush brand new again!!</li>
    <li> So soft! I love these brushes! They look really nice and do a wonderful job!</li>
    <li> I am about to order another Brush!  Love the one I bought.  It&#x27;s of great quality and super soft on skin!  I would definitely recommend this vendor as they truly give exemplary customer service with the follow up email on how to use and care for your brush.</li>
    <li> This brush feels so soft! I love it because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s irritating my face. If you have sensitive skin, this is a great makeup brush to have.</li>
    <li> Seriously love these! They are totally comparable to high end sigma brushes but for a way better deal! The flat top is my favorite because I was looking for a wider brush and a more dense one and I definitely found it in these brushes! If you are skeptical I would say go for it because I am very pleased with these!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous brushes!!! The case that comes with them is great too! An added benefit was the sellers excellent communication skills and follow-up!</li>
    <li> Fantastic set and sooooo affordable. My foundation has never gone on better. Now use the powder, blush and bronzer brushes too!  The travel case/brush holder is a great bonus</li>
    <li> Great brush!  I love the feel of this brush and it definitely is a result of quality workmanship!  Provides a flawless finish!</li>
    <li> Woww seriously this brush is so worth it for the price I paid. It&#x27;s so high quality I can&#x27;t believe it. Seriously I definitely would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I only purchased one of the brushes this time - a rounded flat brush I think. I enjoy it as much as the last brush I ordered (a small tapered one). The bristles feel great, the packaging is nice. Beauty Junkees sends an email with the best uses for each brush and detailed care instructions. I&#x27;ve had the other brush several months and am very happy with the product and the company.</li>
    <li> I got my first BJ brush as a gift and I had to get my hands on the whole face set. They are so soft and seem to never lose that softness. I&#x27;ve washed my first flat kabuki about 20 times and it still feels and applies like it&#x27;s brand new. Also, there is minimal to no shedding which is a dream, as I&#x27;ve encountered that with many of the more affordable brand brushes. The travel case is so sturdy and as a &#x27;free&#x27; gift with this purchase, it&#x27;s incredibly luxurious. I&#x27;ll likely be purchasing the eye set as well, as I am officially a beauty junkee.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are high quality</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality - extremely soft, dense, no issues with shedding. Weight/balance is good, and the feel of the handle is comparable with that of more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> Has a strong odor out of the package (like strong smelling plastic or etc) so be sure to let it air out/wash it before use. Other than that this brush is very sturdy and the bristles super soft. Applies foundation great!</li>
    <li> the brush feel soft and gentle on my face. But I dont know what to use the flat angle brush for. I need to learn more about how to use them I guess. One thing I dont like is that the brush is kinda dense and it doesnt blend too good, especially for contour or blush.</li>
    <li> Brush is very nice It applies the makeup evenly.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. Very nice for the price. The company messed up my order, caught it before I did, and worked with me to fix it! They stand up to being washed well and are super soft. I do still prefer some natural brushes, but for some awesome staple brushes these are a great bet! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional makeup artist for over 10 years, and my honest opinion...GREAT BRUSH! Soft bristles but firm enough for flawless liquid foundation application.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this brushes, she said that are soft and easy to apply makeup</li>
    <li> The brush is a nice weight but the bristles were slightly squashed in the packaging so that they are not completely round but slightly oval shaped. I do like the fact that the bristles are soft and not extremely dense. Item was packaged securely.</li>
    <li> Love them! Great brushes for a great price and the holder is just a bonus!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes and quick delivery!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and allow for flawless application of my liquid makeup. They are GREAT for the price. You do not have to spend a lot of money for brushes to do the same job as more expensive brands. BUY THESE, NOT THOSE!</li>
    <li> Good, simple brush. It&#x27;s really easy to clean and I use it for foundation. I wasn&#x27;t really sure about it at first, but now it&#x27;s the only brush I use. I like it because the bristles don&#x27;t soak up all the foundation, meaning my foundation lasts longer than if I used brushes that aren&#x27;t as dense. It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and gentle on the skin. The size of the brushes is just right and the packaging is well done. These are great quality brushes for a very affordable price. After washing the brushes I did not experience any shedding or flimsiness. The shipping of the brushes did not take very long either! All in all I&#x27;m glad i purchased these brushes!</li>
    <li> Great packaging. Great quality. Definitely beats going to a makeup store and spending $40/brush when you can get a great set of high quality brushes PLUS great travel pouch to ensure the brushes don&#x27;t get wrecked. The brushes are sleek looking and feel great on the skin. Travel time to receive the package was very fast. Thank you! The brushes exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are EXCELLENT quality.  I have worked in the makeup industry and still do occasional freelance work and have a makeup blog as well, and I now recommend these brushes to everyone and have given them as gifts to friends!  Each one is the perfect shape and texture for its purpose (I especially love the Pro All Over Shader brush for packing color onto the lid and the Pro Blending brush, which totally gives the MAC 217 a run for its money), and they wash easily and dry quickly!  I love that Beauty Junkees also takes the time to check with you after each purchase to see if you enjoy your brushes and give you tips on how to clean them!  (Their tip for using both an oil and a mild soap to clean their kabuki brushes works so well!  I usually will use either olive oil or the [[ASIN:B00HZ3LX3I Garnier Clean+ Nourishing Cleansing Oil For Dry Skin, 4.2 Fluid Ounces]] plus [[ASIN:B005C2N8IC Shea Moisture African Black Soap Bar Soap-8 oz]] to clean these, and for regular brushes that I only use powder products with, just the soap.  This soap cleans better than any &amp;#34;brush cleaner&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used, by the way).  Bravo to Beauty Junkees for making top-notch brushes at affordable prices!</li>
    <li> Super soft.. had to trim a couple strays when first received, but no big deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought all of these seperately, but I really wish I would have gotten the whole set. These brushes are super soft and great quality. I wash them with the bareminerals conditioning shampoo to clean them and it works perfectly with these. Compared to any other brand Id buy these hands down. I use them everyday I wear make up and have even bought them for my sister. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Beauty Junkees kabuki brushes</li>
    <li> I have bought the flat angled kabuki after seeing saaammage ( youtuber who have a $5 discount for these brushes) rave about these brushes after each of her foundation demo videos. I have a Sigma F80 brush and I love that brush but this brush( feel lighter then my F80) is now on the same level! I put side my F80 and RT expert face brush to test this brush for a week. It have done an amazing job!! It doesn&#x27;t leave any streak marks and makes my foundation smooth. I will for sure will be buying more brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush was packaged pretty nice and was very soft and easy to clean but for a kabuki brush it could have been a little stiffer. But still a great brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy w/ my new brush it&#x27;s great quality love how soft it is</li>
    <li> I was so surprised when these brushes arrived. First of all the leather case is like a thermos case, unsnap the sides and pull the top off and bam to see the brushes have to say, now I see and feel the difference in quality brushes versa the drug store brand. I truly love that beauty junkees were on top of the order and sends ya email how to use the brushes and how to take care of them. Very nice touch. If your looking at theses brushes don&#x27;t hesitate, you will be please.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Angeled Kabuki brush and I simply love this brush for contouring my face it gives an airbrushed finish. I&#x27;ve washed the brush and no shedding AT ALL. This is a great buy and I will definitely be buying more from Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I am so happy about this brush because I have used my fingers to blend in my tinted moisturizer which was working awesome for me, but I recentl  switched to a liquid foundation and I did not own a kabuki brush yet. I was debating on whether to purchase the F80 sigma brush (which was expensive to me) and this one I found. After reading the reviews I said, what the heck, I am ordering this one from beauty junkees. It is AMAZING. It blended my foundation so perfectly! Please buy this one. You definitely will not regret it. I am in love.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The coverage is nice and I like how stiff and soft it was so i could blend it more. Definitely purchasing from Beauty Junkees in the future!</li>
    <li> Works well, and feels like a high quality brush, especially for the price! I&#x27;d definitely purchase more brushes from this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> At First Glance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are very soft and high quality as others have reviewed, but some brushes are more dense than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The round, angled and tapered brushes are more dense than the flat top kabuki brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to the flat top kabuki because I thought it would be a lot denser than others I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare to the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki, price and quality, definitely give these brushes a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the round kabuki!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t used them yet to apply my makeup, a second review will be made for my overall impression of these kabuki brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this brush! I&#x27;ve been using MAC brushes for many, many years and this brush is so much better and doesn&#x27;t shed like MAC!  I will replacing all of my MAC brushes with these!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. It is super soft and applies my makeup and makes it look flawless.</li>
    <li> Honestly the softest brush I have ever felt! You can get amazing coverage and beautiful application with this brush! Definitely worth trying! :) also a $5 off code for any brush by this seller is: SAAMMAG</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft. The bristles are dense. This is exactly what I was looking for. Everything is neatly packaged and super easy to transport. If I had one complaint it would be that the brushes are a little long and didn&#x27;t fit in my makeup kit. I attacked the accompanying bag to the side of the case and everything works perfectly now.</li>
    <li> I got the flat top kabuki brush and it&#x27;s completely amazing. The quality of this brush is insane for the price tag. I will most definitely be repurchasing brushes from this company.</li>
    <li> My first foundation brush arrived today and I am very pleased. It is very soft and full.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! I bought a few other different kinds from other big name high end beauty companies, and this is by far my favorite! Applies liquid foundation smooth and even and the bristles are so soft on your skin!!</li>
    <li> love this brush. just as good if not better than the sigma flat kabuki and cheaper. Would repurchase and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love the blush brush!!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  It spreads my foundation evenly onto my face.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I highly recommend it, this was one of the best Amazon experiences I have had.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush. Great follow up support.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes!  Best I have ever owned. Fast delivery and great follow up.  I gave already told my friends to go online and check them out.  I&#x27;m going to order more this week.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Applied liquid foundation perfectly and with medium to full coverage.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and apply makeup beautifully. I&#x27;ve not tried the sigma brushes, and now feel that I don&#x27;t need to!!! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use other brushes. :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best ever! The denseness and softness makes it really easy to apply. Where have I been all these years? OMG, the application of foundation goes on very smoothly without streaking and not wasteful by putting it on a sponge where it sops it all. The price is very affordable and ih so worth it! You&#x27;ll be very happy with these brushes!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the brush and how evenly it allows me to apply product. I would highly recommend Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super quality and I love them.  I will be back for more</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new Kabuki brush.  My powder foundation goes on very smooth with this brush.  Thank you to Beauty Junkee for sending along detailed cleaning instructions</li>
    <li> Great product, Easy Delivery</li>
    <li> These were just what I was looking for and they are performing as advertised.  I am very pleased.  They arrived practically as fast as I ordered them, and I didn&#x27;t pay for any special fast shipping.  Clear information on how to care for brushes was included.</li>
    <li> very nice brush, softer than my sigma f80, works just as well if not better!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Applies foundation flawlessly. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> It is unbelievably well priced with such great quality and softness of the bristles.  I highly recommend this product to anyone and it is much more affordable than the sigma brush!</li>
    <li> Ordered the flat foundation brush. So far, happy with it for the short time I&#x27;ve been using it. Using it for heavier foundation application. A couple of fall outs after first washing it, but maybe that&#x27;s expected. Order came quickly, w/ no issues.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the shipping</li>
    <li> These are great brushes - very soft and they blend makeup and apply contour and blush without pulling - LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> Nice thick  contour brush and no bristles fall out when being used</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I needed some new makeup brushes so I browsed Amazon to come across these wonderful brushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier! Money well spent</li>
    <li> Love my new make up brush...love it so much I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom.</li>
    <li> It is so feathery soft and the seller provides amazing education and ideas for application.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, as promised. I love this brush for concealer. It&#x27;s percect. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are dense and super soft!&lt;br /&gt;Just started using them and havent seen any fallout.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation goes on really smooth and they clean up really easy!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the quality of these brushes!  They are such a nice price, too!  The bristles are extremely soft and each brush feels very well made - has a good heft to it and feels securely connected to the ferrule.  The brush cups are amazing!!!  They make it easy to tote the brushes and are the perfect storage option for at-home use.  I truly cannot recommend these brushes enough.  Plus, the customer service is fantastic - they sent a follow-up email with tips on how to use and care for each brush.  So impressed!!</li>
    <li> I use it for mineral powder application, and it works very well. Great value, I&#x27;m going to buy the rest of the set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and I enjoy it. Is there anything else you would recommend for me? Ie a set of make up kit to enhance my collection</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this make up brush.  Provides good coverage.  Good value.</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing, and rivals that of many higher end brushes, including Sigma sets. The flat Kabuki is my go-to for any foundation I use, and spreads it evenly, giving me fuller coverage. The only one I don&#x27;t have much use for is the round kabuki, but I&#x27;m sure I can be creative</li>
    <li> Love the foundation brush, best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Very soft and applies mineral makeup very well. The only thing, I wish it came with a brush cover. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. So soft and they don&#x27;t shed!  Makeup goes on flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Super soft and compareable to Stigma brushes but on the cheap! Got the set of five with travel case.</li>
    <li> I am so incredibly happy with the way that my foundation smoothly goes on my skin! I have always been very self conscious about the redness and uneven tones of my face and this brush has truly helped me with those issues!! Great product and great customer service!&#x27;</li>
    <li> These brushes are extremely soft and great quality! They definitely compare to high end brushes but with a more realistic price! The case that comes with the set is perfect for transporting. I will be using this set for a wedding coming up.</li>
    <li> So far so good the brush is soooo soft and it was easy put on powder and it blended perfect!</li>
    <li> I ordered the foundation brush and it is very sturdy and high quality....nice find</li>
    <li> the brush is soft, dense, feels amazing on my skin!  very evenly covers with powder (haven&#x27;t tried liquid yet).  I would give this product 5 stars, except it smells strongly of plastic/weird chemical.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from the packaging and will disperse especially after I wash the brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it as soon as it came. I bought 2 brushes 1 for powder and 1 for liquid. They worked great on both and was easy to use following the tips that came with the brush. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The flat kabuki brush is by far my favorite brush. The bristles are so soft and dense that I only need half as much product for full coverage!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Flat Kabuki brush recently and so far I like it, the bristles are soft and dense and the brush feels sturdy in my hand.  However, right out of the package it had a few bristles fall out which makes me concerned for the future, sometimes that happens at first but it doesn&#x27;t shed any more after the first time but other times it continues to happen which if that happens I will have to toss this brush.  I am hoping that was just a fluke and that I will continue to love this brush as it seems to be a good quality overall for the price.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes I would buy again if I need too</li>
    <li> Purchased the flat top foundation brush.  Great coverage for my liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!!! They are wonderful brushes, as well as affordable!!! I found my holy grail brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> After my Mary Kay (hey, my mother-in-law sells them, okay?) brush fell apart after a few months, I started looking for a foundation brush that didn&#x27;t clump up or have the bristles fell out. I looked on Sephora first, but most of the highly-rated brushes were about twenty dollars or more. I looked at the reviews for foundation brushes on Amazon, and I found the Best Foundation Brush Flat Top Kabuki from Beauty Junkees. I have been using this brush for a month, and wow, it&#x27;s so soft and doesn&#x27;t clump! I use liquid foundation, and it looks flawless when I put it on.    My husband bought me the 5 piece set, and I love using the angled brush for my blush. (I use Tarte cheek stain.) It&#x27;s also very soft and places the blush on nicely. I haven&#x27;t used a mineral-type blush on it yet.    Also, the set comes with a sturdy case. I usually leave the top off the case for easy access of the brushes on my bathroom counter. If you want to travel with it, just make sure you turn the case upside down, so the brush handles are showing, and then put the top over it; otherwise, the makeup brushes get in the way of the lid case.    The quality of these brushes are good, but without the high price tag. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another for my friend. :)</li>
    <li> this brush is incredibly soft, and provides full coverage that&#x27;s nearly--or equal to--the coverage that i got when finger-applying makeup. looking forward to buying more!</li>
    <li> Super soft and good quality</li>
    <li> I love it!! Flawless finish, effortless results, great seller, excellent price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> BEST BRUSH for powder foundation that I have ever used!  I have been buying the Bare Minerals brush every 3-4 months, and they shed even when they are brand new.  I have been using this brush for a week and I love it!  No shedding and it places the foundation down perfectly!  So happy I found this brush.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, would definitley recommend! I use this brush for my foundation and its 100% soft! It does not irritate my skin nor does it feel like plastic fibers on my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered the flat kabuki brush and I am beyond impressed with the brush&#x27;s quality. The bristles are extremely soft to the touch but stay intact. The brush also came with cleaning instructions that used household items, which saves me another purchase. I hope to buy the rest of the kit soon, as this brush provided professional airbrush results at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> Beauty Junkees has been wonderful keeping in touch with me about two of the brushes yet to come in, plus they send many helpful tips on the brushes, care, use, etc...their communications are excellent. The brushes did not disappoint, as good as many I have purchased including Goss. Thank you Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> I received these brushes within the days of ordering.  Two if you only count business days. As soon as for them I opened my&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees&#x27; Flat Top Kabuki. It does have a strong smell when you open our but ad soon as i washed it, it came off.  When I pulled it out of its package, I was immediately impressed.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it was dry I used it to apply my make up. While I did base my purchase I  all the amazing review hopeful based on other reviews, I was still unsure of what to expect.  This brush is amazing. The brush head is firm and soft at the same time.  It feels great as I apply my make up.  Make up goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;So far so great.  If there is any problems I  the future I will be sure to update my reviews.  However as of now I&#x27;m in Love with this brush I&#x27;m even considering buying the 5 pc set now.  i recommend it to everyone and I will make sure top let my sisters know about my amazing find.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, it spreads the makeup on so evenly and it&#x27;s soft on your skin, it also is a durable well crafted product, I haven&#x27;t had any strands of the brush stuck on my face or on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely reccomend this product, I don&#x27;t regret spending the amount of money I did on it because it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my very first set of brushes so I can&#x27;t compare them to others but so far I love them!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The application is flawless :) I definitely recommend it for the price!!</li>
    <li> amazing brushes best part is that they do not shed, they are compared to sigma as one of the best and afforfable</li>
    <li> They are very soft and shiny out of the box.  They are about the length of the Real Technique brushes.  The BJ Flat top brush has a larger diameter than the Real Technique stipple brush and the Sonia Kashuk flat top brush. The brush holder has a strong plastic scent, but the brushes didn&#x27;t have them. They have a flat rounded bottom so I thought they would stand but I could only get the flat top to stand. It is much cheaper on Amazon than their website. So far pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes were really soft! The brush holder was big. I was expecting it to be smaller but that is okay. I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone who wanted makeup brushes. She loved them. I&#x27;ve never own Sigma brushes but I&#x27;m sure these brushes are just as good. Beauty Junkees brushes are good quality and affordable. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and dense.  I have brushes by IT Cosmetics and they are similar but Beauty Junkers brushes are softer.  If you stipple up and down, the difference is especially noticeable.  I wash after each use and they are dry by the next day.  There has been no shedding at all.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I bought the other set over six months ago and they were the best set I&#x27;ve ever had. I like them so much I added the Kubuki set to my wish list. Just got them Christmas morning and they are just as amazing as the other set!</li>
    <li> Love this product, was totally worth the money</li>
    <li> Got as a Christmas gift. Works wonderfully! Will def buy more of these products in the future.</li>
    <li> My daughter received these for Christmas, and she is REALLY enjoying them. The holding case is a very nice bonus. They are very nice quality. She hasn&#x27;t found a use for all of them yet (she uses two mainly at this point). I expect they will last quite a long time, but I&#x27;ll update here if it is different from my initial expectation.</li>
    <li> Affordable brushes with high end quality. No shedding, the round top kabuki is perfect for seamlessly buffing in foundation! Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the brush set after reading positive reviews on Amazon. Shipping was super fast and nicely packaged. I washed the brushes as soon as I got them and no fall out whatsoever. They all feel dense and very soft. The travel case will come in handy. Overall excellent quality brushes. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> First of all...I ordered this brush set yesterday a little before noon - by the time I ran errands, watched a movie, ate dinner, and got home (before 9pm), the package was already on my doorstep!!!&lt;br /&gt;The makeup brushes AND tube/holder is excellent quality, really sturdy, the perfect weight, and look luxurious.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes. No shedding and really easy to keep clean. So soft but but easy to control coverage.</li>
    <li> I just received my brush and I am very pleased with the quality. The brush feels very soft and smooth, similar to that of Sephora brushes! The handle of the brush feels very sturdy, not in risk of falling apart. I took off one star for the bad smell, but hopefully a good couple more washings will remedy that. No hairs fell out when I washed it so thats a plus! Overall quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery ! I heard so many great things about these brushes and they definitely lived up to all they hype! My foundation applied flawlessly and the brush did not soak up product the was some of my other pricier brushes do. I m definitely buying a couple more to keep as a back up .</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are amazing quality and price.  I have a ton of brushes from high end to drug store and I cannot believe how great these brushes are.  I bought the angled brush first and came back to buy the whole set since they were so great! The brushes  are very soft, but dense enough to provide smooth even coverage of all types of foundation.  The angled brush is great for bronzer, the perfect size to blend out your contour powder or cream.  I have washed them once and had no shedding and the brush all retained their shape..  They do take a while to dry but that is because of their density.  I just saw the exact same set of brushes from sigma for a much higher price and I have to say that I love these more. ( I have many sigma brushes and I do like them)  They surpass them in quality and an added bonus price :) I would def. recommend them to everyone and there is no real risk because they do have a great money back policy.</li>
    <li> Second Updated Review (5 star rating): I contacted Beauty Junkees and they replaced the brush. Customer service indicated that the brush was most likely defective. They sent me a new brush. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Updated Review (1 star rating): Bristles fall out after a few months use. Disappointed; I have other brushes that I have used for years without them falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review (5 star rating): Love this brush! Works great for foundation!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I am a makeup brush novice but read and watched many reviews and decided on this set. I feel it has all the brushes I need for different makeup application and the tips they send you on how to use the brushes are super helpful.  I like the holder they come in so the brushes have a place where they will not get mess up when stored. Most of the YouTube reviewers have coupon codes to use which make these brushes even more affordable!</li>
    <li> Amazing plush brushes. I am new to kabuki brushes. I bought these and other cheaper ones. These apply foundation without hanging onto product.</li>
    <li> Blends makeup well. Not sure how I got by without it! Quality is on par does a really great job.</li>
    <li> I was about to spend a crazy amount of money on brushes at my local beauty store but thankfully decided to check Amazon first. And I&#x27;m so glad. I received this high quality brush for a fraction of the cost. I don&#x27;t know much about makeup or brushes but the brush I ordered easily applies and spreads foundation without streaks. The brush also came with instructions for cleaning and use..which was extremely helpful! Great customer service and product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very well crafted, and make application a breeze</li>
    <li> These eye brushes are as good as the more expensive Sigma brushes I have owned in the past. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. They even come with a lovely case for them. Thank you Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> I have to say, I srarted off being a little more than disappointed when I received my items, but Beauty Junkees&#x27; customer service turned that around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package I was super excited and then seriously disappointed to see that the tapered kabuki brush had been cut wrong. Instead of coming to a point sratight up at the top it was off to the side ! Obviously it had been cut wrong lol (funny now but not so at the moment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Junkees&#x27; customer service handled the dilemma wonderfully. They simply asked me to send them a pic of the defective brush and quickly offered to send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the brushes are very nice. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes! They are high quality made and the bristles are very soft. It helps my makeup glide on so smoothly. I even used it on my 81 year old mother and it gave her a flawless finish! She wants some now. :) The price for these are just incredible for the quality! Thanks so much! I&#x27;m going to be a regular customer.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Makeup goes on very smooth without any fine lines. Love it and have already recommended it to my sister. Fast shipping too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wow, softest brush I&#x27;ve ever owned-applies makeup so evenly-it&#x27;s a dream!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  I would buy them again and I would recomment them.</li>
    <li> I got the 5 piece kabuki set with the leather holder and the 5 piece precision set with leather pouch. Love these brushes! They rival any high end, expensive brush. I&#x27;ve had the flat top kabuki and the round kabuki for about 8 months now, and I love them, so when I came across a great coupon code on one of my YouTube subscriptions, i jumped at the chance to get both sets for a very good price. The bristles are soft and dense and the handles are nicely shaped and easy to hold. The leather pouch and leather holder are much nicer in person, they don&#x27;t look like a cheap freebie.</li>
    <li> So far so good. The bristles are soft and are good at blending.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen similar quality product for same/lower price. I expected better quality after reading all great positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed because the brush, even though soft, is too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; for me. I expected thicker!</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this brush set! The bristles are so soft but very dense. I received helpful tips on how to use each brush and how to care for them. I’ve never received such great customer service from an Amazon order before. The makeup tube is great for traveling. I can’t wait to try the rest of their brushes. Thank you Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> Good customer service! I like it! very helpful. :)</li>
    <li> Great Purchase indeed&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping got here before expected day&lt;br /&gt;let me say that there really good brushes and great Packaging&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t think twice in buying them super happy (::</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft and the application is flawless! I need a whole set to complete my life! :)</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush! Super soft, easy to use, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> These brushes are phenomenal! I like these better than the Sigma brushes because Sigma&#x27;s are almost to dense to blend out with. These are much easier to work with and are a lot cheaper. But you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that by the quality. Plus the brush case is an added bonus! I can&#x27;t wait to get the mini Kabuki set. So impressed!</li>
    <li> Brush does have a chemical smell when you take it out of the packaging,  but it dissipates after you let it air out.  Bristles are nice and soft and brush seems to be very well made.  No loose bristles.  Very impressed for the price.  Puts product on evenly and well.</li>
    <li> I bought the single rounded brush and will be buying the complete set soon. I was really surprised at how soft and smooth the brush is. It was a bit smaller than I expected but that really makes it more manageable as an overall face brush. I use the bare minerals brand powder which is costly  This brush applies so much more evenly than the standard bare minerals brushes and way softer. The smaller size but very compact bristles, hold the powder well and apply to all parts of your face evenly.</li>
    <li> This brush provides a flawfree, airbrush finish with my liquid foundation. I have used beauty blenders in the past and thought that was my end-all-be-all, but this brush has quickly converted me. Perfect!</li>
    <li> So far I like them...they are sturdy and full. Time will tell how they hold up. Also love the case that they come in but it has a strong chemical smell. Nonetheless, the case will help keep the brushes free of much dust and will make it easy to travel.</li>
    <li> I bought the flat top and it&#x27;s super soft! No shedding or chemical smells, which is a good sign. Plus I got it on a good deal :D</li>
    <li> The Beauty Junkees 5-piece Kabuki Brush Set arrived in excellent condition. Ferrules are glued securely to the handle - no wobble here. So far, no shedding either although I&#x27;ve only washed them once. The bristles are pretty dense and are fairly soft. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re just as soft or even softer compared to my Real Techniques brushes. That said, they&#x27;re not quite as soft as the bareMinerals Precision Face Brush (similar to the Flat Angled Kabuki). The Beauty Junkees brushes just felt a teeny tiny bit scratchier but only when I become heavy handed when buffing in product and put too mush pressure. Given these are like 1/3 or 1/4 of the price of the bareMinerals brush, though, can&#x27;t really complain. My faves from this set are the Flat and Flat Angled Kabuki (for putting in liquid foundation and tinted moisturizer). They give very good coverage and even application with no streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush case is also really convenient, too. It&#x27;s great for travel or just as a brush holder for the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while these aren&#x27;t the nicest brushes I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve certainly found them to be very good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and applies foundation well. I totally recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> The flat top is very soft I have to use it more to figure how it works</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!  The tips for care of brushes as well as what tool is best for what was an added bonus.  Arrived on time and will ordering from these guys again</li>
    <li> Love my brush! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> These brushes are high quality. Absolutely love them so much I bought the other types also.</li>
    <li> Good customer service.  I ordered the regular sized brush set but was sent the travel size set on accident. I emailed the seller and they got back to me in a timely manner and apologized for the mixup.  They immediately shipped the correct set and I received it in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that for the regular sized brush set, it&#x27;s difficult to close the holder if all brushes are inside.  The bristles will get smushed.  But I assume, one wouldn&#x27;t bring all the brushes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, brush quality is so far so good as a 7 day owner of the set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I went on Amazon to purchase a MUCH more expensive brand of brushes and these Kabuki&#x27;s came up as a suggestion. They had so many good reviews that I was intrigued. I immediately jumped on Utube to see if any of my favorite makeup gurus had reviewed them. I found one tutorial using them, and I could see the quality and denseness of the brushes. I also love the customer service from this company. I was originally shipped the wrong brushes, and it was quickly rectified. The customer service is top notch. Get these brushes now ladies. I am certain they are gonna be the next big name in makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I first need to comment on the fast delivery! A day earlier than expected-fantastic. Second, the packaging. Absolutely beautiful! It is quite apparent that Beauty Junkees puts time and effort into their customer&#x27;s packaging. It arrived in a box lined with pink tissue paper (so cute) and all the brushes were individually wrapped! I washed them up with some baby shampoo and allowed them to dry. Make sure you give them adequate time to dry because the bristles are so densely packed it takes a bit longer. Used them for the first time today and OMG these are my new HOLY GRAIL brushes! I am so impressed by them and it comes with a great storage container that all 5 brushes fit perfectly in (you can use the other half of the container for your other brushes as well). Great Job Beauty Junkees! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> These brushes are awsome, I love everyone of them. The bristles re thick and soft and they never shed. I often find my daughter stealing them to use. The case is very, very handy especially because I travel a lot. I usually use Sigma Brushes which no doubt rate a 10 plus but I just wanted to try another band out and I m so glad I did because I saved a boat load of money and they are some brushes!! BUY THESE BRUSHES YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the pointed kabuki face brush and when it arrived I was thrilled! The quality is amazing &amp; comparable to the fancy expensive Sigma brushes but they  cost half the price. The brush is very soft and dense. It blends out my concealer perfectly. It also washes well too. I will definitely purchase Beauty Junkees brushes in the future. The company even sent me an email about how to care for their brushes which to me is amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> Great brushes..full size..very very soft which is great for older eyes! Love the well made case and that the brushes are labeled.  I also appreciated the e-mail with instructions as how to use each brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes came in perfect condition. They&#x27;re really soft and good quality. They hold up well and are perfect as a travel set. They have full length handles so they&#x27;re easy to use as well</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love these brushes... They are comparable to the IT Cosmetics brushes. Very dense and super soft. I love the long handled kabuki&#x27;s very easy to get the right amount of leverage when you are buffing out and blending. Also, the leather case was great as a holding station... I used one side for the kabukis and other face brushes, and the other end to hold all my eye brushes. This was an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> I love the kabuki foundation brush. It works very well. I got it 2 days after ordering it. I will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m forever looking for decent brushes and I finally found them with this set! The quality is great and the case is top notch!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!the price is amazing. The application and range of brushes is great. Will continue to use Beauty Junkees products from now on. Recommend !!!</li>
    <li> I bought the flat top kabuki brush and oh my gosh. It&#x27;s AMAZING. It is such a high quality brush that buffs my foundation in really well. The price is also amazing and really can&#x27;t be beat. The head is dense and incredible soft. Please love yourselves more by buying these affordable and quality brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush hairs are soft yet firm enought to get a good coverage with foundation. Sturdy handle and good quality. The only downside in the case it comes in. The brushes fit very snug and would fit best if you but gloves on them. Other than that the case is a good sturdy quality. I would buy more brushes for sure. Since I&#x27;m on a budget these were a good alternative to the sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes and the case ( I went for the full set).  The brushes are well made, granted I have only used them for a week now but I can tell the difference. They brushes are densely packed and seem to distribute product well.  The only problem I see (if you can call it that) is for the all over powder brush it is so dense it doesn&#x27;t yet cover a large area.  This should get better with more use.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my post in a month.</li>
    <li> Better than Sigma F80! I have both  brushes i purchased  this one as a back up. This brush  has replaced the Sigma brush It is now my go to.</li>
    <li> Easy and goes on smoothly. Britles are soft and able to put right amount of powder/blush</li>
    <li> Just used the kabuki foundation brush for the first time and am very impressed with the results. I used the stipple method and my foundation does indeed look much smoother and more evenly applied than the far more expensive flat foundation brushes I had been using! I plan to use the brush for about a month and if the quality of the product holds, I will consider purchasing more brushes from this line. it is indeed a pleasant surprise to find such a great performing brush at such a reasonable price! I also received an email from the seller shortly after placing my order, along with instructions on using the product - a very professional touch!</li>
    <li> Great brush for a great price</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and company</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect! Before, I would use sponges or my fingers to apply my foundation lol but then my friend introduced me to this brush and my first reaction was that it had to be expensive, but then I found out it was very affordable so I went ahead and ordered myself two! It&#x27;s firm, and applies my foundation evenly around my face, giving it a perfect finish! I would recommend this brush to anyone whose looking for a nice make up brush for a very great price! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is perfect!!! i can&#x27;t express how much brushes I had to buy to get that perfectly blended look and buying this brush cake with high expectations, and it is perfect!! It&#x27;s beautiful, lightweight , easy to clean, and blends perfectly!</li>
    <li> Get product and great service! Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Nice brush. Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Does not waste product as it relates to using liquid foundation. Speedy Delivery. Packaging in order. However no instructions came to date as promised for the  suggested make up application tips.</li>
    <li> I love my new beauty brush! I used it for the first time this morning to contour my face and it looks amazing and natural. The brush blended evenly and didn&#x27;t leave behind too much product. I will absolutely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush!  It had a large head for good coverage.  Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Let me say that I am not a makeup guru and so I don&#x27;t own the high-end brushes that a lot of people compare these brushes to. I do own the E.L.F brushes and the Coastal Scents 22 piece set and that is what I am comparing these to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry skin in the winter...I put good oils on my skin to help with the dryness and have to be very careful with brushes to not cause flakes on my cheeks and area between the brow...I mostly use a beauty blender (not that particular brand) because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this set because I wanted to see if I could use a brush with my dry skin to apply blush, bronzer etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat kabuki is great, but will need to wait till Summer...BUT its still great! very soft, dense and NO shedding (there were a couple longer hairs poking thru but I just trimmed them...no worries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the angled kabuki it applied and blended my blush beautifully and didn&#x27;t cause the flakes to flare. The tapered is great for getting under my eye, top of cheek highlight and again really soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this brush set or even the individuals if you don&#x27;t need the set...I love sets and holders...lol  These brushed are soft and dense and no shedding...really great quality and I am glad I stumbled upon the brand! I also highly recommend the eye brushes this company offers, great quality as well.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. Brushes are soft but dense. No shedding to worry about with these brushes. I have bought many kabuki brushes from just about every brand looking for the perfect brush set- I have finally found it- Thanks Beauty Junkees for a high quality brush set at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  I have purchased so many that end up shedding and these do not.  Full size brushes, no gimmicks here!  I also purchased the mini brush set too.  I am not disappointed in these brushes and neither will you.  Do yourself a favor and just order these already!  If you see brush hairs that are longer than others just clip with nail clippers instead of pulling the hairs out.  This helps with shedding too.  I still haven&#x27;t seen any since my original review.  :)</li>
    <li> Softest brush I have ever felt--my boyfriend won&#x27;t stop touching it! Great brush for the price. Really impressed.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush. I love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! I have the flat Kabuki and use MAC liquid foundation. Goes on smooth without leaving any streaks! Would buy this brush again in a heart beat and it&#x27;s such a great price!!</li>
    <li> Purchased the single flat angled kabuki. Love it.</li>
    <li> Delivered sooner than expected. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! They are really soft!</li>
    <li> Super soft, synthetic (Hypo-allergenice)brushes. Whoops the link from Beauty Junkees sent me to this page. However, I did not get this exact set of brushes. Though I Did purchase a couple of brushes featured: the Flat top Foundation / Highlighter brush and the Rounded Foundation brush which is so tapered you can use to apply Under eye Concealer. Fantastic coverage and seamless application. Did i mention these were Super soft? ;-) My goodness, they feel like a much more expensive, professional, animal hair brush.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Applies makeup smoothly. Just wish it had a better powder brush</li>
    <li> I received this set of brushes a few days ago but I love them already! Great quality, density, pretty balanced weight and nice to hold. I have about a billion brushes and I also work at Sephora in Color, so I&#x27;m used to handling/selling brushes every day. Sephora&#x27;s collection of brushes are incredible but I just had to try these out after I read so many great reviews. They don&#x27;t soak up excess foundation and they lay it over the face flawlessly. I&#x27;ve also used them for primer, concealer, and cream contour/blush. I&#x27;ve washed them with no bristle fallout which is splendid. I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them, I honestly would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I purchased the blush brush only and love it.  The brush is soft yet firm enough to apply my blush evenly.  I had previously purchased a Sephora brush at triple the cost and, in my opinion, this brush is far superior.  I would highly recommend the Beauty Junkees brand!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of brushes synthetic and real hair.  And expensive to cheap. The reason I  love  these  brushes are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;1. They are extremely soft and luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;2 They apply  the product ( powder or cream or liquid ) flawlessly.  No streaking or uneven applications.&lt;br /&gt;3. They wash up very easy. Don&#x27;t  shed, And retain their  shape when drying.&lt;br /&gt;4. They are vegan friendly&lt;br /&gt;5. They are very balanced in the hand in weight.  Not to light or flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;6. I am a freelance  makeup artist and my clients loved how soft they are.&lt;br /&gt;7. Also they are very dense.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking  for kabuki brushes these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes !! Really great value for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Kabuki Brush set with free brush holder by Beauty Junkees about couple weeks ago. I have been using brushes for applying BB creams, CC creams, foundations, powders. Very high quality brushes. Dense, very soft bristles. The entire set is just beautiful and very functional. Beauty Junkees customer service is outstanding. Thank you, guys, for making such an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Nice packaging. Brushes are soft and dense, very identical to IT cosmetic brush. Good quality and great price.</li>
    <li> Great brush! It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks when using it for foundation.</li>
    <li> Very Soft and works well for a really good price. WIll try their other brushes.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and they are everything I expected and more!  I recommend these for professional MUAs as well as amateurs.  😊</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying a brush without seeing it in front of me to test for quality but I was truly amazed at how well the brush blends and honestly threw away all my sponge applications. So much better! And the follow up emails with the advice on how to use and care the brush properly makes it all the more better. Definitely recommend their product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Kabuki brush for Glo Minerals because my esthetician suggested I get a flat top brush. This brush is very soft and feels good on your skin but is too soft to stir up powder from a compact.  It seemed more like it was rubbing or smoothing it down. Another foundation brush was necessary to pick up the powder.  I&#x27;m sure it does a good job spreading it on your face once you have the powder on your face but why switch brushes now that I&#x27;ve applied the powder with another?</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the two Kabuki makeup brushes that I have purchased. They work very well and they have held up very nicely. The additional information that the company sends regarding care and cleaning of the brushes is also very helpful.</li>
    <li> I have used all types of brushes from sephora but these brushes are the best , they blend to your skin so well and are easy to clean</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. You will not waste your foundation product and they apply smoothly. Simply amazing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush as a gift for my daughter after seeing this brush being use in a Beauty Blog!  My daughter uses the brush to apply foundation/consealor.  It really makes a difference.  Now I&#x27;m going to purchase a brush for me!!!  Love the brush, but this company even sent me directions on how to care for the brush.  Will be buying again!  Love, love, love!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the single Kabuki brush for 11.97. I was literally shocked at the quality of this brush! Not only are the bristles soft and thick, there has been absolutely no shedding!! I&#x27;m a makeup artist who specializes in weddings and photo shoots, so this is very important to me. I have an ItsCosmetics Heavenly Luxe brush that is similar that I paid $38.00 for, and a Bareminerals Heavenly Face brush for $30. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy Beauty Junkees! Both of my $30+ brushes are not as nice as my B.J. brush, and I&#x27;m very skeptic when it comes to quality. Very easy to clean, durable, and a good looking brush as well. Do yourself a favor and look no further for Great brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sponge applicators to apply foundation for many years but now that I&#x27;m in my 40s and my skin texture is changing, I didn&#x27;t feel that it was applying my foundation smoothly anymore. I spent many hours reading and searching for a brush that wasn&#x27;t expensive and was happy to find this. The bristles are very dense and applied my foundation nicely. Even around my nose area which is usually my biggest problem area.</li>
    <li> I use this brush with Dior air flash, and i only need to use a tiny bit of this makeup to have full coverage.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes. The quality is just as good as my Sigma brushes. And wayyyy more affordable too! I really love them. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! Their well made and affordable and I would recommend them, also I would buy them again. The foundation goes on smoothly and I love the softness of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Works like professional</li>
    <li> Okay, SO I am almost upset that I HAVENT invested in this brush sooner.  Price? Wonderful. Shipping? Wonderful. Quality? Wonderful.  If you love makeup as much as I do and want that perfect look this is the brush. As soon as it came in the mail I ran upstairs to apply makeup for a tester and WOW, results were amazing. It was perfectly even, smooth, and looked as if I had air brushed my face. I will def recommend this brush to anyone!!!  Another thing I loved was the seller- soon as I purchased I got an email with directions and other products similar, and when I did get it in the mail they sent me an email asking if I had received it and was checking, to me that shows that this seller cares about her customers and wants the best for them. As an online shopper, I like to know I am valued and cared about and BJ did great at making me feel that way.</li>
    <li> This brushes are great!! Good quality for a great price. I can&#x27;t believe I have been buying over priced makeup brushes. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my fiance and she says it is the nicest brush she has ever owned.  Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic. It&#x27;s great quality for a great price. Love the way it applies liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes! They are very soft and blend well. I am glad that shopped around on Amazon and stumbled upon these instead of going out and buying a set for an outrageous price. They took a a long time to ship but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I love your make up brushes, there soft easy to apply eye shadow, and the foundation, and there not expensive</li>
    <li> the brush is so soft, and blends the foundation so well, I&#x27;m now neglecting the previous foundation brush I was using</li>
    <li> The brushes came within two days of purchase and they are soft on your face and the bristles are dense and do no shed or fall out i deffinatly recommend buying these they are incredible i am inlove with them and will continue to buy products pf beautyjunkees</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I saw that it was a cheaper alternative to the Sigma F80. I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out $20+ for a brush and I saw many rave reviews so I decided to purchase it. The brush is great! It&#x27;s really soft and dense, it applies great! I use this instead of my beauty blender to get more full coverage look. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, I&#x27;m considering buying the flat angle kabuki.</li>
    <li> Best brushes I have ever owned!!  Wonderful quality!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the flat top kabuki brush by Beauty Junkees and it is amazing. It is so soft and buffs out my liquid foundation perfectly. It leaves my face looking and feeling airbrushed. I would highly recommend this brush to all makeup lovers and artists. I will definitely order the entire kabuki set soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a quality makeup brush to apply my liquid foundation.This brush is thick and very soft at an affordable price. I&#x27;m ready to wear my makeup now.</li>
    <li> Great brush! It is substantial and sturdy and the product arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great!  Love the quality of them. Makes my makeup go on flawlessly. Glad I purchased them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush % 100 fast shipping and flawless foundation for great price can&#x27;t be that. I will be doing a review soon. I hope to own all the collection.</li>
    <li> I bought the blush brush.  Used the other day and it was very soft, but worked great.  Applied the blush evenly and in the right spot.  Some brushes are so wide it make your whole face with blush.</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality brushes and great case! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the quality. Ordered the mini set as well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have not used anything but a sponge to apply makeup and decided I would try a kabuki brush instead. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot in the event I did not like the brush. I purchased the flat top kabuki and am AMAZED with the results! My makeup looks so much better and blended with this. So glad I purchased this at a fraction of the cost of others. Definitely recommend for starters!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush and fantastic communication on the sellers part. The brand is wonderful and I will definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I only ordered two of the brushes, not the set. But they are very nicely made and easy to use. I&#x27;ve only had them for a week but so far I am pleased and they are an amazing value</li>
    <li> I have tried the sigma kabuki face brushes and these are just as good if not better. I find myself reaching for these brushes every day. That are excellent quality and so soft!</li>
    <li> While I have many makeup brushes from a wide variety of companies and all price points, Beauty Junkees have become my favorite! They are soft, well-weighted, the perfect length and create the most beautiful eye looks with minimal effort. Having the right tool for the job makes all the difference and I truly enjoy playing around with these, so I have now started collecting the face brushes. There is no shedding and they wash wonderfully while performing wonderfully. I plan to own them all!</li>
    <li> Love the round top kabuki. Will be buying other brushes from this brand</li>
    <li> Super soft, perfect size and firmness to apply foundation.  I saw a review on youtube for this brush and decided to purchase it.  With the coupon discount, it was a fabulous deal and definitely worth it!  I have several other kabuki brushes and this is one of the best if not the best.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read A LOT of reviews before I bought this set of brushes. I have expensive brushes in my makeup bag that leave &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34; on my face. BJ brushes feel good, quality is impressive, and NO SHEDDING!! A product is only as good as the customer service, and I am equally impressed with the information for use and care. The brushes are thick and my mineral powder doesn&#x27;t fall off the brush. It sits on there. Love that. I get great coverage with these brushes. Each brush is labeled. Highly recommend over name brand brushes with higher price tags!!! Don&#x27;t pay for the name! Get these brushes</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  These brushes are luxurious and don&#x27;t shed.  The case is very nice and sturdy.  Thank you, Beauty Junkees!</li>
