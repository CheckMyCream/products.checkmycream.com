<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes!  You won’t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I think thier just as good as those big name brushes. Thier super soft. No fibers have fallen out. I like each and every one of the brushes in this set. Love the case too. Very good quality for a super nice set. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and and the case that came with it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely happy I gave these brushes a try!  I feel like a professional and love how it feels to put make up on without having splotches of liquid makeup on my hand!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, I love them!!!</li>
    <li> “These brushes are very nice &amp; soft. I have always used Bare Minerals makeup &amp; brushes. I got tired of paying $30 a brush &amp; decided to take a chance on other brushes out there &amp; these brushes I do love. They have shed a little since I have started using them but not a lot. They hold my bare minerals makeup very well. I got 8 brushes for the same price as one brush with Bare Minerals..”</li>
    <li> “I just received the makeup brush set and I am very impressed with the quality. The case is a great bonus too. I am happy to have a professional set of brushes! Great product! ”</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice and good quality</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. Very soft, excellent quality and the case they came in is very tastefully put together. I most definitely would order these again. Money well spent! Shipping came as planned.</li>
    <li> Great brush set, nicely packaged!</li>
    <li> I have received this product without charge/discounted price to give my honest opinion on it these that are expressed are my own. Love these!! Love how nice the case is good quality brushes and they are super soft !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. High quality product.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They do have a mild adhesive smell when you open them, but it does dissipate almost immediately.  The box is fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to explain how happy I was when I recieved these in the mail! The case itself screams luxury! The brushes are superb and so soft! I am obsessed with makeup brushes and have MANY! These are amazing! I will absolutely purchase these again for a gift! They look so lovely on my Vanity! Well done!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!  They came in a very nice box and the quality of the brush was great.  Would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set in addition to my other brushes. I actually travel with these as they hold up very well. Shipment was prompt, Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love every last one. The big container it comes in holds all of my brushes now. I achieve the results I desire with these, and absolutely no fibers have been  left on my face.</li>
    <li> Love these make up brushes, wish I had ordered a long time ago!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great …just what i needed ..thank you.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes!</li>
    <li> I have owned way way too many makeup brushes in my life. Ranging from drug store to make up stores to online companies to department stores to popular high end brushes like MAC I have tried just about any brushes I can get my hands on. These brushes are, hands down, some of the best brushes you will ever find and are on par with ANYTHING you will buy from a high end brand (MAC, Bobbi Brown etc.) and IMO are much better than experiences I&#x27;ve had with Sigma brushes. They are better than brushes at sephora (!!!), Ulta, Walmart, and other popular makeup stores.    The brushes are incredibly soft high grade synthetic hair. I normally like a mix between natural and synthetic brushes but you won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between this synthetic hair and soft, natural hair. These brushes are universal as they can be used with powder and also liquid as they won&#x27;t adsorb it. They pick up make up so well and apply it just as well.    The look to these brushes is gorgeous. They have correct length handles, not too long, not too short (about 6 inches including the ferrule). The handles are rock solid and very sleek and have a sort of matte finish which adds to their beauty. The handles of the face brushes are thick and sit very well in your hand. The ferrules are very secure. The brushes are incredibly soft and very dense yet they are incredibly fluffy and each is labeled (I particularly LOVE the powder brush! The stippling brush is also amazing and it is a genuine stippling, easily comparable and as good as my MAC 187). These brushes also come packaged individually and the face brushes have BRUSH GUARDS!! Not the cheap plastic but actual mesh netting brush guards that are very long and fit each brush exactly.    On top of the excellent quality of the brushes is the case. The case is amazing!! It is a rectangular box that splits in the middle and is held together by a very strong magnet. There is plenty of extra room to add other brushes and the case is rock solid and matches the brushes in color. They gold stitching is secure and the case, whether or not it is real leather, could fool anyone.    These are not cheap brushes and it is clear a lot of thought and effort went into these brushes to make them the best they possibly could be. These are professional make up brushes and no matter what brushes you have owned before, whether drug store or MAC, Sigma, Bobbi Brown, you will be impressed with these brushes. The only difference is with these you are not paying the exorbitant amount for a brand name. Guaranteed. Highly recommended. On top of that these brushes have a lifetime guarantee, can&#x27;t go wrong.    On a side note, in the instructions I really appreciate that the company says you do not need to buy an expensive brush cleaner but can just use a mild shampoo (I use baby shampoo) as I have had several moderate to higher end brushes that companies insist you buy their pricey brush cleaner so it&#x27;s very nice the company here isn&#x27;t trying to sell you on that.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush set.  I must say, they are very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these brushes almost every day for the past two months.  The bristles STAY in the brush NOT come off on my face when using them.  In the past, I have purchased makeup brushes that leave extra bristles on my face when I use them.  I have not had this experience AT ALL with these.  This is exactly what I was looking for in a brush set.  I could not be happier.  This was a great purchase and the price was good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes. Well constructed.  Intended to give as a gift now I may keep for myself!</li>
    <li> I love them! I read the reviews before buying them and was glad to see so many good reviews, I had a couple of mac brushes prior to this and they quality is awesome so I was in the market for something like them, without spending a ridiculous amount of money, after looking at every kind of brush possible I came across this and was satisfied with the reviews, and I&#x27;m even more satisfied with the brushes now that I have them, I love the material they&#x27;re soft and smooth and they don&#x27;t leave tiny bristles in my face, it&#x27;s a great product for a great price, I also love the packaging!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I loved how fast they came, How carefully they were packaged! I love the brush guide that explains what each brush is for. The case exceeded my expectations!  Great purchase! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They were delivered promptly and in perfect condition in a nice black leather box. Very high quality brushes. I&#x27;m 100% happy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely perfect. They are so so soft, but the ones that should be dense- are. They do stink like the adhesive when you first open them, BUT that shouldn&#x27;t be something to be upset about. It shows that they used a good amount to hold the hairs. I cleaned them after I opened them and the smell went away and they DID NOT SHED ONE BIT! They pick up my product so well and distribute it evenly. The eyeshadow blending brush blends beautifully and you can forget about a foundation line of demarcation! Love love love these brushes AND the holder they come in! Cheap price, but not cheap quality!</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes at a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Love my brush&#x27;s they have a good handle on them, I like that each brush is marked for how to use it (powder,blush etc)  they are very soft on the face.  Once I washed them when I got them the smell went away from the glue the test will be how they hold up.</li>
    <li> This is really good ! I love it !!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful brushes!!! They arrived quickly, in a beautiful case. Each brush is labeled, and when I use the brushes, my makeup goes on smoothly. I am very pleased &amp; highly recommend!</li>
    <li> “LOVE these brushes. They are very soft and easy to use. I love that they are all labeled. I&#x27;m no make expert but I think they apply my make up flawlessly. .”</li>
    <li> I really like the brush set. The brush is very soft, it can easily make flawless make-up look.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I ordered these brushes due to all the great feedback they&#x27;ve received. This is my first set of brushes so I have nothing to compare them to. However, they seem like a great set--very soft and the bristles are not falling out.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. Need to be washed before use but they apply makeup nicely.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with these brushes and found that they work just as well as my higher end brushes. I took this set and the Crystal Kabuki set with me on my trip to Vegas and my makeup looked flawless. It picked up a good amount of makeup and evenly distributed it throughout my face. They are very soft and easy to work with. I really loved how the brushes looked and how they were labelled. This is definitely a quality product. I washed my brushes before I used them and there was no shedding. The box is very sturdy and the brush guards really helped keep my brushes safe (and in shape) while I was traveling.</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s super soft and works like magic. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as travel brushes for my mineral make-up.  They did not work well for me at all, and I gave the set to a relative who uses a variety of make-up products.  The brushes I use at home are natural hair and are no longer available; these are synthetic and did not hold the product well at all.  The eyeliner brush worked, but that was about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use mineral make-up, I would not recommend you purchase this set.  I will continue to look for a travel set.</li>
    <li> Love my brushes! I was definitely nervous. But as a professional make up artist I think these brushes are awesome for everyday personal use.</li>
    <li> I love the set very professional the brushes are awesome &amp; well packed. I would definitely shop here again.</li>
    <li> I love this set. OMG it touches so smooth and soft, About the smell, it&#x27;s easy to get rid of it once you do deep cleaning. Compared to big brands like Channel, or Dior, they are almost as good as those brands product. So glad I bought this set.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I received 2 powder brush and the stippling brush is not included.</li>
    <li> I got these on Black Friday and they came in a beautiful package and R really soft and have great little detailing brushes in this set but they only lasted me about six months</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  I almost never write reviews, but this product and company deserves one.  About 10 minutes about placing my order, I received a nice email from Candy Sherrill, the Founder of Be You, Beautifully thanking me for the purchase and giving me excellent pointers on the packaging and care of the brushes.  What a nice touch.  I got the set within two days as promised.  The case is large and holds lots more than just these brushes.  The brushes hold and distribute foundation and powder foundation beautifully.  I feel so great using this set - all for the cost of one half of one brush at Sephora!</li>
    <li> nice brushes, use them everyday!</li>
    <li> Very nice and well made. I&#x27;ll be buying more as gifts!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! And the box they come in to keep them is BEAUTIFUL! I have begun using them, but they arrived so fast, I am still awaiting the new makeup I bought to use them with. Customer service is exemplary. They reach out and give you wonderful suggestions to keep and preserve these beautiful brushes. These are a bargain. You won&#x27;t go wrong. I highly recommended the brushes, customer service &amp; company!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described. Very nice quality and variety</li>
    <li> I love my Brushes! They are soft and easy to keep together with the beautiful case. They are also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good for the money. I especially like the angled eye shadow brush. The only caveat I have with the small eye brushes, is that they tug on my eye lids when trying to blend (mature eyes). The larger brushes are very good also. All brushes are fluffy and full. They wash well. I have not seen any shedding at all. I&#x27;ve washed only twice though. The magnetic box is a plus as it holds all my other brushes as well. Over all, these brushes are very good considering what they cost.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes!</li>
    <li> The make-up brushes are great.  They are of excellent quality.  There is a brush for every make-up need.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> “I was really impressed from steps1-10. For the ordering and presentation to the follow up, was great price and quality with an extra brush as a gift.  I am truly satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used MAC brushes then this set is definitely comparable to them. I love these brushes, they&#x27;re soft and literally just as good as MAC brushes that go for $25+ for each brush which is a bit much. These brushes are just as good! I definitely recommend these brushes. You do have to wash them with a gentle shampoo once you receive them because they have the factory smell to them, otherwise there is nothing but good things to say about them.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the quality of these brushes.  Absolutely love them and love that each brush is identified on the handle.  Have paid much more for one brush than I did for all of these.....a mistake I made because I thought the more you paid the better the brush.  NOT TRUE!!!!  The case is also a great addition.  They look fine on my vanity.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush set I have ever owned. You will receive directions on how to clean and disinfect them.  The leather case is beautiful and very sturdy.  If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality brush set at a great price-this brush set is for you!</li>
    <li> athrThese are beautiful brushes. I love the box they come with. Wonderful addition to my makeup tools!</li>
    <li> This order came 4 days after it was place! The packaging was neat and protective. The Brushes had a new, chemical smell but that&#x27;s  to be expected. Just washed with shampoo before use. Each brush is labeled with intended use on the tip of the handles. The blending brush i feel doesn&#x27;t pick up enough product but with the help of any primer it&#x27;s  not to difficult to manage a satisfying look.</li>
    <li> Products are just fine. soft to the touch but does not give me the wow factor. i hate the blush brush as it doesn&#x27;t help apply the blush on my face. The rest of the brushes are fine. Fast delivery. Good customer service and follow up questions.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the most softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever had.  Easy to clean no fall out and perfect size for each makeup process</li>
    <li> Quality make-up brushes at a reasonable price &amp; I love the box they come in. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping them organized.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever owned in my entire life!! Much better than most of my my M.A.C brushes. They bristles do not shed, neither do they have the strong smell of chemicals that some make up brushes do when they are first bought. I love how they are so soft and I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy any of the high end brushes again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are dense and soft. They hold their shape despite their softness. The leather box is stylish and practical. I just wish for one more brush slightly larger. Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the value of this set with any other set in this price range. The contour brush in this set is better than any of the other high end contour brushes I own. The eyeshadow, eyeliner, and blending brushes are also fantastic. I just wish they sold a smaller blending brush because the one they have is a little  too large for precise blending in smaller  areas (I have small asian eyes). The bristles are soft and the case is very classy. I&#x27;ve washed them at least 3-4 times already and have had no issue of fall out at all-which is impeccable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, high quality brushes. Really improve the way my make-up looks/goes on compared with the brushes and sponges, etc. that come with (most of my make-up is Clinique). Great deal. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for about a month and love them.  They come packaged in a elegant storage case that is 2 separate pieces, which makes it nice because I use the other side for my older brushes.  They are very soft and work well for blending.  The stipple brush is a little softer than what I am used to using but it works great.  I would definitely recommend ......great product with awesome price!!</li>
    <li> As a blogger I received this product with a discout for purposes of review. Om my...i love tthese brushes! First the brushes are great quality. So ther is 4 face brushes: Powder Brush, Angeled Blush, which you can also use as a countour brush, foundation and concealer brushes. My fav have to be the Angled one pick up perfect amout of blush and blends it super nice, all the brushes are super soft! Also ther is 4 brushes for your eyes: crease brush, blending and detailed eyeshadow brushes, eyeliner brush.Crease brush is awesome - my fav, brushes are soft and have some firmness at the same time. I&#x27;ve been using these for some time and these do not shed - huge plus in my book. And it also has a stippling brush, whick you can use to put on your foundation or powder. Plus I love love the case it came in, I use it as two, yes not one but 2 containers to store all my brushes: the two parts has a magnetick closer, so it&#x27;s perfect to use as 2 stands.I love this set.</li>
    <li> These are some quality brushes. I love them</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! Great quality and beautiful packaging!</li>
    <li> Just like the other brushes I reviewed, the Be You, Beautifully Crystal Kabuki Collection is the highest quality collection of brushes I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and buy both sets now! They&#x27;re better than Chanel, better than Bare Minerals, and when I wear these out I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  The box that holds the brushes is beautiful and holds together magnetically.  Very classy.  The brushes themselves are of excellent quality.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> i like these brushes i bought them for my friend. Then i got myself a pair as well, they are worth it and they are really good quality</li>
    <li> I am writing this non-biased review in lieu of getting this item at a reduced cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these to my wife and she absolutely love&#x27;s them.  She say&#x27;s she notices her makeup&lt;br /&gt;looks a lot better than what it used to with the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brushes from the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a nice looking leather case and the brushes feel very high quality too.&lt;br /&gt;I even bought another one and sent it to my mom at normal price and she raves about them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!  5/5</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described.  Beautiful brushes and packaging.  Looking forward to trying them out! :)</li>
    <li> These are great brushes and constructed wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Everything about these brushes from the package they come in, to their quality is absolutely amazing! I have been trying to find brushes that are actually worth even trying out and these are some I know I will have in my purse at all times!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few weeks now, and am really happy with them.  At first I was a little intimidated, honestly...I use Bare Escentuals, and have been working with their natural fiber brushes for a long time. These seemed so soft and silky that I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they would work with the product, but it&#x27;s a great change!  I actually did a side-by-side comparison and my application looked pretty much the same, with the exception that these feel amazing on my skin.  I can&#x27;t even touch the harsh natural fiber brushes anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face, I mainly use the powder brush and blush brush, and these two pretty much do everything I need.  The tiny concealer brush is also amazing--I&#x27;ve never had a little one like this, and now I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  It&#x27;s perfect for covering little blemishes without a lot of product and without getting big cakey areas of coverage where you don&#x27;t need that.  I do continue to use my old concealer brush under my eyes--there I do want a larger area of coverage, so I find it easier to do that evenly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the foundation brush at all since I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, and I haven&#x27;t found a use for the stippling brush either--that may be doable for mineral makeup, I just haven&#x27;t experimented enough yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are also fantastic.  The eyeliner brush works perfectly for wet-dry powder liner application, and also for applying eyeshadow along my lower lash line.  The fibers are kind of long and soft, so it might not work so well with a thick cream or gel liner.  The liquid liners I use have a brush built-in, so I haven&#x27;t tried it there, but I imagine it would be perfect for liquid as well.  The other eye brushes are fantastic as well, and I find myself playing with eye makeup a whole lot more now that I have the tools to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that the set came with brush guards--those are something I know are important, but probably never would have bothered to buy, purely out of laziness.  The box is also very nice, although a little too big for the way that I travel.  Great for at home, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would definitely recommend this set.  I see a lot of reviews from makeup professionals, which says a lot, but I think it&#x27;s also an amazing choice for a non-professional who might be a little intimidated by what on earth to buy.  I&#x27;ve definitely never owned any brushes as nice as these before, and for me having a whole set of the best (and best quality) at one time is fantastic...takes a lot of the guesswork away!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Be You Beautifully brushes set a couple of weeks ago and after using them I&#x27;m in love! Make up done to perfection! No lines or brush strokes, excellent blending, excellent make up packing without eyeshadow all over your face. This set is very afordable. You will be getting top quality brushes for a fraction of the cost of renouwed brand name ones. The brushes are super nice, nicer than I anticipated. This set brings 8 brushes plus a stippling brush as a bonus. The brushes are super soft and dense. The handles are long and thick and very comfortable to handle. I love the way they look and how well made they are. The brushes came in a rectangular, leather like, magnetic case which I love. It is a larger case than other sets I have owned and I appreciate that. Brushes came individually wrapped and the larger ones even come with brush guards (perfect for after washing, reshaping and protecting the brushes). Each brush comes with its usage printed on them. With the package you also receive a brochure with pictures of the brushes and an explanation of what it is used for (perfect for beginners like me). After ordering and as soon as the package was shipped out I received an email from the company founder with tips and instructions of how to clean, disinfect and care for the bushes. This company is a family owned company and after reading a little on their background I truly appreciate the product they have created and how much they care for their customers. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I&#x27;m very glad I decided to order this set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping for makeup brushes for about a year now, and these brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I&#x27;m so pleased with these brushes!  They are high quality, and this perfect for anyone looking for a nice set of professional makeup brushes. I got tI ordered my brushes on Saturday, and I got them Tuesday afternoon. I&#x27;ve been shopping for makeup brushes for about a year now, and these brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased! he discount code,  so I got these brushes for a complete steal! There really is no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t buy these brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist in LA - Myself and my clients love these brushes. I love the way they get the job done, which is &amp;#34;Be-You-fully&amp;#34; ;-) And my clients love how they feel! I will definitely purchase again. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They are so soft and make applying makeup effortless.  They case they come in is of great quality.</li>
    <li> I love this brush kit! The brushes are of very good quality and are so soft. When I purchased this, I thought it was such a good price, as many brushes can easily be $40 for ONE. When I received it I was so excited to find out there was a NINTH bonus brush and the packaging was above par. Each brush is labeled which I thought was so helpful! I used the box it comes in to display my brushes on my counter. I just added some small pebbles to it and it perfectly holds my brushes upright to keep them in good condition and easily accessible. HIGHLY recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this elegant,well-made brush set. I sat down and practiced using each one and the quality did not disappoint. Each one has a specific purpose. I like the way the angled blush brush applied the color more deeply in the hollow and then allowed for a seamless blending out. The concealer brush did the same thing when I used it to cover under eye circles and blemishes- there were no edges and the coverage was complete. The shadow brushes work specifically for all-over the lid or to build intensity in the recessed areas for depth and definition. You will love these super-soft brushes in their classy keeper case.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Very great quality that allow you to blend your make-up perfectly and achieve your desired look! The traveler&#x27;s box they come is also super convenient for storing your brushes or taking them on the go! For all of you who love doing make-up, whether you prefer a natural look or bold one, I definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> I have used these product a couple of times and washed them too.  These are the best brushes I have ever owned.  They do not shed at all.  They are firm enough to give good application, yet so soft.  I cannot believe i lived without these brushes.  This makes my makeup look airbrushed.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I just received these brushes and was so impressed. The bristles are very soft and yet keep their shape nicely. The best part is all the brushes are labeled on the handle. This is great for us &#x27;beginners&#x27; who need to know which brush would be best. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to using these.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love love the brushes!  Everything about them - they&#x27;re so soft and even the packaging is beautiful.  I am so excited about them and would highly recommend them to anyone.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. Great service!</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes in the mail earlier today, and I am already blown away by the quality! I also love that they come with brush cozies to keep your brushes lasting even longer! I cannot wait to use these everyday now! Thank you so much for the brushes, I will be telling all my friends!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed I&#x27;ve had better brushes cheaper</li>
    <li> These were bought as a gift for my sister-in-law. She loves trying different makeup and brushes because she changes her makeup to match outfits and seasons. These arrived yesterday and they look very professional. The handles are have a pretty golden satin finish and the bristles are white at the tips giving the user a better idea of how much makeup they&#x27;ve applied to avoid wasting makeup. I really like the black leather container the brushes are stored in as well. I know she&#x27;ll love this gift! I&#x27;ll update this review once she opens it.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my girl and she was happy that I paid attention to her when she said she needed some new makeup and brushes. She&#x27;d ben using some old brushes that she picked up at a drug store and has had them forever. She opened up this box and felt like she was given a makeup artist&#x27;s secret stash of tools.&lt;br /&gt;She Loves Them! &amp;#34;What a difference!&amp;#34; I guess you don&#x27;t realize how much you put up with so-so tools until you get a fresh set of quality ones. Hmmm...guess I better hint at some new power tools to her. Ha&lt;br /&gt;She says everything goes on so smooth and even. No having to go over and fix spots like with the old brushes. Happy girlfriend means happy life for me. I will be paying attention to her subtle suggestions even more in the future. ;)</li>
    <li> Gorgeous brush set! I have been using for a couple weeks now, and have been very pleased with the quality. I also appreciate how each brush is labeled with it&#x27;s intended use for those of us who are not makeup professionals :) Great purchase!</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes. I think everyone should try them!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set. The brushes are very high quality and they&#x27;re great for a beginner.</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW 12/5/2014: I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few weeks now, and I can&#x27;t reiterate enough of how much I love them! These have become a staple in my makeup routine. A few of them has even replaced my Mac brushes. Each brush beautifully, picks up product! I love that I don&#x27;t have to wash these after every use in order to get a flawless application. They perform amazingly, even after a spot clean. They are also very multi-tasking! The powder brush applies mineral, pressed, baked, ...seamlessly! I use the stippling brush to blend out contour and for the use of translucent loose powder. I have yet to use the foundation brush for its specified use; instead, I use it to buff out my concealer. The shading brush is prefect for baked shadows.    Now, for the best part; the Pageant Queen of this parade...The blending brush!! My, oh my...I am in absolute LOVE!!!!!!! This blending brush has given my Mac 217 a run for its money. No freaking kidding! It is AWESOME!!! (This reminds me of Elaine&#x27;s overuse of exclamation marks in that one Seinfeld espisode) Okay, back on track...honestly, this blending brush is just awesome. I love the fact that I have yet to experience shedding, unlike my Mac 217. The highlight point of this brush, is the way it blends product into the crease. Double Whoa!! It blends it to the point that you cannot tell where one color ends and the other begins. Boy, oh boy...this little lady can blend! Another advantage is the way this baby picks up product; So a light hand is needed. This is the best tool to use for a smoky eye. Best purchase ever! (Sigh)    ORIGINAL REVIEW: Oh my gosh, amazing brushes! I absolutely love the brush holder. A bit spacious, which isn&#x27;t at all bad, because I can include additional brushes.  As for the brushes...they&#x27;re incredibly soft and the workmanship on these tools definitely shows. They&#x27;re very well tapered and sleek. Honestly, I wish there were additional brushes, however, I digress! Delivery took about 3 days after purchase date.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought some brushes that werent from WalMart, and SO happy with these!  High quality, easy to use, beautiful kit.  I should have done this a long time ago!  I love them.  Now, if I could just find decent, blendable eyeshadow that actually deposits color!!!</li>
    <li> Best brushes ive ever used!</li>
    <li> Love these! They came in the mail so fast!</li>
    <li> I got it in time. Great brushes, first time buying brushes that are not super cheap (dollar store). I haven&#x27;t used them yet, i loved the case in which they came in. The brushes feel soft, but however just one little comment, I expected the stippling brush to be a little more sturdy for stippling, however it was a bonus brush so with that aside, I am very pleased with this product.Thank you for seller for making these brushes such an affordable price. I will be updating on how these brushes worked out when putting them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m saving them for halloween face makeup.</li>
    <li> I really required quality brushes. This set is wonderful , no shedding on your face and each brush is labeled for correct use Very pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Love them and they work great&amp;#34; </li>
    <li> Not only do these brushes look good, they also work great. Love how soft the bristles are.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set!  It is by far the best I have ever owned.  They come in a beautiful leather case that seals magnetically.  Perfect for a gift.  The brushes are excellent!  I find that all the shapes I need are in this set.  I also love the mesh shape covers.  Each brush is labeled for the beginner as well.  This company thought of everything.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I heard about these brushes from a friend. I received them yesterday (in a very timely manner) and used them this morning. They are by far the softest brushes I have owned. My makeup went on smoothly and flawlessly (without leaving any brush marks or bristles behind). I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a quality set of makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredibly high quality brushes. Each brush is labeled and they come in the prettiest magnetic storage box. There is a pamphlet explaining how to use each brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these would make a perfect gift for Christmas, Mother&#x27;s Day, etc. They are reasonably priced for what they are. I think anyone would get plenty of use out of these.</li>
    <li> First professional brushes ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;Makeup applies well.</li>
    <li> First off I love the box they came in, its very sturdy and seems like it&#x27;s made very well. Secondly, I love the brushes themselves. They are very soft and sturdy. I also love the fact that they have the names of what they are on the handle, its very convenient. Their service is also wonderful. They sent the time to send me an email about how best to care for and clean my brushes. Really great!</li>
    <li> Great service and products</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, great packaging (comes in a leather bound magnetic case) and the brush hair is extremely soft. I love that each brush is individually labeled - perfect for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t know what each brush is for.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, and it comes with a nice case.</li>
    <li> The packaging is amazing! The box is magnetic! Perfect for traveling! The brushes themselves are so soft and so gentle on the face. Love them!</li>
    <li> Good quality, feel great on your skin. Wish the box provided was a little more updated in it&#x27;s look but the brushes themselves are awesome.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Great!</li>
    <li> Great brushes ever .....Beautiful set and so luxurious !!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the quality of these brushes. I love them, and they cost me a fraction of what I spent on my last set from sephora.</li>
    <li> Nice quality brushes - would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful set. I am very pleased with the assortment and quality of these brushes. Would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> These make up brushes are beautiful and beautifully packaged. I live the magnetic case that they come in to keep them safe from dirt and just hanging out in a dirty make up bag. I love that they are cruelty free and are made by a family business. I am giving these to my make up crazy niece for Christmas and I am sure she will freak out for them!</li>
    <li> I received these brushes and did FLAWLESS wedding makeup just two days later! Not only do  brushes make a HUGE difference when you&#x27;re applying your makeup, but the product guide makes these brushes great for beginners as well. I will definitely order these brushes again!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes as my first set of makeup brushes, and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality, especially given the reasonable price. Very soft brushes, comfortable on the face, and easy to control. I especially like that the brushes are labeled, which really helps me know how to use each of them. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Would suggest that everyone have one of these!!!</li>
    <li> Work as described. Very nice brushes that comes in a very nice and elegant looking box ...this is my first set of brushes ever so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to. They are worth every penny</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I&#x27;ve used the brushes enough to give a proper feedback. I&#x27;ve owned this set since the end of March 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting from the delivery, they arrived earlier than expected. The brushes came packed nicely in a beautiful black box, the brushes feel soft and of great quality. I&#x27;ve washed them several times and I haven&#x27;t had a single hair falling off even after 2 months of use. The case has gone through several 12+ hours traveling journeys and it is still intact, no smell and it still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed the brushes are excellent, they give me a natural look and when needed also sophisticated. I bought a brush cleaner spray and it leaves them like new every time I use it. So I&#x27;m very happy with them. I will only wish there was and angle brow brush in this set. The brushes are soft enough to apply the make up properly and I love the fact that they&#x27;re named as I&#x27;m not a make up expert and it helps not to get confused between brushes. I love that they all came with their own brush guard, which I&#x27;m still using every day and I believe it&#x27;s a great detail to keep your brushes in shape all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, their customer service is above expectations and any questions or concerns I had were taken care of immediately!</li>
    <li> best. brushes. ever. cool case. i like labels on each brush. buy them. treat yourself. your makeup will look even better  you&#x27;re so pretty anyway.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful premium makeup brush set.  I was so impressed with the exceptional quality of the brushes at such an amazing price.  Absolute makeup perfection.  You better believe I will be recommending these to my friends and purchasing these as gifts...in fact most my friends will be getting this set for Christmas.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the product arrived 1 day later than expected...but I think it was because of the holidays.    Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!! Great variety of brushes and they all work very well.</li>
    <li> They are great!  They are firm but yet soft.  I love the case they came in to keep them in that great condition.</li>
    <li> all I have to say is omg, especially the stippling brush, it&#x27;s a big bonus flawless finish just use that and my beauty blender for flawless foundation.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. Good choice for daughters that love makeup</li>
    <li> excellent! every woman should own this brush set.</li>
    <li> i never write reviews on my purchases, but this one is different. I love the brushes. I&#x27;ve bought plenty online that I was totally not pleased with. These I totally love. I use it everyday. Shipping took awhile but that was the only con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally 100% recommend this.</li>
    <li> Just received these today.  They are of top quality and looking forward to suing them for a long time! The holder is also awesome.</li>
    <li> happy me l this butba lot if brush i cant use</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful.  I cannot stress enough the high quality of these brushes compared to other high end brands like MAC, Sephora, etc.  I love that each brush is labeled and the case is heavy and beautiful and you can use it as a brush holder.  I received a discount for trying out this product.</li>
    <li> I was happily surprised at the quality of these brushes when I received them! I also love the nice case that they came in</li>
    <li> these makeup brushes are very nice. There is a variety of brushes for your entire face in this set. The brushes are very well made and the bristles are secure. I&#x27;m confident they will not fall out even after lots of use and a few cleanings. They are a  nice length so they are easy to use. The angled brushes are prefect to get in the creases.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft but easy to use.  The set includes a Powder Brush, angled Blush, foundation, concealer brush,  crease brush, blending and detailing eyeshadow brushes, and an eyeliner brush. The liner brush and crease brushes are my favorite. The crease brush is perfect to experiment with eye shadow. It creates defined lines and gets in the creases with precision. Use the blending brush to finish the look and you have  a job that looks professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;There is a pamphlet included with descriptions of the brushes and what they are used for. The brushes are also labeled discreetly so you don&#x27;t have to reference the pamphlet once you are familiar with the way the brushes are used.&lt;br /&gt;The case is what is amazing! The case is a soft faux leather material. It is very well made, the stitching is amazing. It has a magnetic close so all I have to do is put the two pieces together and they connect. There is no fighting to make sure it&#x27;s snapped. The case is square and compact but huge on the inside. It would easily hold more than these eight brushes.  It can be put together for travel or apart it is 2 separate containers in turn making it hold more.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
    <li> The brushes are wonderful. I like being able to choose which brush to use for whatever I&#x27;m using: face powder, blush, eye color, etc. And the container they come in is so nice and keeps them all organized. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I am SO excited to get my hands on these brushes!  I have been waiting for them to launch on September 1 and it&#x27;s right around the corner!!  I will be following up with another review as soon as I try them out.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist in Manhattan NY, and finding a comprehensive set of brushes is tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for some thing I could exclusively use and be able to send my makeup clients towards for their personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be you, Beautifully is my total coverage solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so so gentle on the skin across the board. They hold their product super well which is a major issue to me (not having excess eye makeup dust all over the face! Or powder on clothes). I love the size and shape of each brush. You can tell the designer really listened to what professionals want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision of the smaller eye brushes is just unbeatable. I love every single one! I&#x27;ll never be able to get buy without them now. I&#x27;m hooked! I can&#x27;t wait to see what brush may come out next!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get your set AND amazing stylish holder today while the fantastic stippler brush (one of my favorites) is included!</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing, and the packaging is exquisite!!  I am more than pleased with how they perform in applying my makeup and would definitely, definitely buy again from this seller.</li>

    <li> Soft Brushes they pick up color really good. I love the case its magnetic perfect for traveling. I&#x27;m enjoying these brushes very much. :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gift for my sister, who is in her mid-30s and is actually went to school for cosmetics. I went with this product, and WHAT A HIT it was! The packaging is beautiful, I did not even want to wrap it... She absolutely loves the set, and says these are the best brushes she has ever owned! Could not be happier with this purchase, and will buy again!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! The quality is better than anything I&#x27;ve used before and they&#x27;re so soft. I love them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They quality is exceptional for the price you pay. I have replaced the brushes I paid much more for.with these. You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece and myself. We both love them!! They are the nicest brushes I have ever owned. Sturdy, well made and no shedding. The company is awesome and sent me an email on how to clean the brushes. Highly recommend. If you are on the fence, do not think and just buy!</li>
    <li> I received the package in perfect condition and well within the expected time.  The brush container looks very nice and is quite useful.  I have used only one of the brushes so far and am happy with its performance.  I use the brush to apply bronzer and it works well, the material does not get absorbed and lost in the brush head, and is spread evenly on my skin.  Looking forward to using the other pieces.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an inexpensive, high quality makeup brush set for awhile and these are perfect. I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Great purchase! I&#x27;m no professional but I&#x27;m really enjoying these brushes.  They pick up product nice, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s soaking it so I&#x27;m not wasting product.  The handles are nice and labeled too! You get a really nice case that is grest for storing or displaying. Over all great purchase will recommend to others!</li>
    <li> In spit of having some little problems with container of brushes, I am giving 5 star. The brushes are very good quality and soft. Also shipping was fast and customer service was excellent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic set, especially for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wary of buying these since I have never heard of the company, but I am so glad I did!  I have brushes from Sephora, Japonesque, Real Techniques, Laura Gellar, Haikuhodo, and Urban Decay and these brushes can easily hold their own or outperform the big name brushes. I find myself reaching for these brushes quite a bit, and they are easily of comparable quality to much more expensive brushes.  In particular, I like the powder brush and the eye blending brush.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Way cool box for brushes. Brushes are nice. Very happy with this purchase. Used to buy brushes from Mac. Not anymore.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes and came in a nice box.  Came quickly and are individually marked for their use.</li>
    <li> Best Brushes I have ever Bought! Changed my makeup look to smooth and blended. :)</li>
    <li> This makeup brush set really is top of the line! I love the close-able leather case that comes with it. Each brush was wrapped and neatly put together so none of the brushes got messed up before I got them. The brushes themselves are thick and high quality. None of the hairs come loose or fall out while using them. I&#x27;ve used brushes that were supposed to be top of the line high quality that don&#x27;t even stack up to how awesome these brushes are. The assortment in brushes is amazing and any makeup job you have you are guaranteed to have a brush to get the job done right. I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Wonderful quality and packaged very nicely for storage</li>
    <li> I love - love - these brushes! I just had to buy my mom a set for Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these brushes, I now have a flawless look. The brushes really do make a difference.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the high level of quality of every aspect of these brushes. Each brush is labeled for its intended purpose, individually wrapped, and the bigger brushes even have pouches to keep the bristles in place. The brushes came with instructions for the initial wash and continued care to keep them in great condition. I am excited to continue using them daily!</li>
    <li> Brushes were very nice and order came quickly and was well worth it &#x3D;) it came in a a very nice box and can be used and would be great as a nice gift to someone</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Beautiful brushes, and the cleaning instructions were most appreciated. &amp;#34;</li>

    <li> These brushes are lovely and very high quality.  I really like that each brush has the name of what it should be used for on the handles.  I also appreciated the email from the seller with instructions on cleaning the brushes. Very impressive seller and product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far so good...what can I say I have been using this product since I received it In the mail, shipped fast,works great and great quality,I will defiantly be ordering from this seller.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Be You, Beautifully set of makeup brushes.  They came in a sturdy and beautiful leather case, and most of the set of 8 had a protective woven netting to support them when they dry after cleaning.  Initially I was trying to figure out which brush worked for what purpose, and matched which picture in the enclosed brochure.  Then I noticed that each brush is clearly labeled as to its use.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very fine and soft, yet also substantial enough for the task at hand.  I have been using the basic eye and makeup kits from Bare Escentuals which come with their own brushes, so I have been transitioning from these to the much finer and more varied set of Be You, Beautifully brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I found some instructional DVDs on You Tube, and the BYB site, and Allison, the professional makeup artist, gave lots of introductory information, and said the brushes were cruelty free, which is important to me.  She has videos on using concealer and foundation with the brushes as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the company is family owned, and the owner was inspired by her four daughters.  This is the kind of business I feel good about supporting with my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;My one comment would be about the ease of transporting the brushes.  The leather case is a bit on the heavy side so it would depend on where I was travelling and by what mode whether I would take them or not.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! So soft and have a pretty great application. You&#x27;d think you just spent TONS of money for super high end brushes, but in reality hardly spend anything!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves them.  Very glad I purchased these and will recommend them to my friends.  Thank you for making her one happy girl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes, this is a lovely, affordable set for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying these brushes!</li>
    <li> I got these for my birthday and they are great!&lt;br /&gt;High quality.</li>
