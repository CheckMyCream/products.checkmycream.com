<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quality product with natural Bristals.  Used them for many years.</li>
    <li> This is a nice stiff brush. I have been looking for a brush like this for several years. I have been buying them and hating them once I get them home...they always end up much to soft. This is a firm brush, I have only had it for a day, but it is exactly what I have been looking for. I almost feel like buying at least another, because I never want to have to look again or waste money on junky brushes again.</li>
    <li> This Skin Brush duo is awesome.  I didn&#x27;t realize the benefit of having a long handle brush AND a hand held.  The bristles are perfect too, not too course, not too soft, they&#x27;re just right.  Trust me this is the best deal around!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliating brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel softer and not as dry feeling surprisingly!</li>
    <li> Love the stimulation of dry brushing! The brush isn&#x27;t too soft or too stiff.</li>
    <li> It was a mistake to order them.  I didn&#x27;t even realize when I went off that Blog I was ordering until it was too late.</li>
    <li> This skin brush is rough on the skin at the initial start of use, however, that is normal. You will get use to it! I love dry skin brushing in the morning. Sometime I even do it at night as well.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner. I am pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I try and use this a few times a week, not sure if dry brushing really works but like the feeling if nothing else I&#x27;m getting rid of dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> These are the best! You can use them as a dry brush or get them wet... Cannot beat this price...2 for $12. Do not buy these anywhere else. They make a great hostess gift...stocking stuffer...or just treat yourself! FYI...Some of my Yoga friends glue the handle into position. I have never glued them and do not have a problem</li>
    <li> I love this skin brush!!  After the very first use, as I showered I could immediately tell my skin was softer!  It felt smoother...with my normal body moisturizer my skin is feeling soft and moisturized all day!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> was very pleased to receive the two long handle brushes at a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;they work great for dry brushing</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush! I use it daily. Such a good purchase, and what a great deal as a pack of 2!</li>
    <li> After only a few days my skin feels healthier.  The brushes are well crafted and I enjoy having a handle that is removable, but sturdy when i need it!  I thought a specialized product would be more expensive- but I can tell I won&#x27;t need to replace these any time soon. . . maybe not ever!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!</li>
    <li> These were way too rough for me.</li>
    <li> Do not, I repeat, do not waste your money on any other skin brush, period! This order makes it my 5th &amp; 6th brushes, since discovering them in 2012. After replacing it for my loofa, I use one with the handle and the other without. They will last up to a year, depending on frequency of use and pressured applied during use. Always allow to dry completely between use, so if necessary purchase the 2 pack, which are less expensive than buying one at a time. I have gone through countless inferior brushes about 40 years before discovering these.</li>
    <li> These body brushes are really nice and good quality for the price. It is also great that you get 2 in a pack. I have enjoyed using them!</li>
    <li> Love it for serious exfoliation. I see blemishes and bruises and scars disappear. My skin is tighter and glowing</li>
    <li> Nice, sturdy brush.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Love the skin brush which I use along with the Sesame oil.</li>
    <li> I dry brush a couple times a week and love this brush. I put my own string on it so I could hang it in my shower. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Bought the two pack for the price of one. They are firm but not too firm. Perfect</li>
    <li> Feels great when I use it, I like the quality of the brush, I like that it is agave/tampico/maguey fibers, I like the aesthetics. I tied a loop to the hole, it gives me more &amp;#34;reach&amp;#34; and allows me to hang up the brush. Highly recommended, makes a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;- High quality construction&lt;br /&gt;- Natural plant fibers&lt;br /&gt;- Hole on end of brush allows space to loop on a string, if you have multiple brushes in your home, use different colors of twine.&lt;br /&gt;-Tying on a loop give me more reach when brushing my back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product at a great price, I bought extras to give as gift to health-loving friends.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brush before and the quality then was exceptional. Now the brush constantly slides off the handle and boy does it hurt if it hits your toes. The brush itself is very exfoliating.</li>
    <li> very nice quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this!  My massage therapist recommended dry brushing to improve lymphatic drainage.  The bristles are just right...not too harsh, but invigorating.  My skin has never been smoother - bonus!</li>
    <li> This my second review, so my update.  I do like this brush and it has worked well, however after two washings I have two empty bristle wells where the entire bristle plug has fallen out.  Disappointing</li>
    <li> Love my brush, i have used it about 5 times and my skin feels amazing! Even after only one brushing i could feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dry brush, having started out using the brush that I used for showering. Upon the recommendation of a mentor, I looked for a Tampico skin brush and found this one. the Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush is perfect for my dry-brushing needs - not too hard, not too soft. Having had dry-brushing done before and winding up with scratches on my (somewhat delicate) skin, I can say that this one is just right for me. My favorite aspect is that the handle is detachable, allowing me to use just the brush head on the easily-reached places, but quickly being able to switch to the handled version for places like my back.</li>
    <li> Well built brushes, durable bristles, nice quality, great price!</li>
    <li> Good price and quick shipping.  Great experience.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a wonderful way to keep skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t experienced these, you will be surprised at how wonderful they feel.  This is a brush for DRY use on skin, and it has just the right abrasiveness.  I&#x27;ve bought these for years and years, and anyone I try them on thinks that it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought these mainly because of the price. I&#x27;m sure they have their uses, but these are *not* the everyday shower brush that you&#x27;re used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Ow! Now, I&#x27;ve been scrubbed down by muscled Moroccan women in public baths, but this is a whole new level of clean. Remember in Gattaca when Ethan Hawke scrubbed his skin raw everyday? He would&#x27;ve liked these. The bristles are tough/strong...not sure how to describe them, but you must be gentle, unless you like that raw new baby feel. *Definitely* do not use these on your children.&lt;br /&gt;2) The bristles are set into holes in the wood with what must be a water-based adhesive, because over the last two weeks I&#x27;ve lost 3 &amp;#34;tufts&amp;#34; of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;3) The wood is untreated and will absorb water (and keep it there)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish these had worked out. For such a simple object the usual prices (I think) are silly. Unless you&#x27;re using these to brush your horse, or are a leathery construction worker, I can&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> love this for dry brushing</li>
    <li> Great Skin Brush.  Love it!  The price can&#x27;t be beat and the quality is A+</li>
    <li> This brush feels wonderful.  The only thing that I would add is a hand strap to the bush to hold in my hand without the jeopardy of it falling other than that I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great value and very coarse.  These brushes were shipped quickly and were exactly what i was looking for when I wanted to purchase dry brushes.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love that we can adjust the brush.</li>
    <li> I love my Yerba Prima dry brush!</li>
    <li> I have been using my skin brushes for about a month and I am so impressed with this product. I had another skin brush that I used for several years.  I wish I had replaced in a long time ago, because this product is superior.  Great materials and because I travel quite a bit, the ability to remove the handle is very helpful.  Once the handle is on, it is very stable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are the dry brushes that my husband and I use - you can also find them in Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little stiff in the beginning, but they are perfect for dry brushing!!</li>
    <li> I love using these brushes for dry skin brushing.  Yes the bristles are firm and you have to get used to it.  They will soften over time.  I love the stiffness of the bristles My body feels great after using them.  My skin looks flawless, even toned and radiant.  thanks for making such a great body brush at such a reasonable price.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Have not used it yet but it looks sturdy.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Bought some for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have psoriasis and have a lot of skin shedding when it breaks out really bad. I have used the brush and it does get a lot of the dead skin off. The bristles are not too harsh to use but they are stiff enough to do the job. Bought an extra which I may give as a gift.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.  Use on a daily basis and I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
    <li> I love the Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush (pack of 2)  I bought one for myself and one for my husband.  He looked at me and said what did you buy now.  Once he tried the brush he loved it also, and is using it daily.  I have already recommended this brush to family and friends.  It leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed.  I feel it so relaxing.  I will definitly buy again.  Shipping from this seller was fast and arrived in perfect condition.  I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> Works well, bristles stay in place, handle is of adequate length; could be longer. It isn&#x27;t to heavy so use is easy. Bristles stiff enough to exfoliate well without really damaging skin.  If you&#x27;re new to dry brushing using this the first few times will be painful; the endorphin rush is pretty great though.</li>
    <li> The photo on Amazon shows one brush without a handle and one brush that looks as if the handle is attached. I received two detached brushes and two detached handles. When you attach the handle to the brush, it does not seem very secure. It is long and thin, and it feels like it will snap or detach if too much pressure is put on it. When it comes time to replace my brush, I will look for a one-piece product (which is what I thought I was buying here) with a slightly shorter, sturdier handle. As for quality of the brush itself, it seems fine after just a couple of uses. This product was a good price and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my skin feeling baby soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Being new to skin brushing, I am so happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> We have bought them before and will buy them again.  Very good quality.  Those who have had bad experiences with brushes breaking ... it happens, it is a natural product made from wood ... it can split, that&#x27;s all there is to it.  Glue it back together and get on life.  They last for years!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine Wish there was a similar one with softer bristles for the face.</li>
    <li> Great help for reaching areas beyond upper front for me.  I use a smaller brush for my face and neck, but have some limited mobility with my dominant hand that this works well for.</li>
    <li> It works great I love it... :)</li>
    <li> good product, love how hard and solid this is. Its already my 4th brush. Loving them and use them all the time.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. I read about them on a blog and decided to try it. I like that it exfoliates without putting chemicals on my skin. And it feels great like a mini massage and it stimulates your skin. After my shower I dry off and apply organic sesame oil and I&#x27;m baby soft all day! I live in a very dry climate and this is a huge help to my skin. Go for it - it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Well constructed firm bristles, this is a great skin brush. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So quick ! It is exactly what I was looking for!! Highly recommended product and company!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  I use them both dry and in the shower - with the handle and without.  Like them so much that this time I bought two so I would have one to take while travelling.  They last a long time, and the bristles stay firm (while being soft enough to use dry). Very nice, quality product.</li>
    <li> it is harsher than I expected.</li>
    <li> Very rough bristles. Couldn&#x27;t use because the bristles hurt my skin.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered promptly and I was very excited. BUT, while the brush itself is great, the handle doesn&#x27;t stay on so if you&#x27;re buying this to reach those unreachable places, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this item here.  This is the best body brush around and the price here was so reasonable.</li>
    <li> Nice strong bristles, good size, good price.</li>
    <li> Great body brushes. The two pack provided one for me and one to share with my daughter!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price!  All natural without the synthetic plastic found on some body brushes.  I highly recommend!  Plus they have a multi-pack discount.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Stiff bristles make for an invigorating rub down!</li>
    <li> Great body brushes with detachable handles.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> No String but these seem well made!</li>
    <li> Recently started dry brushing as part of my overall health regime, and this brush is perfect for that purpose.  Additionally, the handle makes it easy to reach the back without straining.  Very solid product.</li>
    <li> quick shipment, quality brushes</li>
    <li> Even after the 1st use I real felt a difference! Very invigorating! :)</li>
    <li> Delivered as indicated, great product!</li>
    <li> Good quality brush with a handle you can install or not which was not clear to me in the ad but is easy to install and quite sturdy.  I can see that it would be fine to use the brush without the handle other than trying to reach your back - but, hey, you receive two sets!</li>
    <li> Really softens my skin</li>
    <li> Nice brush, well made. I like that it can be used with or without the long handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Yerba Prima for years as a shower brush but only recently realized that the best results are achieved by scrubbing the skin before showering.  The feeling is great and the brush will last longer by not being exposed to soap and water, other than routine cleaning.  This brush is not for you if you are a wimp or have sensitive or delicate skin.  But if you love a good scrubbing and enjoy having clean, healthy skin, buy two!</li>
    <li> I have very rough and dry skin. So these brushes help a lot. They keep my skin very soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> have been using it for couple months now and like how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Been using these brushes for years.  Much better than a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s really not so rough that it hurts, but I did work my way up to brushing it harder just in case my sensitive skin reacted adversely to it. But it feels so good! It&#x27;s like scratching unknown itchy spots. My skin does look better, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the brush or rhe combination of other tgings I am doing. But this does feel good and I do see dry skin flakes fall off as I brush.</li>
    <li> Great product. The brush is easy to use and the removable handle is convenient for travel. My skin feels softer and I could see better skin results in three days. I use the brush before showering and then put on organic sesame oil.</li>
    <li> Brush is very rough.  Wood cracked the second time it got wet. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Using this brush as the website suggests makes my skin tingle!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product works exceptionally well. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, haven&#x27;t used yet but they would like a review, so I will have to do so at a later date after I have tried it out&lt;br /&gt;brush is not too hard or to soft should be just right to use on skin. handle removes when you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth one. I dry brush offer and these are the best.</li>
    <li> I use it for dry brushing. I&#x27;m new to it so I thought it was a bit harsh at first but it really isn&#x27;t. I saw a marked improvement in how dry my skin was. I&#x27;ve read that it minimizes cellulite but I haven&#x27;t seen that at all. Perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but I&#x27;m not holding my breath for such miracle.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Just the right firmness and feels fantastic. Would recommend. I actually even gave the second one to my mother to try.</li>
    <li> Love dry skin brushing with these!!!</li>
    <li> A must for the dry skin brush users</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! Perfect for dry brushing, the bristles are hard enough to get the work done, yet not rough so that it hurts your skin. Love em!</li>
    <li> Great Product! I bought the two pack and was surprised! I did not realize that the handheld brush become the back brush by simply inserting the handle into the back of the brush. I must admit though, I was so excited about a body brush that I did not completely read the product description. But hey! now I have an extra brush. This brush is wonderful! It is durable, reliable and definitely gets the job done. If you are new to dry brushing like I was, the bristles are slightly uncomfortable at first and leave minimal scratches but you quickly get used to roughness and brushing no longer &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34;. The pressure you apply plays a huge role in the comfort or discomfort of brushing. I did not feel sick the first time I dry brushed. Some people report a sick feeling during/shortly after dry brushing as a result of the lymph moving. They say this feeling typically subsides after 5 minutes or so. On day 2 after dry brushing and 3 Hot/Cold cycles in the shower, my skin felt super super soft and comfortable and even if that was the only benefit of dry brushing I would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and will continue to do so. Removes dead skin and promotes circulation. Use it before the bath or shower to loosen dry and old skin. Also helps bring circulation to back of legs and arms and lymph system. I have tried other brushes and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the handle design. It&#x27;s not ergo and not really useful for me but the brush itself is super and thankfully you can remove the handle, which is what I&#x27;ve done. :)</li>
    <li> This is pretty heavy duty,feels so good in the shower. I drilled a small hole in it and used a piece of tooth pic to keep the handle on.It handled the problem .</li>
    <li> Great skin sluffing brush at an unbelievable price!!  (The spas want to charge you between $40-$45 dollars for the same exact thing).  Just brush lightly over your skin to remove all the dryness, and then once you&#x27;ve showered, your skin feels completely different... renewed!</li>
    <li> I like the brush, but the handle does not stay on.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality item, and I&#x27;m glad that I chose it.  Be aware that the bristles are not very soft and flexible, so you need to dry brush very gently.</li>
    <li> Good pair of brushes. A bit firm but once you get used to it, its great! Only thing is there&#x27;s a funny scent to the bristles, even after washing it so you may have to store it in a sealed bag or something. Quality of brush thoughis good....</li>
    <li> I love these. It makes my skin feel very soft and relieves the itching from detox.</li>
    <li> Bristles are rough so if you are very sensitive, these might not be for you. Or only use on lower body.</li>
    <li> excellent brushes, not too hard for the skin (still, it has to be somewhat effective, so understand it is not silk hair either). All wood and hair, no plastic part. Looks like it will last some time.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Well made</li>
