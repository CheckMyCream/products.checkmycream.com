<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This set is a nice starter set, but it&#x27;s not complete for my needs.  I need a few more eye brushes and this is heavy on the foundation brushes.  Since I use mineral foundation, those are all still sitting in their wrappers.  I had an issue with the fluffy blender shedding more than I felt was acceptable, but since I bought from a marketplace seller rather than Amazon directly, Sigma refused to assist me.</li>
    <li> Brushes are definitly the best that I have ever used.  I would rate these better than MAC brushes.  I wish the stippling brush would have been included in the kit instead of the regular foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> i got these brushes for my birthday from my wonderful husband. i had been hinting that i wanted sigma brushes for a very long time! well, he finally got the hint. anyway, they are everything i could have ever dreamed of. i own many MAC brushes, and i believe these sigma brushes are SO much softer. i&#x27;ve been using them everyday since i got them, and haven&#x27;t had much fallout at all. i hardly use my MAC brushes at all, anymore!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a makeup brush set in the stores.  Several counter girls told me they only stock sets of brushes during the Christmas season, and I was looking for a birthday present in August...    This set comes in a pretty, black net bag tied with a bow.  The brushes were a combination of natural and synthetic.  They apply powders and eyeshadows well and the blender brush works nicely.  The gift recipient has commented that she gets much better results from these Sigma brushes than she did from cheaper brushes bought at local stores. This is not the most expensive or prettiest set one could buy, but it was excellent value for money for a complete set of basic brushes in packaging nice enough to give as a gift.  I would buy again, and will probably get myself one as a travel set.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these Sigma brushes! They are fantastic, so soft and are MAC quality at like a third of the cots, what&#x27;s not to love???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to using make up brushes and I really wanted a complete set without having to spend a massive amount. I&#x27;d been looking at MAC brushes and really wanted them but there was no way I could afford to buy all the brushes in one go. I checked youtube and found a lot of people were raving about these sigma brushes and comparing them to MAC so I had a look and ordered. I was very happy when i got them, the brushes look and feel of real high quality and they are really soft. I was also surprised to see I had a free mini brush. They do the job and they clean very well and I&#x27;m very confident they will last. I&#x27;m so happy with them I&#x27;ve convinced both my sisters to buy their own sets!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in looooove with those brushes. After watching numerous videos I knew I wanted them.  This kit contains all the brushes I need and the price is unbeatable. You won&#x27;t get better brushes for this price that&#x27;s for sure. I don&#x27;t know MAC brushes (in fact I don&#x27;t have the means to buy a mac starter kit in the first place) but these Sigma brushes are much better than some from other brands with higher prices.  I&#x27;m in France but they shipped my order (for less than 10 euros !) anyway and I received it exactly 7 days after ordering (that is 5 business days). I&#x27;m totally happy with my purchase. The brushes were perfectly packed and there was a free brush too.  All in all I&#x27;m super happy custumer and am already planning my next order from Sigma. I recommend !!</li>
    <li> I received my Sigma brushes in 2 days!!! They came via USPS delivered to my home in a padded envelope in perfect condition. They were wrapped in a black mesh pouch which included the 12 piece set (individually wrapped in plastic protectors), a cleaning instructions card, a pamphlet about each brush and what to use it for and a FREE gift, an extra travel size blending brush! I am extremely satisfied with the quality, packing and shipping of my brushes! What a great deal!! I am a big believer of wash-before-you-use... I washed them as soon as I got a chance. There was very little shedding on the eye brushes, the taper blender E40 did have mild shedding. The large powder brush F30 had moderate shedding and the large angled contour F40 had a mild funky smell. All of those issues went away completely after the wash. The quality is amazing, when compared to other &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes these definately take the cake! I prefer these over MAC, Clinique, Lancome and Bobbi Brown brushes. For the price of 2 of the previously named brushes, I have a professional set of 12 awesome brushes!! Overall I am extremely happy with the purchase and will be looking forward to many more interactions with Sigma! I hope this review was helpful!! Merry Christmas xoxo</li>
    <li> I love my new Sigma Brushes. They come in all different sizes that are great for completing my everyday look. These brushes are soft and very easy to clean. I greatly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> After receiving my brushes, I must say they are phenomenal. I love them and I think they are just as good as MAC. I would recommend these brushes to everyone who is a makeup enthusiast. For the cost these are worth every penny. I believe in the future I will be purchasing more Sigma products.</li>
    <li> At first, I was afraid about thie order because I live in Brazil. But, they arrived perfectly and soooooo fast! I&#x27;m totally in love with them!!!  They are excelent! :-))</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 12pcs professional makeup brush set from Sigma and absolutely LOVED it! So far I have used drugstore brands, MAC, Lancome and despite all their own advantages the Sigma brush set is much better. I have been shopping around, reading blogs and reviews - Sigma was always highly rated. So I wanted to give Sigma a try. I wish I had tried them earlier !!!!   I highly recommend this brush set even if you are just starting into doing your makeup: you should start with the best!</li>
    <li> These sigma brushes are the absolute best! I recently started really getting interested in make-up and had been looking for brushes to use. I was told Sigma was the best and everyone was right! This was a great buy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are one of the best brushes I have ever owned. They have soft bristles and apply the makeup very well. Cleaning them is no hassal at all, and they work equally as well after washing them. Sigma brushes are one of the best brushes and they are less expensive than other professional brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  The set of 12 is perfect for getting started building a toolkit for makeup. My order came quickly (four days), packaged with a little black mesh bag along with info cards which helped me get familiar with which brush to use for different tasks and how to clean the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are densely packed with very soft fibers, and the shiny silvertone ferrules have no wiggle so I don&#x27;t foresee any future issues there. A little bit of shedding occurred with the large powder brush, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them, and they look very professional sitting in a container on my desk/vanity. They work well too, floofing around corners and edges of my face depositing just the right amount of color. I will definitely be looking to purchase a kabuki from Sigma also, to round out the set.</li>
    <li> loved, great quality, I will like to have 100... of them. Me encantaron, super suaves, hacen mas facil aplicar mi maquillaje.</li>
    <li> My husband got me these makeup brushes for mother&#x27;s day and I was sooo happy. I had done a lot of research and I always kept coming back to two sets from Sigma. I love makeup and I have tried other brushes but I have never had some as nice as these. I wanted brushes that came in a pouch or holder and I was worried they were just going to be thrown in a box and shipped, but I was so happy to see that the packaging was very nice too. I still keep them in the bag they came in and the plastic on the handle! ohhh I just want to keep them forever! and did I mention it did not take long for me to get them, surely  it felt long but it was because I could not wait to get them. They are very soft and do not shed. I had to tell all my girlfriends and family about them. They are awesome. The only thing I would ask from Sigma is that they have other colors for this same set and in the same price, that would be awesome! And don&#x27;t think this good review was made just to receive the gift they offer after purchase, I tried out the brushes long enough after I bought them just to know if they are good and, they are great. I will definitely choose Sigma again.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have gotten these brushes with the bag. I will have to buy the bag for these brushes next time from Sigma...these brushes come clean and well made...nice package from Sigma too..I am a makeup artist and I am satisfied with these brushes with its price level.</li>
    <li> The brushes are perfect... this is the first set that i bought, i choose sigma by the different comments that i read on several blogs on the web. definitly they are everything that they promised, very soft and good materials for the customer and seem to have good performance. beside, the delivery was just perfect in time :) in the future i´ll but the f80 because i really want it.... thanks a lot :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They&#x27;re just like, if not better, than MAC brushes! These brushes are such a steal because of their quality level and price. They arrived to my house about a week before scheduled and came in great shape in a cute black mesh bag. These are a makeup lover&#x27;s must have!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very worth. That brushes is very soft when i used on my face. Im not pain anythings. Thanks you for made the great brushes.  ^___^</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my new Sigma Beauty Professional Brush set.  Wonderful quality and so reasonable, especially given how NICE these are!  They wash and dry nicely.  Love the natural bristle brushes...they are soft and hold on to the product very well.  I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect pencil brush, and I have found it in this set!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I had purchased a few from their sigmax line and was so impressed I had to try this set out.  They&#x27;re so soft.  I can&#x27;t believe I got this type of quality for the price I paid.  I&#x27;m very happy with all the brushes and glad I ordered them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. Im really picky about brushes, i like them to be very soft and these did not disappoint. I already have several of the Mac versions and they were very similar. Not quite as soft but definitely soft enough for me. They were all pretty dense and fluffy. A lot of them shed a little bit the first couple uses but stopped and have been fine since.  They look great and feel like good quality. I hope they last a long time but if I need to I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I loved my products, I&#x27;m very glad and satisfied with it!! I recommend to all my friends, Sigma is really an awesome brand and i loved !</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a brush set for such a long time and i was surfing on the internet for a really long time looking for good ones because i thought that there must be somewhere brushes that come close to mac ones but are not as expensive. Although you can recieve a gift if you write a review here im completly being honest as on the card it does not say to give necessarily a positive comment, just any would be fine i guess. Maybe other are not, but i am totally happy with my choice...for this amout of money the brushes are of high quality...even if i dont use the dry and shape from sigma to dry the brushes they dont lose their shape and dry very quickly and they are very soft. I absolutly love them and especially the little black box you get it in- perfect for travelling. Im so in love with them. For 12 brushes of mac i would have to spend over 300-400$ and i almost get the same quality for much less. I would recommend them to everyone ,from beginner to pro.</li>
    <li> When I received the brushes, I noticed the high quality and texture of it. I tried using their eye brushes and it works beautifully getting a precise blend of colors!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and soft brushes!!! This set has all sorts of brushes starting from large powder brush, foundation brush, blush brush, concealer brush, eyeshadow brushes, eyeshadow pencil brush, eye liner and blending brush!!! It has everything you need!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I just received my 12 piece brush set from SIGMA. They are the best brushes I ever bought. They are better then MAC. They are so soft and easy to use..  [[ASIN:B003UNP20W Sigma Beauty Essential Kit]]</li>
    <li> My dad purchased these brushes for me for my birthday and i absolutely love them! They are so soft and i am use to using bare mineral&#x27;s brushes which are so so soft and these are just as amazing if not better! The brushes allow the make up to go on so flawlessly! I just love them!!!! HIGHLY recommend them! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call myself a \\&quot;makeup diva\\&quot; as some make up quizzes that you can take online would, but I would like to say that I&#x27;m willing to take a chance on different fads and products, and with doing so, you&#x27;ll need good, sturdy, reliable, durable brushes, that don&#x27;t cost a arm and four legs to replace. There are alot of reviews on these brushes all over the internet and let me just say, as a person who has seen and read majority of them, and now actually useing them, You have to get them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re a occasional makeup wearer, or a professional artist, for the price, they can not be beat!&lt;br /&gt;MAC quality for reasonable department store prices</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist I am always looking for new products.  I decided to try these brushes and in my opinion these brushes were amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great compared to the more expensive leading brands, but the results were flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to any professional or budding makeup artist.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these brushes. As a makeup artist, I am always looking for new things to add to my kit and these brushes have made me very happy. They are made well and apply makeup very well. Definite comparison to MAC brushes. Great value. I was also very pleased with how quickly I received them. They came almost an entire week early. &#x3D;) Very pleased makeup artist!</li>
    <li> my wife wanted me to get this and couldnt wait untill i could send it to her, she loved it, and thanks me for gettin it, thank u sigma for an awesome product, i would definately recommend this to others too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for makeup brushes with great quality but a little less expensive than other brands. I&#x27;ve been hearing about Sigma brushes everywhere and decided to give it a try. I have the to say that the Sigma brushes are amazing!  They have great quality and they can get the work done! The packaging was neat and my order came in almost a week early, so that was major plus ;)</li>
    <li> I Just received my sigma makeup tools and I am very pleased on how fast I received it. I enjoyed the free travel size brush. Also The brushes are so soft you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I am very happy and will tell all my friends about these tools.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of these brushes! The shipping was fast and the pricing was fantastic for how many brushes come in the set! I would recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality make up brush, professional or personal :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are worth every penny.  I received my brushes for Christmas, and they were packaged neatly with care.  I admire Sigma for their delicate precision and I give them a solid 10/10.  The brushes smelled good, and I could tell that Sigma went through the effort to create each brush by hand.  I even received a free brush!! They included helpful brochures that showed me how to use each brush, and how to clean each brush and care for it! The quality is AMAZING as well!! I have experienced no shedding, and they are soft to the touch.  They apply makeup evenly and pick up alot of product.  They are extremely comparable to the pricey MAC brushes!  Overall, this product is well worth the inexpensive expense, and I would definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> AMAZING. I am in love with these brushes. They are very high quality and I am so happy I purchased them.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes to day and I am thrilled. The shipping was fast and overall I&#x27;m satisfied. I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Just got the sigma brush kit from my husband for my birthday so thrilled!!They are sooo soft. They arrived in perfect condition and on time .THe quality of the brushes are amazing and for such a reasonable price I would recommend them for everybody. They come with everything you need to apply your make up with ease .The instructions make it very easy to know what brush is for what, somthing i really needed. If you are looking for fantastic brush set this is the one . You will not regret it !! Did I mention that they are super soft . I just love this set!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes the night of the 15 (of august 2010) and received them the 18! Fastest shipping for any product ive ever ordered!! These brushes are so soft and i think they are great for people who dont want to spend a fortune on MAC brushes . I dont own any MAC brushes so i cant compare, but as long as i have my SIGMA brushes, i dont think ill be buying MAC brushes for a while! great deal and i was pleasantly surprised with how they shipped me them. all the brushes were individually wrapped and the package had bubble wrap. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE TO A FRIEND!!! great job sigma!</li>
    <li> Not great as MAC brushes, but long lasting and good quality</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last Wednesday or Thursday and it was in my mailbox by Monday. The package was securely wrapped in bubble wrap. I pulled out the bundle and it was all in mint condition. Each individual brush was wrapped safely. I unwrapped them and they were so soft. Amazing quality. I had heard good reviews about it but they didn&#x27;t do the product justice. They are close to MAC quality, if not better, because of the price. I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone just starting out in makeup or who has been doing makeup for a significant amount of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about Sigma brushes through youtube reviews, and have held out pretty long before actually purchasing them. BUT I regret not getting them sooner, they are so wonderful!! I have brushes which I&#x27;ve bought here and there from various drug stores, and they do not even compare or come close. As for my first week with Sigma&#x27;s brushes they are really sturdy, soft, and as for my experience with washing them for the first time, none of my brushes shed (the F30 shedded maybe one or two bristles when washing, but barely!). So far I have tested out the large contour angle brush-F40 (great for placing blush at the apple of my cheeks!), and the duo fibre-F50 (gives me that \\&quot;air brush\\&quot; look with my foundation application) and they are both amazing. I can&#x27; wait to test out all the other brushes. They also shipped pretty fast, and none of my brushes were damaged, plus they come in a cute little bag. I would rather spend my money on these quality brushes, which in all probably cost the same to if you were to purchase 2-3 comparable brushes from MAC or Sephora. The only regret I have is not purchasing the brushes with the storage pouch. Thank you Sigma for making such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely adore my new sigma brushes. These are certainly comparable to my MAC brushes. They are incredibly soft and do not scratch or tug on my skin as many cheap brushes do. The quality is amazing and for signifigantly cheaper than my beloved MACs.  Theyhave a nice long handle with good weight to them.  Im excited every morning i wake up just to put my makeup on :)</li>
    <li> I havent used all the brushes yet. The products took quite some time to get to me since I live in the Phil. Maybe 2-4 moths.My first impressions on the over all look and the packaging was great! but the black leather travel puch had 2 little white spots. So far I tried the blush brush, which was super soft but had a little bit of fallout, the angled blush brush which was really soft too ( but not a lot of product gets caught in it so you have to re-dip it to the compact a couple of times.) the small concealer brush was a bit pokey though.    Maybe I have to wash them first. hehe    Overall theyr really pretty brushes and worth the wait!    Im excited to use all the brushes though cos they look promising!.</li>
    <li> I recieved my brushes in the mail about a week or two ago.. I decided to get them after reading the good reviews on them. They are definitely the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. They really make a big differnce on how my makeup comes out. The bigger brushes do shed a little bit though :-( I want to get the travel set also because these brushes are a tad long and hit the mirror when I put on my makeup. Other than that, these brushes are great and I do not regret getting them! I will be ordering from sigma again.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup brushes! They were delivered really fast! The duo fibre brush really does give an airbrushed look. The insert that describes what the brushes are used for is extremely helpful. The different brushes for eye makeup really help to improve the look of eye shadows. I love this product and I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I received a MAC Brush set for Christmas that was (in my opinion) overpriced for 5 brushes. I&#x27;m a makeup lover and wanted a larger brush set that could manage daily use, was high quality, and would last a couple years. After looking online and doing a ton of comparison shopping across brush brands I landed on these Sigma brushes. I received them two days ago and am VERY happy with the quality. I completed the washing instructions and used them this morning for my makeup. Net-Net, great quality at a great price! You really can&#x27;t go wrong. I kept my MAC brush set for my travel makeup brushes and these will be my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; ones. To be honest, after using both - the Sigma ones yield the same result and at a much better price. If you&#x27;re looking for high quality brushes at a solid price I would definitely recommend this Sigma set.</li>
    <li> super fast shipping! i got it in 3 days and i used them once i got them! i love these brushes. they really are great . you should try them out. i give them 10/10 stars!</li>
    <li> No words can describe my love for these brushes! They are amazing! They are my babies! Every time I see them, I stop and run my fingers through them because they are just SO soft. Performance is amazing as well...  This was my Christmas gift from my mother. Originally, I had wanted to buy the set that included the brush roll but when I went to order it, it was SOLD OUT!!! I was so disappointed but I just couldn&#x27;t wait for it to be back in stock and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! I had been wanting to buy these brushes for a LONG time but I was very hesitant because of the price. It is a GREAT deal but it&#x27;s still 80 dollars, if you know what I mean. Well, let me tell you, OH BOY, was it worth it!!!! There is not a single brush that I don&#x27;t use in this set.   Shipping was sooner than I expected and packaging was SO adorable. It just looks like Sigma puts so much thought into it and its so nice. Plus, it came with a free E25 Blending brush that is amazing and definitely an added bonus. I read the little card that recommends washing them before the first use but since I got them New Year&#x27;s Day and wanted to use them for my makeup that night, I didn&#x27;t. I wish I had but truly, no big deal.   -The large shader brush is a DREAM and it works AMAZING when I apply my M.A.C paint pots.  -The small shader brush picks up color extremely well and works perfect for packing color on the lid.   -The tapered blending brush is inredibly soft. Also, it works great to create depth on the crease. I just pick up a little eyeshadow, sweep back and forth on my crease about twice and done! Makes a world of difference for smokey eyes.  -the angled shading brush is great for highlighting the brow-bone!  -The angled gel liner brush &#x3D; LOVE  -Pencil brush is good for really deepening the crease and for below the bottom waterline. I adore it!  My only complaints would be the concealer brush, which I found a bit pokey, and the angled contour brush which I don&#x27;t absolutely adore but it still holds a special spotin my heart. Lol!  OVERALL, the ENTIRE set is amazing. There isn&#x27;t a single brush that I don&#x27;t adore. Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying, you&#x27;ll really get your money&#x27;s worth. Besides, I am a firm believer that you&#x27;re getting M.A.C quality brushes (or better!) for a third of the price! THANK YOU SIGMA! You really do give M.A.C brushes a run for their money!

    <li> I have been anxiously awaiting these brushes and was so excited when they were finally delivered. These brushes do not disappoint!! They are sturdy and very well made. I am not new to makeup but I have never owned a proper make up brush kit. I have a few brushes but the hairs tend to shed during makeup application and the ferrules became loose shortly after purchasing them. I also have a couple from MAC but purchasing a full set would just be too pricey for my budget. Sigma falls right within my budget range. I look forward to purchasing additional brushes as I learn more makeup techniques. The brushes comes in a very nice black mesh drawstring bag; however, my only regret about this purchase is that I didn&#x27;t order the set with the brush roll---which I plan to order after posting this review...LOL!</li>
    <li> I have only used the brushes for a couple of weeks now, but they are great. Two of the brushes, the powder and the duo fiber, shed when I first started using them which worried me a bit. The shedding has stopped, thankfully, and I think that the shedding was just bristle remains from manufacturing. Application and craftmanship quality is excellent. Great price!</li>
    <li> These are really really good brushes. I always heard about them on YouTube from beauty gurus, but i never tried them out before until recently. I asked for them for Christmas and they are amazing. The quality is very very good and they have many uses and just apply makeup so flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I did a weekly washing of my brushes (like youre supposed to) and i needed to apply blush in the morning but the brush was still wet so i used my old, generic brush that came with one of those cheapy makeup kits from walamart and it was the brush i had been using for months unil i got these brushes and let me tell you, the difference in texture was RIDICULOUSLY noticeable. I could barely use my old brush because it was so rough on my skin and just didnt feel good at all. I never noticed how hurtful and bad quality it was until after using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
    <li> I got this set this morning and I cleaned them right away so that I can test them out immediately. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I love the face brushes and the angled eyeshadow brush. I&#x27;m so excited to try them all out this weekend!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast. The brushes arrived in a safe package and they were all very protected and good condition. I have yet to use the brushes but they feel super soft and good quality. This brush set offers a great variety of face and eye brushes to make any look.     I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Pleased with the brushes. They are soft and pick up pigment nicely. I bought them because I had to replace all of my brushes after a round of pink eye. For the price it is great. And they shipped it impressively quickly.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! Love how soft they are on on my face. My all time favorite brushes!! Worth every penny. ;)</li>
    <li> I have MAC brushes but wanted to add to my collection. Because MAC are so expensive I searched the internet for a cheaper alternative and came across Sigma Makeup.   When I ordered them I wasn&#x27;t sure what standard they would be but ordered them anyway to find out.  When they arrived they were in a beautiful little cute black see through bag with a ribbon and have a booklet explaining what to do with each brush (which I thought was a very good thing to do because not everyone would know what the purpose for each brush was if they were only new to makeup).   The only thing I would say about the booklet is the codes on the brushes do not match those in the booklet, but it doesnt matter because they have pictures too.  Sigma also sent a free travel makeup brush along with my purchase, which has me now wanting to buy the Naughty or Nice travel collection.   I actual prefer these brushed towards my MAC brushes, it seems that the things you want to have changed with your MAC brushes Sigma have gone ahead and done changed them. . for the better. And the price!. . . well worth $79.</li>
    <li> These brushes are definitely of high quality. They are extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t shed at all. I have some mac brushes but they are not as soft as these, and they are much cheaper! This is a must buy for anybody wanting some new brushes!</li>
    <li> I heard of Sigma brushes mainly through Youtube videos and reviews on make up forums. All I can say is I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with my kit. The brushes are unexpensive for their high quality, very similar to some of my MAC brushes.     Thank you Sigma!</li>
    <li> I received 12 piece professional brushset today. They are amazingly soft and they look quality brushes. I have seen a lot of good reviews on youtube and it is said that they are comparable to mac. I have not used them yet but by the look and feel they do look like Mac brushes. Shipping was fast and I am super happy with my purchase. They are very soft. Highly recommend them if you cannot afford or don&#x27;t want to invest so much money in almost similar brushes.</li>
    <li> This set is perfect for everyday use, Mac brushes are so expensive and this set is great quality as mac but for the fraccion of the price. I&#x27;ve been using this set for a month and I don&#x27;t regret. The desig is perfect, the black handles makes this brushes so elegant and i love the description and uses of each brush. I would definitely recommend my friends to buy it!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve bought the brush set twice now, one for me and one for my mom.  Both times, I was not disappointed.  The bristles are soft and comes with a great assortment of brushes.  I anticipate I may end up buying a few more individual brushes to add to what I already have.</li>
    <li> Asked for this set for Christmas, so glad I did! They work amazing and are such good quality! In my opinion way more worth it than Mac!</li>
    <li> i bought this set for my makeup kit and i love them so much i want to get another set for my own personal use too!</li>
    <li> It was really nice to be able to have this item ship to HK because a lot of stuff don&#x27;t usually ship to HK. I got the item 9 days after order which is pretty fast. I really like how everything is wrapped so i can just give it to my friend as a gift and don&#x27;t have to wrap it myself. Everything is new and there was even a small gift included.</li>
    <li> I brought this brushes set for my girlfriend for Christmas. She love it. The deliver is pretty fast. I ordered it on December 24(Night) and we got it on December 29.    The set came in a pretty bow bag. Four big brushes have plastic cover and the rest are covered by thin plastic. She said, \\&quot;all brushes are soft and strong.\\&quot; She will buy more products from Sigma.</li>
    <li> Ive been wanting to get my hands on these sigma brushes &amp; finally i decided to purchases them since everyone was loving and recommending me this brushes.  I am very happy with this purchased and would come back and pick up a travel brush set from Sigma. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> my product arrived 4 days before i even expected it to and they&#x27;re definitely in the condition i wanted and more.   i can&#x27;t wait to use them again!</li>
    <li> The Sigma brushes are professional grade brushes that are made to last! The application each brush delivers is top of the line. The cost for these brushes is an unbelievable deal and well worth it! I would highly recommend this bundle to anyone, especially if you&#x27;re starting out in makeup. Do yourself a favor and buy quality brushes that will last!</li>
    <li> I have always bought cheap brushes, and average walmart brushes, as I am a mom and can spend money on high priced brushes like MAC. Well my husband told me to buy this for myself and I am so glad I did! These are real quality brushes, soft, precise, strong, durable...just wonderful! If you are like me and you want a real quality set of brushes and can&#x27;t quite get the MAC brand, do yourself a favor and get these! Make sure you know how to wash brushes and take care of them too, I have a feeling they will outlast any brush I have owned to this point!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m in LOVE with these brushes! I wish I could describe just how soft they truly are! I&#x27;ve tried everything from MAC to drugstore, and these are without a doubt the best, and I will definitely be buying more. I know the price on them may seem a little steep, especially considering this economy, but I can guarantee 100% satisfaction, I would say these beat MAC any day in the quality department, and they&#x27;re half the price! Buy these and you won&#x27;t be sorry. Shipping and delivery was amazingly quick and easy, and customer support was outstanding! I look forward to working with Sigma again!</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are incredible. They&#x27;re soft and there are so many. My face LOVES them. I made a video for my youtube on how much I recommend them. It comes with a pamphlet on what each one does and how to use them. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been searching for a good set of makeup brushes for the longest time! I haven&#x27;t use all the brushes yet, so far the eye brushes are wonderful. The fluffy blending brush is one of my favorite brush that i use everyday. The brushes are great along with the price. They equal out to only 7 buckaroo a brush! How can you go wrong with that &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought sigma F80 first and I love it, so when I want to have some new brushes I bought this set. It has all the brushes I needed and works great. Really love sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a month now and I absolutely love them!! I purchased them mainly for the stipple brush and a few of the eyeshadow brushes but they are exactly what I was looking for and more. I will definitely be purchasing more brushes from Sigma in the future.</li>
    <li> I gave those brushes to my wife and  she simply loved!  It&#x27; s a perfect gift for valentine&#x27;s day: she said that every woman need this for a perfect look:)</li>
    <li> This is my first make up brush set, I&#x27;ve purchased M.A.C brushes before, but never owned a complete set of face brushes, I was really hesitant to purchase on-line because I&#x27;ve never felt or used sigma brushes before, I washed the brush set and there was no shedding, brushes are very soft and work great when applying makeup, they look of very high quality and I can tell that they will last a long time with proper care. The brushes came very quickly and in a cute packaging black tie mesh bag, the only complaint I have is I wish that they had came in a makeup brush case so that it was easier to travel with them and protect them better, although they do have protective sleeves. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and recommend this set to anyone who is interested in growing their makeup brush collection or just starting out because they are so reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> i love this line of product better then most of the famous brands out there and as always they ship fast with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Wonderful set, came in a pretty black bag with each brush covered in plastic wrap. Bigger brushes have guards on them to store them in. Brought also information on how to use each brush and how to care for the brushes. I have a sigma F80 and love it (it is a bit dense so when I use it for foundation I have to air dry it after washing takes about a day to dry)so much was going to buy another one since I use it daily and I like to wash it after each use (liquid foundation. I ended up buying this kit after reading many reviews and comparisons to the MAC brushes. One review I read explained which Sigma ones were comparable to the MAC. F80 was one and most in this kit were comparable to MAC, so saved some $$ and bought the kit. Can&#x27;t beat 79$!!!! Did not buy the roll as I need a larger role to store my other brushes with this set (I own Bobbi brown set- they are a good set (except the white contour brush - sheds like crazy- I do however like the Sigma F80 much better for applying liquid foundation than my Bobbi brown foundation brush just seems to cover more and go on smoother). Highly recommend the set and the store (great service).</li>
    <li> brushes are perfect, the Makeup&#x27;m really incredible and when I pot the difference make up with them and when not in use, had no time thinking about buying but I think now decided \\&quot;that I did before\\&quot;, 100% recommended .</li>
    <li> I love seeing makeup tutorials on youtube and all the girls im subscribed to used the sigma brushes. I loved the reviews on the brushes, so I told my boyfriend that I wanted the sigma brushes for my birthday. I got them a week before my birthday I was so excited to start using them. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks already and I love them, they are soft and good quality. Now i love doing my makeup :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing to the touch.  I&#x27;ve had sigma brushes before and was never let down in terms of the quality.  These brushes are so soft and perfect.  I didnt have loose hairs after I immediately washed when they arrived. These rushes great!</li>
    <li> Love,love, love these brushes!!!! My sister got these brushes for Christmas last year and she has been able to create amazing looks with the Sigma brushes and now that I have bought them for myself Iam having the same results!!!</li>
    <li> So I bought these brushes like 2-3 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using them for my daily makeup routine. I have to say that they are doing their job very well. When I first washed them there was little to no fall-out which was great. I really like the large powder brush butI wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the blending brush because its a bit too wide for my liking but it still does its job. Overall if you are looking for a kit with all the essentials I really do recommend this kit because it has all the basic and necessary brushes and it&#x27;s not as expensive as other kits I&#x27;ve seen. You can definitely find better quality BUT it will definitely be more pricy :/&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I almost forgot, I liked the fact that they come with a little pamphlet that describes what each brush can be used for and how to clean them.</li>
    <li> Based solely on how these brushes apply makeup, I give them a five.  Based on how they looked when I first received them, a four, due to the F60 being oily?! when I received it, and a few others had some some loose bristles already, looked to me like they were used, but maybe I am just being overly critical.  Based on how they responded to being cleaned, I give them a shaky 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them once, and cleaned them immediately after, and the Duo Fibre (F50), the angled contour (f40), and the eye shading (e55) brushes had a TON of hair that came out in just a couple seconds!  I KNOW how to properly clean brushes, I&#x27;ve been babying my cheap brushes for years, and you know what, they never did this.  Is this really what everyone raves about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated earlier, they apply makeup flawlessly, but, how long will it be until I drop another $100 (to include shipping) on brushes that fall apart on me the moment I clean them?  It&#x27;s a tough choice to make, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> I love my brushes, absolutely. I think the quality of the brushes can make all the difference with makeup application, and these brushes are worth the price. I&#x27;m so excited to get all the use I can about them, and maybe invest some more down the road.</li>
    <li> I was unbelievably impressed with these brushes!  Such great quality for an amazing price!  I live overseas in Italy and had to have them shipped to an APO address - got them in a little over a week!  IMPRESSIVE!!!!!  I recommend these to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> These are high-quality, professional brushes that are more than worth the price. My makeup now looks flawless thanks to them. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hello from Germany,     first please excuse the bad spelling and grammar but I´m from Germany and English is not  my frist language.  So 4 weeks ago I looked here in Germany for a good but not so expensiv Set of Make-up Brushes.  After a long Serch I decided to buy a Set from Sigma because of the good reviews on miscellaneous   Homepages.   You need to know it´s not so easy to get these Brushes here in Germany and the only Site I found  sells them for Prices without any reason for much higher Price then the Sigma Site.  But with a Creditcard there are no Problems to buy in other Country´s.  And now I have after a 4 Week holding time my Sigma Brush Set for only $97.50 instead of $120 or more.  As I expected  the Brushes are wounderfull, soft and there don´t loses hairs as my former one´s.  There is no more to say then : I LIKE IT!    Greetings fom Germany *wave*</li>
    <li> Great quality! Love them. I love make up and theses brushes are amazing. Way better than MAC brushes. Really happy with them and glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift and she absolutely loves them. This is what she said about these brushes: I love wide variety of brushes. They are stylish, blend well, are super soft and don&#x27;t shed. Well worth spending the money on these!</li>
    <li> I found this brush set to be of high quality.  There is a good selection and variation in the 12 piece set. I&#x27;ve also found that these brushes hold up well to many cleanings.  I would recommend this brush set to anyone looking for high quality, affordable brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set after doing some searching for the best \\&quot;set\\&quot; of brushes. These had great reviews for the most part and I am so beyond pleased with them. They are definitely MAC comparable {in my experience} and a fantastic buy for the price. I would recommend these to anyone and plan on getting my sister a set too :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my set. It&#x27;s very well-rounded. (Great for a starter set)&lt;br /&gt;My favorite brushes are; the F30 large powder brush, the E05 eye liner and the E70 med angled shading.&lt;br /&gt;They pick up product very well and are very soft. Will buy from sigma in the future again.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Sigma customer service is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality.</li>
    <li> I am really in love with this product &amp; it&#x27;s affordable! I only wish it can with a brush case.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and have been for years, so naturally I was hopeful that these brushes would do the job for me.  I thought they are great and here&#x27;s why; they clean up great and keep their shape, the bristles are very dense and fibers are super soft, with little to no shedding. I would highly recommend, these brushes will last for years to come.  P.S.  Shampoo in baby shampoo works great!!  I want the color coral brushes now!!  :)</li>
    <li> First I somehow I love sigma I received this brush set I did not expect the brushes to be that big , But I liked them</li>
    <li> I ordered these great make up brushes trough the sigma frontstore and i was so excited when i got it in the mail ( less then 5 days). The bruhes like soooOoo many people know ( watch reviews on youtube)are great quality, and comparing to other top named brushes out there the price is so amazing. Thanks SIGMA i love them already and cant wait to try youre other products....</li>
    <li> This is the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;m in love with them - they are amazing, I would definitely recommend these to anyone as they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Was thinking of buying individual brushes from Mac until I came across the reviews for sigma beauty brushes.  The brushes are a good quality and value for the price.</li>
    <li> It is true that Sigma sends a free gift if you leave a review, but they in no way suggest what your review should be. Customers are still free to rate the brushes as they like. My set of 12 make up brushes arrived today and I am delighted with the quality. For the amount of brushes in this set, I think the price is far better than they would have cost individually at any beauty supply store. To me they are an investment I believe will last for years. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great. A few of them have shed a bit though and I&#x27;ve been gentle with them. But overall I do enjoy them, they are soft and easy to work with. I am a beginner to make up so this is a wonderful starter kit (:</li>
    <li> I bought this set because of good reviews and have to put a bad one myself... Terrible that&#x27;s all I can say. Shedding is stil going on after month of use and washing and the worst shedding happens with white hair brushes, like : pencil - E30 not much of a brush left, Large angled contour - F40 sheds like a dog and spreaded wide soooo much that is not angled anymore... The most use I&#x27;ve got out of Tapered blending E40 , and Medium angled shading E70 , that&#x27;s why I give two stars, but really even one is too much. Don&#x27;t want to deal with all calling and mailing, takes too much time, but wish they read this review and send me a replacement set... MONEY WASTED...</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are well worth the price. I used to use my fingers to apply my makeup, but these brushes apply makeup flawlessly. I will never go back. I will always use these makeup brushes from now on!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They came quickly, are packaged nicely, and feel very sturdy. Also, the handles are long and allow for much control.</li>
    <li> I bought these since I heard great things about them and since I need to replace a combination of eye and face brushes, it was a good deal.  The eye brushes in this set are great.  They&#x27;re very soft and it&#x27;s easy to be precise with them. E60 and E55 are in my collection of favorites now.  The face brushes are kind of average to me.  I&#x27;m very much a mineral make up person and a fair amount of them don&#x27;t work well with that type of make up.  For me the F50, F60, and F70 are nearly useless for my type of make up.  But the blush brush is pretty solid.  It holds make up well and cleans easily enough; same with the large powder brush.  My only complaint with those to is that they&#x27;re shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy and I&#x27;m happy with the majority of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been planning to get a makeup brush set for so long but I did not want to spend exorbitant amounts on MAC though I do own couple of them. The brushes arrived on time and in perfect condition. The brushes are great and definitely worth the price. I think the packaging could have been better...I am glad I do not have to buy brushes for a long time to come</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast! I received these beautiful brushes on 7 Aug, just two weeks after ordering. I thought It will be longer as I&#x27;m living in West Malaysia. They arrived in excellent packaging and in good condition, with a free gift too!... a small cute blending brush. So glad that i ordered the travel kit from [...] The quality of these brushes is amazing. They are comparable to MAC brushes except that it is very much affordable. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> im very much satisfied with these brushes! i ordered them maybe like 3 days ago, ships very fast! i love how the brushes are soft yet very durable. great quality for the price! i think i just found my favorite kind of brushes!</li>
    <li> After seeing several online videos i decided to purchase a set for myself. I love the set!  This is defenetly on my list to get for my sister in law and girlfriends.  They are going to love it as well.  Great value for the price i payed.  Comes even with a sheet where all the brushes are explained - picture of brush and for what use like foundation or blush.  Which comes handy for a beginner like me</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I bought them based on the recommendation of a friend who is a makeup artist, although i was skeptical as i hadn&#x27;t heard about this company before, but i figured she must know her stuff, and i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! Exceptional quality, very soft feel, precise application, can&#x27;t beat the price, and i also received them very quickly. I will recommend the Sigma brushes to all my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I recently bought Sigma Makeup 12pcs Professional Brush Set from Sigma Makeup thru Amazon. I was waiting and counting the days for the brushes to arrive. Finally ... they arrived on time/ as scheduled. It comes with a free gift as well.    The brushes are well made and very nice. Also, I think it is very professional looking, especially if you are a makeup geek, these brushes are a &#x27;must have&#x27;  for your kit. The brushes are amazing! I did not own a brush similar to this until buying the Sigma Professional Set. I must say, now that I own it, I don&#x27;t know how I have ever lived without it. My favourite of the lot would be the large powder brush. It can be used for many things like bronzer or even all over finishing powder. I will use it especially for applying bronzer. This brush helps give my face that sun-kissed glow without looking like I&#x27;m wearing bronzer because it blends it into my skin so well. I think this brush will be my best friend forever.    I have many thoughts and feelings on the Sigma 12 pcs professional brush set and I am glad I bought it and for sure will want to add the Orginial Kit to my collection soon.    Hope this helps and you can also form your own opinions from my review!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good brush set for a reasonable price.  I ordered this set after reading several reviews.  I research everything before I order lol.  This brush set is amazing!!  I had no idea they would be this well made.  These are comparable to any high end brush set, including MAC.  I actually think they are better!!  Thank you sigma!!!   great product, would recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been patiently waiting for them to arrive and when they did i was speechless they went above and beyond what i expected them to be like. im in love with them.</li>
    <li> Okay, so, I have been asking for this kit for TWO YEARS (for christmas) and finally got it today. I&#x27;ve been having a makeup field day. HANDS DOWN best quality for the best price. AMAZING. The first thing i noticed was the quality of the brush roll. It is is extremely soft and had the brushes conveniently tucked away in their protective wrappers. The brushes are so soft and of such a great quality. My personal favorite the duo fiber F50. It applies foundation so beautifully; it gives an airbrushed effect. These are absolutely wonderful products! I have yet to use all of them but from the eight i have tried already i give them two thumbs WAY up! I will be purchasing other sigma products in the future, for sure. These are now my new Holy Grail product. Thanks Sigma! :)</li>
    <li> These Sigma Brushes are pretty great. My only issue is that after washing some start to shed but its very minor. I&#x27;d have to say they&#x27;re on par with me my Mac brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very good and they were definetly shipped in an orderly time. They brushes came in a nicely packed bag and slip around the brushes so they wouldnt get messed up while in the mail.</li>
    <li> This stuff really help me to get a perfect make up. Sigma products are top of the line!!!! I really love them...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my new sigma brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in a nice bag, no roll up case though which is what I&#x27;d have preferred. I guess I&#x27;m now free to choose my own. Each brush came in a plastic wrapper, the larger brushes having a stronger plastic envelope on them for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are amazing quality! WORTH the cost. This isn&#x27;t the first company I&#x27;ve bought from but I bet it&#x27;ll be the last! These brushes will last me a long time. Soft but firm fibers: natural and synthetic. They are easy to hold and their length is just about perfect. The handles are about 7-8 inches long. I LOVE the powder brush! It&#x27;s so large and poofy! No kabuki but the Blush brush is so nice its like a kabuki on a stick! :) No loss there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is a good combo. I use almost all the brushes weekly. I like to change it up. They give you a tool for just about everything in here. I would definitely recommend to friends, family, AND clients. Bravo Sigma!</li>
    <li> I purchased the complete brush set with pink brush roll from Sigma&#x27;s website on 12-11-2010.  I wanted to use the brushes for a while before writing a review so I could evaluate their performance.  While some of the brushes are good, others are not. I find inconsistent quality to be a problem with Sigma.  Of the brush set the F30 large powder brush sheds badly and is getting worse with continued washing and use.  The F50 duo fibre brush is not dense enough or have enough white fibers to be used as a stippling brush, although I do like it for blush application.  The E40 tapered blending brush is very loose and floppy - useless for applying color to the crease or for blending.  It also blew out and lost shape after washing.  The other brushes are quite good.  I like and use all of the other eyebrushes daily and have had no issues with shedding or shape loss. The F60 foundation brush and the F40 large angle contour brush are also very good.  Sigma customer service was good.  My E30 was missing from my order when it arrived.  I contacted customer service and they sent me one quickly.                                                                                                                                                          I purchased the complete brush set because I had bought the 3 piece synthetic brush set earlier and was very impressed by it.  I really love the F80, F82, and F84.  I have been using them daily and washing them often and they have not shed one hair.  They have held their shape and perform great.  I was disappointed that the great quality of these brushes was not representative of the entire line.        I am happy overall with my purchase and I do recommend it with resevations about quality control issues.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are soft and the products go on nicely with them. I highly recommend these, they are worth their price!</li>
    <li> I have been watching youtube videos about these brushes and decided i needed them. I cant believe i was using anything else. These brushes are of great quality and i would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> The only thing this set needs is an eyebrow/eyelash brush, and a smaller eye shadow brush.  Other than that, it is great.  Soft, but not too soft- effective but nice on the skin.  I was in serious need of a brush upgrade, MAC was way out of my budget- I&#x27;m happy with this set</li>
    <li> I am amazed out how quickly I got this product.  I got exactly what I ordered which is superior quality Sigma brushes.  This beginning brush set is exactly what I need to start my make up artist career.</li>
    <li> i just got my sigma brushes and im sooo frikkin exictedddd, cant wait to start using them, postal order took quicker to come which i was pleased about</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been raving about these brushes and when she finally saw them in person and used it, she absolutely LOVED the quality!</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing. I recently started watching jaaack jack youtube videos and she uses sigma brushes and so I thought I would try them also they are great especially if you are a first time brush user like me. I love them and they are very soft to the skin and really give you that natural airbrush look. makes your face flawless. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.</li>
    <li> I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  Well done, Sigma.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my brushes!!! It was fast and easy process on recieving my brushes and I cant wait to start doing looks with it!! Ive heard so many good reviews on these brushes, from the quality, to the lifetime of them!! A good quality brush is one that last for a long time, and I see that Sigma will do that for a lot of people. Including me!!!</li>
    <li> I receive it today, one of my friend recommends sigma brushes. It&#x27;s really great stuff. Many popular makeup artist are using these brushes. It&#x27;s blend the shadow colours smoothly. I didn&#x27;t try the foundation brush cuz I used to use my fingers tips, but I ll try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using FASH Lmtd. Brushes for the past few months they were ok but these brushes are by far amazing, exellent coverage and blending, well worth the 90 bucks. A must have in your makeup collection!</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES!! I have quite the brush collection and these ones are by far my favorite, even over my much more expensive or &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; brand ones!!!! I have had them for 2 years and they are still like new. I do take good care of them and clean them often also!</li>
    <li> They are fantastic, very soft and easy to use, this is my first kit of brushes and I think it is very complete and not very expensive for a start.</li>
    <li> Really great brushes. I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be this great but thy really are wonderful. They wash well and don&#x27;t seem to lose bristles.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 12pc set of Sigmas Professional brush set and the brushes are amazing! I have been wanting to purchase a set of brushes from Sigma and I finally got the chance to. The brushes are so soft and work so well blending my foundation and powder. Also, I got them for a great price! I really enjoy the time and effort Sigma puts into making there brushes. They spend so much attention to the detail and quality. I really want to thank Sigma for there amazing job on making these brushes. I will defintely buy more products from Sigma in the future. I am very pleased with my brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my The Sigma Beauty Essential Kit! The brushes are very soft and beatiful and they are perfect to create all looks you need! If you don&#x27;t have any brushes kit, this is the ideal choice!</li>
    <li> Okay so i ordered these brushes on June 9th, it said they were to come June 15th -20th. THEY CAME TODAY THE 13TH!!!!! I am so happy and pleased with Sigma as a company. If your a beginner GET THESE BRUSHES;they are soft and great. Cannot wait to use them. Love Sigma, will be purchasing more from Amazon too!</li>
    <li> when i first got these brushes i was so happy because they came so fast. when i washed them there was some sheddind on the larger brushes but not a significant amount and it seemed like only on the black brushes. not having used actual makeup brushes before all i can say is that they exeeded my expectations and apply makeup much better than the makeup sponges and apliccators that come with the makeup i normaly use. i think this prouduct is fantastic for beginners like myself who need a good quality starters kit and dont want to risk getting super expensive brushes. in fact the ony reason i gave this four stars is because this being my first set of brushes i cant compare it to any other brands that could be better or worse than this but over all i am very happy with these brushes.</li>
    <li> Ive wanted to get the Sigma make up brushes for so long. I always saw great reviews on youtube about them. I ordered them about 2 1/2 weeks ago. The shipping was fast. The packaging for the brushes was great. Each brush is so unique and I love all of them. I have been using them everyday and really want to get the sigma Kabuki brush. These brushes have such good quality.</li>
    <li> This is my review on the sigma makeup brushes (essential kit). I just have to say that I absolutely love these brushes. The quality of the bristles on each brush is amazing. The bristles are really soft and strong. I like that they pick up alot of product without much effort when applying eyeshadows, blushes and any type of powders etc.I would have liked to know prior that, when you first receive the brushes you have to do an initial cleaning because the exact day I got them I was expecting to use them that same day, but I had to wash them and use them a day later. I was pleased with the packaging of the brushes and how the face brushes had brush guards on them which really helped to keep the brush&#x27;s form during drying. I want to mention also what I like about the packaging would be the brochure that was included in the box with the brushes;that added a good touch for makeup beginners because it included the function of each brush and how you would be able to use it. The last thing that I liked was the fact that each brush had a number, which is helpful in keeping track of which brush to use for doing makeup tutorials. Thanks for my brushes and I will definitely be making future purchases from your company.</li>
    <li> The brushes are of good quality. I love the fact that each individual brush is labeled with its use. My favorite brush is the E05- eyeliner, its so easy to use. A must have for beginners!</li>
    <li> I received my brushes in a timely fashion, and they came intact and in a nice package.  They also included a pamphlet explaining what the brushes can be used for, and a guide on how to clean them.  All the brushes are amazing, they are so soft and MAC quality for a fraction of the price.  I am so glad I bought these and encourage others who are looking for an inexpensive professional quality brush set to do the same!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely spectaculuar. The set is perfect for everday use and the quality is senstational. I was in the market for a new set of brushes and everyone raves about the sigma brushes, so i decided to try them out. Although they are not super cheap,they are definitely worth the money. The makeup looks flawless when applied on the skin, drugstore and high end brands.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets of these in 2011 and they didn&#x27;t start to fall apart until three-four years later, after all the cosplay and travel abuse I&#x27;ve put into them.  Of course I&#x27;ve bought different brushes over the years to lessen their wear and tear, so that could be why they lasted this long. They have turned green over the years (comes from cleaning and the metal getting wet, now I have a brush holder for them to dry better), but otherwise there is little fall out except for the blush brushes and I probably shouldn&#x27;t have wasted money on other sets since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they were $88 back then, and I simply cannot talk myself into replacing them at $160 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money, go for it. They were worth $88 including shipping and handling. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth this but I&#x27;m just surprised at the doubling in price unless the quality has also increased with it.</li>
    <li> I had heard such great things about Sigma brushes and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I recently started expermenting more with make-up and my cheap drugstore brushes weren&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  After receiving these Sigma brushes I was SO EXCITED to start applying my makeup.  WOW! What a difference!  These brushes are truly well made, affordable and apply your makeup beautifully.  The brushes are fluffy and soft even after washing them the first time.  I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase, will definitely buy them again and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> At first, I really hesitated to order Sigma Brush Set.  At that time, I was thinking about two other options including Coozzette, Mac.  After seeing the review of Sigma Brush Set on web site, I finally decided to buy Sigma and ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item in a week.  NOW, I fell in love with those brushes.  I am so glad I chose Sigma Set.</li>
    <li> At first I was really hesitant to spend that much on brushes and after going back numerous times to the page I finally decided to purchase them. Brushes got here sooner then I expected and I was really impressed with the quality of them. If you are on the fence look at it as an investment; worth every penny. ;D</li>
    <li> I was so excited when it arrived.   All of the brushes are soft and beautiful quality. It makes makeup application so much easier when you have good brushes. [[ASIN:B003UNP20W Sigma Beauty 12pcs. Professional Brush Set]]</li>
    <li> I have tried in the past many make up brushes including M.A.C      But the best is sigma, I love it   the brushes are soft and absorbe make up and apply it pearfectly on the face  also they are so easy to clean     it make applying make up a breazzzz    Thank you sigma</li>
    <li> I am super excited about my new Sigma brushes!  I have compared them to MAC brushes and found them to be of the same quality, but a better value. I also love that Sigma included a description for each brush and instructions for care.</li>
    <li> Proffesional brushes!!!!   Soft on your skin and durable... handles are wood and it feels soo good. They grab alot of products.  Will get them again</li>
    <li> I watched and read alot of product reviews before ordering this product. They all said that the brushes were \\&quot;soooo soft\\&quot;. In reality, they&#x27;re really not exceptionally soft. The truth is that they&#x27;re alright for the price, but don&#x27;t expect professional quality. On the plus side, they haven&#x27;t lost many bristles during cleanings!</li>

These dimensions are from the sigma website. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t own these beautiful brushes but I would like to help people figure out if they are exact and not fraud. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard many reviews about the product that&#x27;s a good make-up set and decided to buy it for my girlfriend.  SHE LOVES THEM!  It&#x27;s a great gift and the price is not bad. thank you so much</li>
    <li> The brushes are very good quality for their price. The bristles are quite soft, but could be a little denser. The kit comes with a wide variety of useful and essential brushed; I am most impressed with the quality of the selection of eye brushed. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely be doing business again with this company :)</li>
    <li> I have always been one to look for deals so when I heard about Sigma Makeup Brushes I decided to give them a shot. After watching numerous reviews and doing some research I said to heck with my Walmart brushes and decided to get these. I AM SO THANKFUL I DID! Not only are they easier on my skin because they are SO soft they DO WHAT THEY ARE SAID TO DO! The Duo Fibre brush is amazing! I used it for an interview and it gave me the PERFECT coverage! I looked airbrushed! The concealer brush is dense and the perfect size and shape to cover AND get in the little crooks along you nose! I used it for under eye circles, my nose and blemishes and it was perfect. It is well worth the money because the brushes are very well made. The first thing I noticed after taking the brushes oyut of the bag was how sturdy they felt. THEY FEEL like a good quality brush. They feel durable. Which is GOOD! The powder brush is EXTREMELY soft and going from the cheap 5 dollar set from Walmart to this I felt like I was in a SPA! They are not even comparable! It was so luxurious! It picked up the right amount of powder and distributed it evenly and I looked FLAWLESS! I have never received so many compliments on my makeup...which goes to show that brushes DO make a difference. This is only a tiny bit of what I could have said, but I&#x27;ll sum up these brushes in three words! Luxurious, Durable and MUST-HAVE!</li>
    <li> I recently received my Sigma Beauty Brush Set and I was so pleasantly surprised at the high level of quality of these brushes. I have paid $30 for one brush before and to know that there are brushes of the same quality and variety for an affordable price was amazing. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set. 12 professional brushes for an amazing price? How could things go wrong? I do wish that instead of a duo fibre brush they would have included a flat top kabuki brush. I do experience minor shedding with the large powder brush but nothing extensive. These brushes are a must have and makes me realize that there is no reason spending so much on MAC when you can have the sigma ones for the same quality but at a lower price.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes were extremely expensive and arrived in a bent, beat up thin carboard box.  When you spend over $140 for brushes, the least they can do is provide decent packaging.  You would have never known this product was top of the line if you would see the packaging it arrived in.  I would not recommend this purchase to anyone.  They are not worth the money and the brushes have a terrible odor.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beyond wonderful,were do I begin.    1. Time-I ordered these brushes on Thursday and got them today via express mail which was great timing. I needed these for a makeup consultation today.    2. Quality-my client loved the way the brushes felt on her skin during the makeup aplication and I loved the fact that these brushes did not shed during the whole process.    3.Cleaning these brushes is great and I am happy that there is a company that wants to prolong the life of your brushes.Sigma makes a great product and makes sure clients are happy with brushes and other accessiories.    Overall 5 stars for Simga Makeup,you will be getting  more of my business</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase quality make-up brushes for a while but was not willing to pay the ridiculous prices for Mac brushes.  I did a lot of comparison shopping with Mac brushes and also Sephora brushes.  I took a chance on this set because of all of the great reviews and the VERY reasonable price.  Let me tell you, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!  These brushes are the exact same quality as the Mac brushes.  I absolutely love them!  They make me look flawless!  I have already recommended them to several friends!  If you want amazing brushes for a reasonable price, BUY THESE!!  You&#x27;ll be so glad you did!</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for exactly the right price. I&#x27;ve bought brushes from amazon that were half the price of these but they are also of terrible quality. These are just perfect and not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Recebi os pincéis da Sigma. Adorei, são macios e firmes. Sem dúvida o pincel f50 é revolucionário para Base ou o que quiser passar com ele na face. Looks incríveis serão feitos com eles. Valeu messssmoooo!!! Além disso chegou rápido, comprei no Amazon como sempre estou satisfeita.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  I did follow the instructions for when they arrived.  I washed them in baby shampoo &amp; water.  I actually got the instructions on how to wash &amp; maintain beauty brushes off the internet.  Simple instructions for me.  These brushes are beautiful &amp; well worth what I paid for the.  I like having instruments that help me take the most basic of tasks &amp; make it more fun.</li>
    <li> I got my brushes only 4 days after placing my order!  I read the reviews and did some research before buying these brushes.  I own a Mac brush kit and other high end brushes and was curious to see how the Sigma brushes would hold up. . .  Well, I am happy to report that they are awesome!  Beautiful and high quality!  As good, if not better than, the Mac brushes.  I love my Mac brushes but I don&#x27;t love them more than the Sigma brushes.  In fact, I wish I knew about the Sigma brushes before I bought my Mac brush kit since they are of the same quality and much more affordable!  You don&#x27;t have to pay more to get a better product. . . at least when it comes to make up brushes!  I am a Sigma brush fan and will order more in the future!  My only request is that the professional brush kit come in the beautiful colors offered in the container kits! I will definitely buy more brushes from Sigma!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much! They are so soft and hold so much product on them. I got what I paid for!</li>
    <li> So this is actually my first complete set of makeup brushes that I have ever gotten. Before I purchased this item I have already read some reviews and, if not all, most of them highly recommended this product. Guess what? THEY ARE RIGHT! I&#x27;m am so glad that I got this set of brushes and they are really well made. On top of this one, I also bought another set of Sigma brushes, the face brushes, and they were also amazing! Although there is only one problem, the Sigma powder brush is kind of out of the loop. And I have realized that it is not only me, many other customers who have bought this said also loved EVERY single brush EXCEPT for the powder brush. But overall, I still think that it was a great deal compared to MAC&#x27;s set which is ridiculously pricier. I would definitely recommend these set of brushes and I&#x27;m probably going to buy another set just because I love them sooo much!</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised when I receive the kit because the brushes is super soft, and very good quality, they made from really really soft hair and best wood, made me feel so exciting when I got it, I will continue buy more Sigma brushes in the future, anyway, as a beginner learn how to makeup, you should own this set, it&#x27;s valuable with acceptable price.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are exactly the same as Mac brushes and way cheaper! I highly recommend these brushes for your makeup kit! They are soft just like Mac brushes! They work wonders for all faces! Get yours today!</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes they are perfect ! I love how they look and feel. I tried them for the first time and they made me look like I have professional makeup on . they help me make my straight strokes perfectly and contour my face amazingly .I don&#x27;t know  I lived without them !!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good brush set for a really long time. I wanted really a good value for money and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on it. And I didn&#x27;t want to buy cheap ones as it&#x27;s just waste of money. I was eager to get really good brushes for an excellent makeup and I&#x27;m certain that I finally accomplished my goal. This set is really amazing! Brushes are very soft. They don&#x27;t smell as cheap brushes do. And also I received my set with an extra brush (for blending)  as a gift!     The only thing that I didn&#x27;t consider ahead is the brush bag. Mine were packed in a small transparent bag but I cannot keep them in it. So just keep it in mind))</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic!     I had been looking for a while and doing a lot of research on line for the best brushes for my money. These had great reviews so I decided to give them a shot. I just got them today and they are better then i expected by far! Not only are they very fairly priced but they are incredibly soft and awesome brushes to work with. The 12 piece professional brush set has everything i will need. I will forever be a sigma user!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!!! I have a couple high end brushes, but have never had a complete set before- these are great! I absolutey love them.  I would highly recommed these brushes to anyone!</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes, they are spectacular.  My face wouldn&#x27;t look the same without them, brushes really do make a huge difference.  I was concerned at the beginning, since two of the brushes did shed and discolored after the first wash.  Right now, the discoloration has stopped and the shedding has almost stopped on the large powder brush. Later on, I will definitely order more Sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, My order arrived one day earlier than expected and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I just started playing around with make up and thought it was time to buy good brushes. MAC prices do not help with you&#x27;re a beginner. I saw a girl suggesting this brushes on Youtube and boy I am glad I listened to her. This brushes are amazing and they feel soooo soft, I want to play with them all day. I already told all my girlfriends about it and told them to buy it too. Now that I am learning techniques I will definitely be buying more Sigma brushes. LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVE THEM!!!!</li>
    <li> so i was super excited when i got my sigma brushes! it came SOO nicley packaged which is a plus for me! they were all good no problems so far. then i washed them. thats when it went downhill. only onee brush broke &#x3D;( but i managed to out it back together. after that my excitment decreased. but now its been almost a month and none of them show signs of breaking so i am well pleased.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist these brushes are a definite deal. I&#x27;d read good reviews about these brushes so I decided to take a chance. They&#x27;re priced reasonably and a free gift was included. Sold! I&#x27;m happy with the quality and they don&#x27;t shed like others tend to.</li>
    <li> Sigma is overall an amazing company. Their packing is great, they are super helpful, and their shipping is so quick. I ordered this brush set on December 25 and recieved it on the 29th. The brushes are amazing quality and I don&#x27;t think I can live one more day without them. I have tried other Sigma brushes before, and they are also really great. Do not ever be hesitant in purchasing these brushes, they are soooooooooo great.</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes today, overall these brushes are pretty nice, feels soft. Compare to the MAC brushes I own, they are somewhat close in look and feel, but MAC brushes slightly softer than singma brushes, I haven&#x27;t use Singma brushes yet, so this review is just based on the outlook and feel. I will do a full review once I have used it.  The brushes came to me on time, I am pretty satisfied about the delivery and def. will recommend this brushes to others.</li>
    <li> I just received these 12 brushes and they are awesome. Great size and easy to handle. The packaging they were sent in was really nicely done. I would recommend this set of brushes to anyone who uses makeup.</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes! If you need precision tools for getting the right look you are after, get these brushes!</li>
    <li> Definitely one of my best make up related buys.    If you&#x27;re reading this, perhaps you were like me, once upon a time, thinking you&#x27;d like to splurge a little on some quality makeup brushes, but deciding between splurging a little for these Sigma brushes or perhaps spending way more on some MAC brushes (and still get way less than 12.  Perhaps this review will help.    Firstly, the brushes are nice and soft.  Not itchy in anyway.    Secondly, I am no makeup pro.  I simply do not have the skills.  Or so I thought.  The effect of these brushes inclusive of the different permutations and combinations of this set actually gave me different looks, all of them great.  What really helped with this part was looking at the videos found at Sigma&#x27;s website (especially the &#x27;basic&#x27; video).    Thirdly, the use of these brushes has cut down my makeup application time immensely.  (Sleep is good for the skin, so I&#x27;ve heard).    Finally, these brushes actually enabled me to use way less product than before.  So I&#x27;m using my &#x27;fancy&#x27; makeup everyday, guilt free.    They dried very quickly after washing and in the same shape as before (followed the instructions given to me by Sigma Beauty). I&#x27;ve yet to see even one frayed hair from these brushes.    I loved these so much that i bought the F80 and the F82, and will surely be buying more Sigma products in the future.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted Sigma brushes for forever since MAC brushes were out of my price range. The package came fairly quickly and with superb packaging. The brushes themselves are very nice and soft. I liked how the brush tips were individually wrapped on the bigger brushes to keep them safe. For 12 brushes at this price was definitely a steal!</li>
    <li> The brushes are awesome.  They arrived here in Brazil faster than I was expecting.   Congrats from Sigma and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are so soft!  The make up goes on effortlessly and it looks great!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a Make-Up Artist i have searched high and low for good quality brushes and now ive found them! Was so pleased to recivie my brushes within a week, well before the estimate delivery date. I was very HAPPY to recive the parcel today, that ethusiastic and excited to get home and open the pacel I reversed the car into the bin in the drive way! lol and now have a a small dent in the back panle of the car... :( BUT SIGMA BRUSHES CHEERED ME UP AND NOW I CANT WAIT TO USE THEM :)  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, so soft and great quality! Will for sure order more! There are the perfect amount brushes for my everyday makeup use! Sigma is amazing!</li>
    <li> After getting a lot of hints from my girlfriend that she really wanted these brushes, I decided to buy these brushes as a Christmas gift for her. At first I thought these brushes were very pricey. Still, I got to say, they look like high end bushes and considering you get 12 brushes, it&#x27;s actually a pretty decent deal. It sounds like sigma brushes have a lot of popularity on youtube so for any males out there that may be reading this and looking for a gift, these are a cheaper alternative to buying ridiculously expensive mac brushes without sacrificing much quality. Overall, my gf said she loved them. These are some things she told me to write in this review: The hairs are very packed,soft, and hold/apply makeup very well. They give you an airbrush finish. Make sure to wash the brushes very well with baby shampoo and water. She also said that the \\&quot;Duo Fiber F50\\&quot; and the \\&quot;E40\\&quot; brushes are her favorite. By the way, I also bought her the Dry n Shape and she says it works very well and that in particular she likes that it helps keep the shape on her brushes. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy so I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> overall, i love these guys.  they&#x27;re so easy to use.  whether i use cheap or expensive make-up, these brushes do the trick.  i&#x27;m giving them a 4 only because i experience a little fading of the color with the stipling brush and a little hair fall with the contouring brush.  but, everything else is great. :)</li>
    <li> I received the brushes within 3 days after making my purchse.  They were real easy to wash and they are soft.  For the price I paid and the quality of the brushes this was a great deal.  I have told all family and friends about the brushes.</li>
    <li> The kit has a great variety of brushes. They seem pretty sturdy, but then again I&#x27;ve only owned them for about a week. The only complaint I have about the brushes are that the bases seem to be made of plastic, which worries me because i feel like they will fall apart quicker than a more expensive brush. The packaging they came in also seemed pretty cheap as well. It seems that over the years sigma has been hiking up their prices and lowering the quality of their brushes. But overall I think it was worth the money, I mean its 12 high quality brushes for 90 bucks. It can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST BRUSHES I&#x27;VE EVER USED NICE &amp;&amp; SOFT EASY TO CLEAN I JUST LOVE THEM!!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
    <li> I love my Sigma brushes! I use them everyday and they&#x27;ve brought so much more life to the makeup looks I tried to create before owning these. It was definitely money well spent and I will not hesitate to order from Sigma Beauty a second time!</li>
    <li> I have never really invested in a good set of brushes until now, and I had brushes that lost bristles, were not particularly soft, and sometimes poked my face. This became extremely aggravating when I put on eye makeup!    After watching several youtube videos, I realized that most of the girls used Sigma brushes and I figured I&#x27;d give them a try. I had no idea there was such a big difference in brushes! These brushes are so incredibly soft! They wash well and are soo much better to apply makeup. Plus now I have a complete kit for putting on my makeup - no more reusing brushes that already have other colors on them. It really does make a big difference. The only reason I give the 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they are a bit pricey (even with the great quality) and shipping took awhile. All in all though I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 12pc brush set from Sigma on a Friday and had them delivered to me the following Wendsday! I opend the package and the brushes were in a pretty black bag. Each brush had its own protective case on it. I have used the foundation brush and the  blush brush and I love them. The brushes were so soft and good quality. From a scale 1-10 I would give the price of the brushes a 9. The pakaging which the brushes came in a 9. And the brushes alone I would defenitely give it a 10! Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I am the love makeup and for the longest time I could not find soft brushes that applied smoothly and with great coverage. These brushes really do make it much easier and faster to put on makeup because it applies so evenly the first time. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I recieved my brushes and opened them up! They are SO NICE, and work really well and are very soft! Definetely the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> After first hearing about sigma and their products on city and makeup&#x27;s youtube channel, i began to get a bit curious, and before i knew it it seemed everyone was using them. I am typically a drugstore beauty product kind of girl, however, the brushes that i was currently using were pretty much awful. they were shedding, and the bristles were so rough. it was horrible, somedays after doing my eye makeup my eyelids would actually be red and irritated from the roughness of the bristles. . After a while i finally decided to splurge and make the purchase. I could not be happier!!!!! the brushes are so soft, and do not shed at all, they are very good quality! To start my sigma collection i purchased the sigma beauty essentials kit, and separately i purchased the sigma F80(flat top kabuki). the packaging was very secure and very cute. Shipping was also decent, i ordered my brushes on a holiday, and received them only 4 days later. This product i worth every penny, as is the service. I am VERY satisfied with my purchase and i have nothing bad to say. . . .I will definitely be making more purchases from sigma in the near future!!</li>
    <li> This is my first nicer brush purchase and my friends have been telling me about the Sigma brushes for a while that they are great brushes for the value and I think I am tending to agree. I have been using them for about a week now and can definitely tell a difference from the drugstore brushes I have purchased in the past and I think they are a great starter set for someone getting into makeup. It is nice they come with a little guide and how to care for them and I would recommend them for sure so far.</li>
    <li> This is a really good deal. You get SO many brushes for such a small price. The quality is magnificent. Get it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.  They are good for beginners because they have what they are to be used for on the handle.  Very nicely packaged.  Very soft, professional looking.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several sigma brushes in the past and decided to buy a whole set. It is such a good deal for great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> I have been seeing and hearing about sigma brushes through youtube but never got the chance to buy one until my cousin gave me a F50 as a gift a month a go. And since then, I really wanted some more. So I ordered the whole set and was so psyched when I received it. All the brushes seems so well built, soft and dense. My favorite will be the F50 and F30! These set is affordable and soooo awesome! I might need to keep my other brushes cause I think I found my new love! :)</li>
    <li> I have always used cheap make up brushes but recently decided to spend the money and try Sigma brushes. I have heard so many good things about them. I absolutely LOVE them! Totally worth every penny. I will be purchasing more brushes very soon.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase with Sigma, I was referred to them thru a friend who is on You Tube. These brushes are amazing! I have really been missing out on proper makeup application. This set has a combo of natural bristle brushes and synthetic, I will be using every one. The powder brush is so luxurious, great contour brush, great precision eye brushes, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about them except I&#x27;m very happy I made the investment in this set! I highly recommend this set to anyone who has been working with subpar brushes and hasn&#x27;t been happy with applying makeup in the correct way. I&#x27;m going back to purchase some for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I just bought these brushes and they are amazing! The delivery was extremely fast and I was very happy with how the brushes work and the quality of them. It was a very good deal considering how expensive other brushes are. The quality matches, if not exceeds, the other brushes! I would reccomend these to anyone (and I already have!)</li>
    <li> Good brushes, but they&#x27;re expensive.  You could buy a bit better brushes at sephora (their brand), but buying them individually might cost a bit more.  Brand name brushes like Laura Mercier will be better but a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> I´m so happy to receive my package earlier! This brushes are exactly what I want! it´s just i need. I´m make up artist and i´m sure i enjoy it!. Excellent product, shipping and delivery. Great seller. Thanks a lot. Congratulations</li>
    <li> My brushes shipped very fast when I ordered them. I have had them for six months now and they really hold up. I wash my brushes with baby shampoo every night after use. I am not a make-up artist, but I have learned through online videos how to correctly use each brush. I personally think these brushes are better than the MAC bushes.If you wash them often they will hold up and the application of your make-up  will work better. I am glad that I got such a wide range of brushes for this price, because I can use different brushes for different techniques. If you want to have a professional look to your make-up, then get these brushes and watch online videos. I am constantly complimented on my make-up now that I have taken the time to learn how to properly apply it. I can do a natural or drastic look depending on the event. The set gives me all the tools I need.Also, these brushes are so soft. Now that I have the brushes, I know that they were well worth the money. Here I am six months later still loving my brushes. I hope you enjoy them too!</li>
    <li> Brushes are amazingly soft and easy to use. If you are a makeup lover, you should try this brushes, they really make the difference when applying the products. This brushes help you to blend so much better the product on to your skin/eyes , creating a more natural effect.</li>
    <li> I just got my brush set, it is good quality and great selection !!! I love it.  I definitely recommend this to my friends. Good price as well.</li>
    <li> I recieved these brushes about a week ago and I was very pleased with the quality of the brushes. I definetly will be buying another set! I have so many brushes and these brushes are very nice considering you get a whole set for such a good price. These are great to compliment any set of brushes you already have if you dont want to cough up all the money to get more expesive brushes. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Came quickly, brushes so soft!!! IN LOVEEEE!!!! Totally would recommend to a friend!!!! :) Do not hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes set i have used , and i recommendet for all, it&#x27;s sach a lost not traying tham  Love my sigma brushes</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of make up nor buying make up products. But, I&#x27;m getting older and feels that i have to invest in things like this- story goes i buy quality over quantity. Did some research on other reviews of make up brushes that are good. And willing to invest in these brushes. for the price i guess it will have to do. came in their own plastic wrap over the handle. and a more durable plastic wrap around the hair. which i think is great to use for travel...but it slips off too easy. (recommend using some other material to protect it) the black handles are light- the wood material feels a little too hollow for me. (but that is because i have been working with art and like heavier brushes) when i received the brushes I got so excited when they came i swore i counted 13 brushes. But really there are 12. Anyways these brushes are soft. Material wise they are good quality. Compared to my other brushes they are durable and soft- and hopefully does not shed as bad as some would say. But i haven&#x27;t used it yet. I admit however, for future I would buy these again but not for me (because i would have my own set). I would buy this again for my little sister. These brushes and the value they come in gives a little push/hope for my little sister to work harder in high school. Better grades mean better gifts from older sis. So I&#x27;m excited for her and look forward to her end of the bargain. If she does get good grades then more than likely i would buy the set again in the near future. but for now, these brushes are soft and well perform great for me.</li>
    <li> I love all MAC cosmetics and all of their brushes, I mean who doesn&#x27;t. But for one brush they want to charge you $30 for just one. That&#x27;s way to much to spend. These brushes are well made and very high quality!!! My favorite is the stipling brush. I just love applying my foundation with it. And yes, I am going to receive a complimentary gift for providing this feedback, but they aren&#x27;t forcing me to give 5 stars and a good review. This is totally my own opinion on these spectacular brushes. My cost all together was $98 and some change including regular shipping. It was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I was really needing a good makeup brush set but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot. These brushes are definitely comparable to MAC brushes but for less!  Ive had no problem with shedding and love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I got this Kit not sure what to expect, I had read great reviwes so I was hoping for decent quality. I was happily surprised, these brushes are equivalent to MAC brushes and I feel that the E55 and E65 are even better than MAC&#x27;s. I highly reccomend these brushes over any other and you can&#x27;t really beat the price.</li>
    <li> I was so shocked to know that exactly a week after i ordered my brushes, they came in!!! I was ecstatic to know they had finally came. Before I was debating whether I should get sigma brushes or not, but eventually I made up my mind and I do not regret this purchase. Brushes were good quality and I know when it comes to using something on my face, it has to be of good quality and sigma brushes definitely are. I love them!! I even custom made my own jar to place my sigma brushes along with the purchase of brush guards which protect your brushes. I would recommend this product to everyone especially if you are debating whether to buy them or not, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many brands for make up brushes but sigma is the best, the brushes are soft and my make up looks better thanks for sigma</li>
    <li> I recieved these brushes this christmas as a gift and I love them. The bristles are very soft to the touch. I would recommend them. This  set comes with every brush I need and they are so beautiful. I love them so worth the price!</li>
    <li> Sigma is well worth the money. The brushses feel soft and apply well. I feel like with brushes you get your money&#x27;s worth. I am really in love with the beauty of the packaging and the quality of the brushes. This is my first set so I am excited, but I know that I have some brushes that feel tough and they are new but these feel so incredible. By the way I ordered last week and got the brushes in 3 business days so super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, I had been saving up my money to get them. They have their pros and cons, but more pros. The pros are they apply your makeup very nicely and they come packaged very nice and neatly. Cons are they do shed at first, but they get better as you use them. Though I loved these brushes, I do think it is kind of ridiculous that I had to come on here and leave a review just to get my free gift.</li>
    <li> I am a male, and I bought these brushes for my teenage daughter. This review was written by her and all of what she said is her honest opinion.  To start off, I&#x27;m just gonna say that I love these brushes. They&#x27;re super soft and durable and they make your makeup look flawless. I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in the way my makeup goes on since purchasing these. After using these brushes, it makes me want to go try out the rest and see how they work. I think the price is a little bit expensive, but the brushes are such high quality and so amazing that it makes up for the price. I&#x27;m about to try the synthetic face brushes, so I&#x27;m excited to see if they&#x27;re as great as the twelve professionals brushes. Everyone hypes about these brushes and I can definitely see why! I recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone who uses makeup and is in need of some good brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  They work so well.  I am so glad I bought these brushes.  They make putting on make up so much easier.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes in today and had to try them out, i was so excited! i heard these were the best so i ordered them to try them out for myself. They are all amazing i couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes. The blending brush has to be my favorite! it does wonders! the brushes were shipped and arrived on time and in perfect condition. I love them and recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this brushes!!! they are amazing and with a great quality!!! it is my first set and it has everything that I need!!!, brushes for my foundation, concealer, powder, blush and eye shadows!!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered these Sigma brushes for my make-up art... I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of brushes, but NONE have ever been as amazing as these. They are flawless for make-up application. You can tell that the quality is luxurious and long-lasting. I rave about these brushes to everyone I know. If you are a serious make-up lover, or just prefer the finer things in life these brushes are the way to go! Not only are they awesome, but they are affordable for the usage you get out of them. I cherish these Sigma brushes. I would definitely recommend them to any beauty guru and beauty lover!</li>
    <li> This set is the best quality and value you can find. I looked everywhere and the sigma set has the best brushes for a relatively good price. You get the essentials for everything you could want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted sigma brushes and I finally gave in! LOVE IT SO MUCH! Its great for beginners and pros! These brushes are like MAC brushes but for a better price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are like no other. They are worth the money for the quality they provide ! Ladies &amp; Gents spend the money. Treat yourself dont cheat yourself</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law and when I received them, I was so impressed by the quality and look of these brushes, especially for the price. It was hard not to keep them for myself! Needless to say, it was a very popular Christmas gift! Great makeup brushes!! 10 out of 10</li>
    <li> i got my sigma beauty essential kit, the brush bristles are a very good quality for flawless makeup application. i highly recommend this for all the girls who wants to invest for good makeup brushes! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I live in Brazil and always had to buy splitted unitary brushes. This kit fullfils all the requestes being a more than an essencial pack. Perfect to those who wants to start making up themselves and those who intends on improving the technique. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I waited several weeks to write this review to make sure I actually tried the brushes. I haven&#x27;t had many hairs fall out of my brushes during cleaning, the only thing I noticed was the dye running on the two-toned stipling brush when I washed it the first two times. Since then it&#x27;s been okay and still looks good!</li>
    <li> First of all - let me say that I&#x27;m soooo disappointed that I purchased these brushes from this seller. If you are thinking of buying Sigma Brushes, I will tell you that it will be a GREAT purchase ONLY if you get the REAL one! BUT if you get to be a victim of fake items then that&#x27;s another story! I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m leaving this feedback to the seller or the item. But since I got the fake one from this seller - I would say that it&#x27;s ashamed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big brush with the essential kit from Sigma is in hard cover NOT plastic and that&#x27;s the first thing I checked when I got my set and of course it&#x27;s not and the brushes feels soooo different. Same thing you&#x27;ll get from Walmart for $3 except they put Sigma&#x27;s name on it. I&#x27;m frustrated that I have to return this item which I have to pay for the shipping when the price of this in here is soooo close to the original price from Sigma&#x27;s online price which is $98 with FREE GIFT and you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it&#x27;s Authenticity! Now because I wanted to save $10, I have to send this back and wait for my money back before I can buy the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma&#x27;s Brushes are Great! I love the ones that I own and purchased from their website - however for this particular seller/Amazon. Bah! Save yourself the trouble BUY from Sigma&#x27;s online store!!!</li>
    <li> The item great quality and price worth buying it , I am happy for what I Paid and what I have got</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this brushes for so long that I don&#x27;t want to use them but they feel so good I cant help it</li>
    <li> I have tried many brushes over the years, but I haven&#x27;t had any to give me the same effect as Sigma Brushes. First off, though, the brushes came earlier than I expected. The delivery time was between 21-26. I was expecting them to come the 24th, maybe the 25th, but they arrived on the 21st!!! I was so excited when I opened the package to see how nice and proffesional they came, and the brushes were really soft. I washed them as recommended, and no shedding!! I used the pencil brush and my shadow applied beautifully. I couldnt have ordered a better set at such a great buy. I definitely will be ordering more brushes in the future.:)</li>
    <li> Sigma is the closest quality brushes that you would get to MAC. As a makeup artist, I only want the best quality for my clients faces, and I know I wasn&#x27;t mistaken with Sigma. The brushes are soft and suple. This kit especially was exactly what I was missing from my makeup kit. So worth the price!</li>
    <li> I just brought Sigma Beauty Essential Kit, it is Ammmazing!! :) I absolutely love this product. It arrived quickly and is great to use. I have thrown all my old brushes out now. Once again its amazing Im very happy! :) xoxoxo</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about these brushes before I purchased them and I have to say that they do live up the reviews.  They are incredibly soft and have a nice weight to them.  I have only used MAC brushes in the past so quality was of utmost importance since I was using birthday money for these.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using them and I may be purchasing another set for my daughter now that she is getting into makeup.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes a few days ago after reading many reviews! These brushes are amazing, I just received them today and rushed to use them! None of the bristles shed and they are very sturdy! I look forward to using more sigma products and am very satisfied with the set I received! They are very, very soft and they work better than my sonia kashuk brushes!</li>
    <li> I was delighted to receive this brush set in the post recently. I have washed my brushes as instructed and on first use they feel so soft on the face. I like the range of brushes provided, although I wish a kabuki brush would have been included in this set. I&#x27;m looking at the price as a worthwhile investment for something I would like to keep and use for many years. I am not a makeup guru or even an enthusiast but I think a good quality brush set is essential in any girls makeup collection.</li>
    <li> For the longest time I have been wanting to buy brushes for my makeup. I have done a lot of research and these brushes came up a lot. Mac has always been to expensive for me and I wanted to find good brushes that came close and if not better! The wait is finally over. I am absolutely in LOVE with these brushes. They are so soft and feel wonderful on your face. They put on your makeup amazingly. When I need new brushes I definitely am going to get more of these! Thank you for making my time to put makeup on enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 12 set Sigma brushes as I needed a set for freelance work and I was sooo excited to get them. The quality was amazing (just as good or better than dept. store brands) and the mini guide on how to use each brush is awesome.  I was delighted to see that some of them were made from actual hair, wood, shiny metal!!    I recommend these for personal or professional use :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been contemplating for so long on whether to buy these.  I was on the fence on whether to buy this set or a set from Sephora.  After reading the reviews, and also watching the youtube videos saying that they are comparable to Mac brushes, but at a fraction of the cost, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a month now and they work great! One thing though is that the angled blush brush is still shedding. None of the other brushes shed, but this one on occasion sheds a few hairs.  Also I wish with this set came a feather brush, however it does not look as if Sigma makes one.</li>
    <li> When i receieved these brushes i was just expecting them to come in a box like everything else that you orser, nothing special, but when i received the brushes they were beautifully packaged in a sheer black drawstring bag so you could see the product you were getting.  inside also you recieved information about each of the brushes and what they recommended each to be used for, they gave you cleaning instructions and they also sent me a bonus travel size blendin E25 which i though was especially nice of them.  the brushes themselves are of superior high quality and are the same of MAC and i personally would rather buy sigma than mac because youre paying a lot less for almost a higher quality brush because so far my sigma bruses are better than the mac brushes that i have.  i am 100% happy with my sigma brushes and intend on purchasing more sigma products in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a professional makeup brush set for a reasonable price and this is it! These brushes will be perfect for both beauty makeup as well as theater makeup. This is a great starter kit for the aspiring artist since it has everything you need. I was very impressed that it came with a pamphlet showing the brushes and their uses as well as instructions on washing.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 14-almost-15 year old daughter. Here is what she says:    These brushes are absolutely amazing! They are so soft, and they apply makeup very well. I love the feel, the look, everything about them. This set is a very good starter set because it has the brushes you&#x27;ll need if you aren&#x27;t a proffesional makeup artist. These are the best brushes that I&#x27;ve ever used! I know they will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit worried about buying brushes on the internet but I found out that sigma brushes are the best ones. They are really soft and have a great design as well as they packaging.     This product has a really great quality and I am really happy with the results. I have still not tried every single one but my friends also  say that they are amazing.    What surprised me was that they had little instructions explaining all about  every single brush and how to clean them.    I also was really pleased because they were supposed to arrive on the 28 of January. Instead they arrived on the 4 January. The best part I didn&#x27;t pay more....    I received also a free gift that was a small brush from the new travel kit that you can also buy.  All in all it was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! They are just the right size and well made, completely sturdy. (which I appreciate as I have had my share of flimsy brushes before. I would definitely say that these are absolutely comparable to MAC brushes. I just wish this set came with a smaller blending brush as my eyes are not as large to always warrant using the E40, but I give it five stars for the bonus travel blending brush E25 surprise that I found in the envelope (despite complaining about the unavailable brush on the sigma site while the package was in transit. The brush was just what I wanted and needed, but wished it came in the normal size. All in all thanks Sigma!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set!  I am just starting to really experiment with makeup and these are just the tools that I need.  I guess like everything else, the tools that one uses is really important to get the best effect.  So far I have used the large powder brush, the flat bristle eye brush (for shadow primer) and most of the other eye brushes.  They do not disappoint.  They are definitely on par with Sephora&#x27;s premium brushes as far as I am concerned.  Also, they arrived in the mail 3 days sooner than I thought they would.  Love Sigma brushes and great customer service!</li>
    <li> Me encantan.  me llegaron super rapido y las brochas son de muy buena calidad y el pelo de las brochas super suavecito</li>
    <li> I received this set very fast. This is a great starter set for someone like me meaning that it has most of the brushes that I need and does not have any that I do not need. I can see how someone more experienced will need additional brushes, but for me it is just what doctor ordered and it also comes for a price that I would spent on 3 brushes.  Most brushes are great. They do shad some bristles which makes me sad. I love E55 MEDIUM SHADER BRUSH, F40 LARGE ANGLED BRUSH, E70 SMALL ANGLED BRUSH and the FREE E25.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, as I have just gotten into makeup. They are perfect and have every brush a beginner could need. The bristles are soooo soft, and they even sent me a travel size blending brush in addition to what I ordered. Extremely good quality compared to something you would get from a drugstore. Very satisfied with both the product and the store.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of great things about these brushes.  I was tired of spending way too much money on department store brand brushes so I decided to give these a try.  I am quite pleased and happy. These Sigma brushes work just as well as the expensive brushes I have. I will be buying Sigma Brushes from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing so many good things about the Sigma brushes and it seems like it&#x27;s the preferred choice of a lot of the makeup tutorials I&#x27;ve been watching so, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I was a little disappointed to find that the estimated shipping time was 6-11 days.  Imagine my surprise when I found them in my mailbox only 5 days after ordering, I was super excited!  The brushes seem to be of very high quality but, as I&#x27;ve only had them for about 3 hours, I can&#x27;t speak to their resilience. I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review if I&#x27;m not satisfied in the future!    -Sarah</li>
    <li> This is a great kit to start using good quality and long lasting brushes!  First of all because the brushes are soft and feel good on your face - and when you&#x27;re using something on a daily basis it should be a pleasant experience!  The fibers are nice and thick, securely attached, and can handle a good vigorous washing on a regular basis.  The handles are long allowing for comfort during application as well as smoother arcs and brush strokes overall.  If you&#x27;ve only ever used those little free brushes that come with your makeup kits, this will be a completely different experience.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived 4 days within order and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It was initially a toss up between the MAC brushes and the Sigma brushes. Having read the reviews, I went ahead with the Sigma ones which were pricey but still cheaper than MAC. The brushes are amazingly soft and there&#x27;s hardly any fall out. Application and blending is very easy. There&#x27;s also no awful smell you sometimes get with brushes. Good investment for any beginner!</li>
    <li> Received these brushes yesterday, and they are amazing! So soft, gorgeous look to them, and very comparable to MAC brushes. My sister owns some MAC brushes, and these feel as soft or softer! Makeup goes on smoothly and blends beautifully. Make sure to wash them before first use. These brushes do not shed much at all, just a few hairs when you first wash them, but that&#x27;s normal. If you are on a budget and still want amazing quality brushes, Sigma is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I have to say that i loved the brushes so much!!! They&#x27;re amazing, just what i expected and i cant wait to purchase more! They all do their work to the perfection. I wish i knew how good they are and would have bought them a while ago. I recommend everyone to get them and see how nice they all work, i have no regrets forget about other brands SIGMA is the best ever! Im so happy to finally have them and enjoy doing my makeup everyday its amazing. So everybody \\&quot;WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???</li>
    <li> i recently got my brushes in and i absolutely love them! Definitely worth getting! they are packaged with care and the quality of them is amazing!</li>
    <li> Finally i have makeup brushes!! Yes i did not have a brush kit untell NOW , i had three brushs only! 1 for blush and 2 for the eye! But when i saw sigma brushes on the youtube i decided to order them and i&#x27;m so happy really i&#x27;m glad that finally i have a set of complete brushes and the price is worth it , thanks sigma</li>
    <li> I did the research and decided this set was the one I wanted. When they arrived, one brush had some glue on the bristles. I contacted Sigma and they promptly rectified the issue by sending out a new brush and apologizing for the trouble. Over all, a purchase I&#x27;d repeat.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for about two months and really like them! They do their job, and they do it well. I have had a little problem with fallout on a few of the brushes, but nothing so bad that it interfered with their abilities. I love the round top kabuki and the eyeliner brush. These brushes are very good quality for the price and a very good investment in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, in my opinion, these brushes are a very good value, good quality, and they do their job well.&lt;br /&gt;Some people may think these reviews are biased since Sigma offers a free gift for those who write a review, but these are my honest thoughts. I would never rate something as five stars if I didn&#x27;t think it deserved it.</li>
    <li> I like how soft the brushes are. Just received them in mail today. The quality of the brushes are great!</li>
    <li> Received these brushes today from amazon. Used them for the first time and they&#x27;re Great brushes love them comparable to Mac!!</li>
    <li> Excellent Professional Makeup Brushes!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference between these brushes and the other ones I was using.  Not a bristle falls out.....and so easy to clean!  I bought the case that holds them and it keeps my brushes perfectly safe from wear and tear.  I bought the flat kabuki separately and am thinking of getting the angled one as well.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit 6 or so months ago and it has been sitting in its packaging in my room ever since.  You know how you have developed your own system of makeup application and you use certain tools and apply in a certain order?  I didn&#x27;t want to change what was working.  I used a couple of drug store brushes and a Mary Kay brush on my eyelids to get my eye makeup just so . . . Yesterday, I finally broke out the Sigma Kit and began putting its brushes to use.  It was luxurious.  It was like applying makeup with a chinchilla&#x27;s tail.  The makeup went on beautifully. The longer handles give me more control. I LOVE my Sigma brushes!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t get anything free and I&#x27;m not a professional. I&#x27;m a regular person that enjoys makeup, looking good with it, and applying it for friends. I&#x27;ve used sephora and coastal scents brushes prior to sigma. I have since replaced those with this set ( + a NARS smudge brush and sephora #55) that I purchased in the \\&quot;make me classy\\&quot; package that comes with a wonderful travel case!  I love these brushes, I could tell immediately that they were made well just by how the hairs were packed. They are soft and dense, they pick up the perfect amount of product and never wastes any. They apply precisely and the handles are a nice weight and size for great control. The travel case they came with doubles as two brush holders that I use to separate face and eye brushes. I have never felt so at ease about my weekly travels with my brushes crammed into luggage until now, they are snug and safe in this case! Great value at a decent price :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my new Sigma Brushes!!They are so soft &amp; better than my MAC brushes. It makes a whole difference on how my make up is applied, these are a MUST buy &amp; i recommend these to anyone looking for brushes.  My sister&#x27;s are even gonna buy them as well!! Thanks for the fast delivery too!!</li>
    <li> This is the best set of brushes anyone can get for the value. The duo fiber brush is my favorite so far. The set has all the essentials for a wonderful price. You can&#x27;t get any better than these.</li>
    <li> My Item came exactly when they said it would. The brushes were in very good condition, and are indeed top of line. It also came in attractive packaging, making the experience of receiving them even more rewarding.</li>
    <li> She loves them. In her words, \\&quot;Best gift ever!\\&quot; These are great brushes for the money, apparently. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase this brush kit. I lost my original kit during traveling and was in a huge bind before a make up show and needed to re-purchase my set after purchasing I e-mailed \\&quot;seller\\&quot; which is sigma beauty and the correspondent said she&#x27;d make sure I receive them within 2 days even though that was not a delivery option and I did I am super grateful I received them just in time for the show!! these brushes are amazing quality and I was so happy to not have to go to the show without them buy these brushes you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I&#x27;m having fun using each one of them. This is a great kit for anybody! Very happy with them!</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever owned! Definitely worth the investment, they blend better, haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle, has every brush I could need.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m far from a make-up artist, but these brushes help me fake it.  I have never had a foundation brush that does what this one does.  The powder brushes are so soft and provide even coverage.</li>
    <li> I must tell u girls thinking of buying this... DON&#x27;T!  The travel case is great... So is the flat top stiffler brush but those DO NOT come in the set.  I bought them separate.  This brush set was horrible.....  The glue connecting the brush to the wood wasn&#x27;t good I guess, my brushes kept falling off.  No heavy usage either... Idk...  Did I get a bad set?  Possible BUT not wasting hundred something dollars to find out again.  OVER HYPED ... All these good reviews are FISHY.</li>
    <li> Some brushes aren&#x27;t as good as others, but overall I love this brand. I&#x27;m talking about the powder brush but its a really good brand. Brushes don&#x27;t shed. My favorite is the angle brush, the concealer brush and the eyelid brush.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my girlfriend for Christmas. Since we wont be spending Christmas with eachother i gave them to her tonight. She LOVED them. She doesnt like spending money on nice makeup stuff so i figured since these were the best, she deserved them. I bought them on a sunday and received them 4 days later. SUPERRRRRR fast. Highly recommend these. :)</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushes. I&#x27;ll admit that I was a little skeptical in the beginning, because the hair looked like it could possibly be harsh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are super soft and apply makeup really wonderfully. I swear by these brushes, and will never go back to using whatever crappy ones I used before Sigma.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! The quality is great and I now have a full set of brushes to cover my every need. I&#x27;ve been using them for almost two months now and the bristles are just as they were on day one. I won&#x27;t be needing new brushes anytime soon and when the time comes I&#x27;m definitely purchasing the same set again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003UNP20W Sigma Beauty Essential Kit]]  This is a group of brushes to be used for applying makeup that are as nice a set of brushes as I have found.  All sizes that work for a variety of applications from loose powder to applying eye makeup.  I love the brushes and there are plenty of themfor every use!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!! All other brushes I&#x27;ve used are so rough on my face and make me hate putting on make up. They also leave a cakey finish on my face and I can&#x27;t stand it. Sigma brushes are the best and make me feel beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes were worth it! The hairs of the brushes are soft and similar to MAC&#x27;s. I have always used MAC&#x27;s brushes, but this time I&#x27;m glad that I purchased the Sigma brushes! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I got mine and been happy about it since day one. The hair is so soft and the quality is excellent. I have been loyal to mac brushes for so long, but these are defiantly beat up the price ... I recommend it and will buy the rest for sure !</li>
    <li> I bought this Beauty Kit for my girlfriend as a Valentine Day gift - she didn&#x27;t leave me the possibility to give her the gift in time, though :)  My girl is so happy with this kit - I can&#x27;t find the words to describe how glad was I to have chosen this one.  The brushes are very soft, just like silk. The handle is easy to grip, it leaves a feeling it&#x27;s really expensive.  I think this purchase is well worth its money, really decent buy!</li>
    <li> The price might seem high (this was what stopped me from buying, I received this as a gift), but it&#x27;s a great value for what you are getting. Every brush you could possibly ever need is in this set, and the quality is awesome.  I especially like the stippling brush - my foundation goes on very nicely and I now prefer this to using my fingers (it feels cleaner). The large powder brush is really soft and the shape is perfect for applying loose powders and bronzers. Very happy with the set.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes, very comparable to the MAC brushes. Got the package very quickly, brand new. Recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Do you know what Mac charges for brushes? It&#x27;s exorbitant. These brushes don&#x27;t shed, hold product, clean well and are reasonably priced. I use almost every brush in this set daily. It is most definitely worth the price and you won&#x27;t find better brushes elsewhere even if you pay more. Sigma is a truly fantastic brand. This kit comes with face and eye brushes in a variety of shapes and sizes that allow for a variety specific make-up styles and application. Yes. Yes. Yes.</li>
    <li> these brushes are very good quality brushes. use them everyday.I never need to grab for another brands brush. the product came very quickly with amazon.com. these brushes make me want to keep shopping with sigma:)</li>
    <li> This is my first set of professional makeup brushes and I am thrilled with the results.  Products are applied flawlessly.  And the selection of brushes in the set is quite broad.  There is a brush for everything I need to do my makeup.</li>
    <li> Great set. Good quality and nice variety of brushes. I would highly recommend it to any makeup enthusiast. Get it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved them! They were just what she wanted. They lived up to her expectations and more. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I watched a few reviews regarding these brushes and they were all great! I Love that they are comparable to MAC brushes, but without the high cost. I decided to give them a try and I absolutely LOVE them!! They are so soft and blend so nicely! I will def be making more purchases from Sigma!!</li>
    <li> most of the sigma brushes that i´ve ordered shed on me like crazy! everyone says they´re a mac dupe.. but i&#x27;m not too impressed with the quality...</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these brushes when I found them here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived very quickly, packaged nicely, and they were very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used a few of them so far,  but I have to say that I am&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with the purchase, and find them to be of good quality&lt;br /&gt;as well.  Would recommend these brushes to all.</li>
    <li> Please read this review carefully. I never order from Sigma.com because I have Amazon prime and can receive free shipping. I mean who wouldnt do that instead? So I ordered these brushes because I have always wanted them! The kit came without the little pamphlet that says what all the brushes do which was something I really wanted since I am not a pro at make up. I&#x27;m testing my skills in make up and as a make up artist so I bought the GOOD kit to do this. But a piece was missing. I asked if it was supposed to come with one because I have the Mr. Bunny travel kit which came with a pamphlet and all the reviews I watched had one. However, Amazon handled this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had these brushes for a little over 2 weeks and ONE, the Duo Fibre is already acting funny. My barrel is moving which I notice this morning. On the bright side, the brushes are soft and gorgeous. They do live up to the reviews they get with the exception of the Duo Fibre handle (but the bristles are lovely). I have had my Dup Fibre replaced BUT my advice is to not buy things from Etailz. My Travel kit handles were messed up as well. The writing started to come off and in my Sigma Essential Kit, the brushes say &amp;#34;Patent pending&amp;#34;. Etailz may be a great seller but I dont want to order from them anymore. Try using another seller if you want the kit. The kit is wonderful but if you can avoid the little things that may go wrong, please do.</li>
    <li> Most my brushes are from Mac. Thought I&#x27;d try this set after all the good reviews I read. And I&#x27;m not disappointed though I&#x27;ve only had them a short time these are great brushes and every bit as good as my Mac  time will tell if they hold up is good.</li>
    <li> Got them back in June. Have been using it for six months I love them. It a good investment to make. Before these sigma brushes I used drugstore brushes which always shed bristles and smelled bad after washing. I am so happy these don&#x27;t smell bad, very soft, good quality, the only brush I had problems with was the E40 which is the tapered blending brush. It fluffy and soft, but it shed bristles,the bristles tend to become frizzy( the bristles stick out from the actual shape). The metal part that attaches to the handle is kind of bent. I am not disappointed the brush came in good shape not considering it was bent. It is nothing big, I am bit OCD, it still gets the job done. Even after being frizzy it does a good job. Over all very good brushes. I love them and I am saving to get more brush sets by sigma. Considering the price and the amount of brushes you get it a good deal. Better then other make up brushes I have seen in the market. I did lot of research before getting these. The reason I put this review up six months latter was because I really wanted to test them out before I came to a conclusion. I would highly recommend them. (My favorites from the set are F40, F30, F65, E60, E55, E40, E05. The other brushes are great too, but I tend to reach for these the most on daily bases. Hope this was helpful for some of you hesitating to get them.)</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes.  I have other higher end brushes, but none that can compete with these brushes especially at this price.  I would DEFINITELY recommend these brushes to anyone who is serious about their make up.</li>
    <li> I Love,is my second kit from Sigma,is tremendous quality,&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,is work perfect .I will buy another for gift .love love</li>
    <li> My daughter says this is the best brush&lt;br /&gt;set ever. I use Bobbi Brown brushes&lt;br /&gt;and they are similar. They make a huge&lt;br /&gt;diffidence in makeup application.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my fiancee as a birthday gift. This set received really good ratings on Amazon and also comes highly recommended on youtube. My fiancee loves these brushes and have been using them for over 2 years now. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, arrived quickly.  So soft, feels so comfortable in my hand (love the weight of the brushes).  Happy that I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> These brushes are of high studio makeup tools quality and best of all, they cost so much less! All brushes are carefully individually packed. They even come in with a free travel brush! Best value!</li>
    <li> Brushes are my inspiration especially every morning when I wake up and ready for a new day. Your day can begin at the office, a class, or can end at some party, event or even a Friday midnight date... Wherever you go, whatever you do, brushes are always your indispensable tools! Brushes wake up my energy as well as my creation and imagination as an artist :))    I&#x27;ve been eagerly longing for a professional brush set. I have some M.A.C brushes (basic ones) and only use M.A.C. My strategy is that I just use some basic brushes from M.A.C and then wait for a good time when I can buy the complete set from them to fulfill my dream about those \\&quot;little silly pretty sexy things\\&quot;. I wish M.A.C could put their brush set on sale but until now those brushes are still too expensive. M.A.C brushes are wonderful, undoubtedly. But do you think that $45 for A blush/powder brush is reasonable?    The reason why I chose Sigma firstly because of its price: $79 for a 12 professional brush set. I can not wait for the sale from M.A.C anymore. After reading a lot of positive reviews from the internet, I decided to give \\&quot;a shot in the dark\\&quot; by ordering Sigma 12 pcs brush set. I really do not want spend money on junk things but on the other hand I tend to keep my mind open to new chances, new choices and options. $79 can be a considerable amount, but is is still affordable for a new experience or adventure.    And it turned out to be an exciting, wonderful discovery. My order came quite quickly (only 3 days after the order was placed). The brushes were packed nicely and professionally with all necessary information such as an instructional booklet, how to clean and maintain the brushes... The booklet is quite clear, smart and simple with condensed, short description and pictures of each brush as well as its function. You can read them in just 2 minutes, then read again in 1 minute, and then can easily remember or distinguish every brush. Absolutely no confusion. Just that simple.    Moreover,a nice surprise is a Sigma free gift (a travel blending white brush) included in the package. The brushes are so soft, some of them have natural bristles while some have synthetic bristles. Specially, the Duo Fibre F50 is the combination of synthetic and natural bristles. One more noticeable point is that THIS SIGMA 12 PCS BRUSH SET HAS ALL BRUSHES SIMILAR TO M.A.C&#x27;s. You can even compare them one by one. I really love the powder brush, the pencil brush and the blending brush from M.A.C and now I can find them and own them again with Sigma but with a much cheaper price.    Hopefully Sigma brushes will give me a good impression as its package has done - the impression of professional, detailed focus and good quality! I have tried some Sigma brushes with some new blushes and eye shadows I&#x27;ve just bought from NARS and Shiseido last week and the result is \\&quot;so far so good\\&quot; :)) The feeling and experience is not different compared to M.A.C brushes at all!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  They are soft just like MAC brushes and are way cheaper.  I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.  I highly recommend the Sigma brushes!!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes I don&#x27;t regret purchasing, the brushes are very soft but the only brush I have a problem with is with F50 DOU FIBRE because the hair fall out is crazy even if you wash the brush the hair still falls out. Besides that everything with the other brushes seems fine no problems what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to beauty beginners whom wants good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. All that you need in one package. They don&#x27;t shed and they apply makeup perfectly. I know they are on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s worth investing in your brushes cause they will last you a long long time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful. My eye makeup looks amazing. Shading makes a huge difference. Where were you SIGMA!  My friends want to know the secret 😄</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend $80 on makeup brushes, but when added up together with 12 brushes, it&#x27;s a great deal! The shipping came in great timing, and I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 months now. I wanted to be able to use them a while before reviewing. This is a totally worth it item (: When I got them I washed them before using them and the only problem I had with bleeding was with the big face brush and the stippling brush. Nothing too bad though. The eye brushes blend and pack nicely and the face brushes are really soft and good quality, i use them almost every day and they&#x27;ve held up strong. 5 stars! Thanks, sigma &amp; amazon!</li>
    <li> its nice kit ,, soft hair ,, the black grip is strong and the packing is cute and safe ,But I think that her hair is few little bit.</li>
    <li> I love Sigma Makeup and there brushes, after watching and reading reviews I knew I had to give them a try. When I got my brushes they were in excellent condition, on top of that I received a free travel brush. I use them everyday and they do the trick. I suggest people invest in these products because they are awesome quality.</li>
    <li> I owned a bundle of makeup brushes--both high end and drugstore.  However, this set clearly outperforms all of them, without question.  The brushes are super soft and I have experienced very little shedding, no more than normal.  My only complaint (if you can call it that) about these brushes is that I wished the set included a kabuki brush.  However, this can be easily sold by buying the kabuki separately--which I will soon be doing.  Love this product.  This would make a great gift for both those starting out with makeup and those who just want to try a new product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this professional brush set from sigma as a birthday present for my girlfriend. She was overjoyed when she opened the package.She says that the brushes are so soft and feel like real luxury:-)Before she didn&#x27;t have quality brushes, so that she said to me it appears to be a quantum jump. I really can recommend this brush set, additionally when you want to make your girlfriend happy!</li>
    <li> a friend recommended this brand to me and im a newbie when it comes to make up brushes, but so far so good. i love how its so soft. definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for makeup brushes for a long time. It&#x27;s really hard to find or buy a good quality makeup brushes especially if you live in a small town.  I watched a makeup tutorial on YouTube and the makeup artist has been using Sigma brushes. She mentioned that they are similar to MAC brushes and they&#x27;re soft and affordable. So I keep on searching on the net. Will a lot of people were amazed and how soft it is to use Sigma brushes on your face. So the search is OVER. I decided to order one in Amazon.com. I am absolutely in love with these brushes. They are soft and feels wonderful on your face. I would definitely recommend my friends to buy it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good quality. now I have my perfect essential kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a good quality product like this, better than MAC and other brushes I&#x27;ve used before, I&#x27;ll purchase again</li>
    <li> I bought these make up brushes because I was told that they were one of the best make up brushes you could use. . These brushes are well made.The kit was really put together nicely. You basically have every brush you need to apply your make up..... they wash up nicely too. I would definitely recommend this product to everybody who wears makeup.....This is the kit to buy for sure.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great set, but I wish I could swap out a couple of the brushes with some other brushes that would be more useful.</li>
    <li> I got my 12pcs brush set today!! And they are just what I expected them to be....PERFECT! M.A.C like quality for the price of 3 M.A.C brushes. Thank you Sigma this brush set was just what the makeup doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are synthetic, yet so soft and definitely comparable to the MAC brushes! These are the best brushes you are going to find for such a low price! Definitely worth it! Just check youtube for more in depth reviews and pictures!</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with the quality of this set. I love the smooth application that can be achieved w/ these, and the ability to really blend. These are a GREAT value. I&#x27;ll be back for the travel set! (Shipping was fast and the product came in a darling bag... and a freebie!)</li>
    <li> I got these Sigma brushes for christmas, and I LOVE them! Their so soft, so far they havent shed.  No weird smell, and they work VERY well. They are the same quality as MAC in my opinion, 5 stars in my opinion.  It also came with a free travel sized brush, AND cute packaging &amp; a card to how to clean the brushes &amp; all the names of the brushes :) Thank you sigma i LOVE THEM! Totally worth the price :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and have been buying my brushes individually for $20-30 a pop. So, when I came across this 12 piece set I decided to give them a try and added them to my wish list. Turns out I made a pretty good decision. The selection of brushes was exactly what I was looking for. Plus the quality was far better than I thought it would be. The bristles were all of good quality and they all came well packaged in plastic sleeves to maintain shape. It was a great deal. Now all I need is a new brush roll to hold them all.</li>
    <li> Here is my feedback...  1. They arrived early....even during Christmas shipping time. AWESOME!  2. They were all in protective covers to ensure they were not damaged. Whohoo!  3. They provided instructions for cleaning and use. Nice!  4. Some of the bristles were falling out. Sad!    Overall, they seem to be a great product. I would purchase from Sigma again.</li>
    <li> I am really happy to use my new Sigma makeup brush set. All the brushes are exceptionally soft both natural and synthetic. The Duo Fiber brush gives me a perfect airbrushed coverage. Large angled brush is ideal for me to apply blush and shimmers. All the eye brushes are of excellent size and shape, and really handy. I appreciate very much a Sigma free gift (a travel blending white brush) included in the package as well as a booklet with short description and pictures of each brush and its function. Cleaning instructions are also useful.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these nice-looking professional quality brushes for this quite reasonable price. Thank you, Sigma!</li>
    <li> I truly loved these brushes they are amazing they work soooo great make all my flaws go away i especially love the blending brush and the blush brush they are so great i would very much recommend so soft feels great when your using them.</li>
    <li> I have had my brushes for a month now and I am enjoying them. I have washed them a few times and they have held up with no problems. The bristles are soft and retain their shape even after washing. There has been minimal shedding but nothing out of the ordinary. I think this brush set is a great, affordable set especially for those just starting out wearing make-up but do not want to buy expensive brushes. I only wish they would include a kabuki brush with the set. But overall, I would recommend these brushes to anyone thinking about purchasing this set. It is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> So very happy that I made this purchase. This Brush set is outstanding, so much so, I shared this find with my daughter who has worked in the beauty industry for many years and she agreed that this Sigma Brush set is remarkably well made.</li>
    <li> I had been looking into buying these brushes for over a year prior to the purchase... And I am not disappointed AT ALL! They have very soft bristles, apply product beautifully, and they expaned my brush collection dramatically!!! In love!! I will deffinately be purchasing from sigma in the future!</li>
    <li> I first heard about Sigma brushes from a YouTube video and loved the review and price so much that I ordered them the next day. They are a little more expensive then a set you can get at a department store but you can really do so many things with the same brush that even if your not a professional you can do your make up like you are!</li>
    <li> I have read plenty of reviews about these brushes and i have to say i am pretty impressed. Shipping was super fast and they are great quality.  They are soft on my skin and do a great job applying makeup. Two of the brushes shed when i first washed them but have been fine since. I absolutely love these and am planning my second purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my fiance and she loves them. The order was expedited super fast and she said the product was top quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are SO SO SO SO much better than I expected.  Firstly, they are a great deal.  Secondly, they are fantastic quality.  And lastly, they look  extremely professional and will jazz up any make up collection.     I Will definitely be ordering this set for both my sisters, my mom, and any birthday, graduation, or celebration in general!!!  They are perfect for anyone from amateur to expert!!  And the set really does include everything you might need so all your bases are covered.     I hate to admit it but over the years I have become a make up snob and will spend lots and lots of money for a name brand product.  I went out on a limb and ordered this set and it is better than all my MAC brushes.  AND I saved roughly a hundred dollars!!!!  (if not more!!!!)    Bottom line, YOU NEED THIS SET!!  Even if you don&#x27;t think you do, YOU DO!!!!  If i could give it 10 stars I would!!!!!</li>
    <li> Oh goodness, I can&#x27;t even express how much I adore these brushes. I&#x27;d been looking at them for so long and finally decided to get them. Mostly what I wanted was the eye brushes because I already had face brushes that I liked, minus an angled brush (which I&#x27;d also been looking for!) There was no way that I was going to go to Sephora or Mac and buy their expensive brushes... unless someone was going to buy them for me, haha. I&#x27;d heard about these for a while and people said they were great alternatives.  Personally, I thought this set was the best deal. I really wanted the purple ones but realized that these were the same brushes, just a different color. I thought they were a great price for all you got with it...  These are super, super soft. Way softer than any brushes I&#x27;ve ever had. They&#x27;re good quality and nice to look at. I also love the little bag they came in. I plan on storing them in it when I travel (I can just put in my makeup bag). I also love how they include what you&#x27;re supposed to do with each brush. (:  Definitely recommend these brushes! I&#x27;d buy them again in a heartbeat (:</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were completely satisfied with the collection of brushes.  We only wished they came with something nicer to keep them in.</li>
    <li> The makeup brushes were a gift for my daughter who loves anything make up related.  She does extensive research before buying - the only thing that held her back on buying the brushes herself was the price.  That made them the prefect Christmas gift.  She will use them for many years.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE BRUSH SET! Really awesome brushes and the reviews are really accurate. Sigma has an amazing line of brushes and I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> Quality brushes .. a perfect collection .</li>
    <li> Love these. Highly recommended. Bought on advice from Jaclyn Hill and she knows her stuff!</li>
    <li> Really great brushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing 12 professional brushes,soft ,good for blending good for highlighting and  everything I love it.This is a good investment for the amount ,size,quality of this brushes you get the job done better than spend $$$ from professionals. If you don&#x27;t have it get it NOW.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! Super soft and easy to clean. Makeup goes on beautifully with them. Amazing amazing brushes!! I love them so much. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> A great variety of incredible quality brushes! Sigma never ceases to please...I wish that there were more eye brushes that were everyday brushes in the &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; kit, but the face brushes are incredible, and definitely have become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;. Worth spending the $$.</li>
    <li> Great product. I just got them in the mail and Love them already. It says to wash them before you use and I did. SOO soft. Just like Mac!!!</li>
    <li> I did not expect to receive my brushes before christmas day but to my surprise they arrived thankfully. I love the brushes. I have used my roomates for months and have contiplated purchasing them for some time now.  I finally decided to purchaase them and was excited to have a set of my own. I washed them as soon as i opened the package and used them tonight to prepare for the holdiay celebrations. Love love them definately reccomend them.</li>
    <li> I have used many types/brands of brushes for my makeup, but I wanted a complete matching set. Department store brands would be anywhere from $18-$45 per brush, so that was out of the question. The Sigma line is used often by makeup gurus in videos and blogs, so I thought I would try it out. My mom bought them for me for Christmas and I&#x27;m already in love with them! The large powder brush is AMAZING! The liner brushes are so precise, blending brush is a great density, and I&#x27;&#x27;m truly impressed. I&#x27;m so excited and can&#x27;t wait to use these for fun looks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mixture of Lancome Brushes, Sephora Brushes and E.L.F. brushes that are all worn out and dropping bristles. These brushes are a perfect mixture of natural and synthetic for both wet and dry products. Compared to MAC brushes and Sephora brushes, this is a great deal and the quality is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the brushes when I received them.  They were packaged very securly and arrived sooner than most of the other products I had ordered at the same time.  I am just starting my investment in quality makeup products and these brushes by far exceeded my expectations.  They are very good quality and seem like they will last a long time.  I am excited to start using them!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my sigma brushes, im glad they came quickly. Ive been learning how to do my make up more professionally, and these brushes are just the trick. They are equivalent to the popular \\&quot;m.a.c.\\&quot; Brushes except these are way more affordable! Im in love with them already!!</li>
    <li> Warning: Sigma reviews are probably a little bias since they offer a free gift for customers who leave reviews.  These brushes are nice, but for the money they cost, I was expecting a lot more. They are certainly not any better quality than the brushes at our local beauty supply store.  I was absolutely disgusted to discover that Sigma included a card with my purchase that says, \\&quot;A Free Gift For You!  Thank you for purchasing our products on Amazon.com....Please take a moment to rate us as a seller and write a product review...Send a copy of your comments and your Amazon.com order number to...to receive a FREE GIFT!\\&quot;  I never leave reviews, but this really bothers me since I just bought overpriced brushes based on their high Amazon ratings.</li>
    <li> Based on prior reviews, got convinced to buy this makeup kit; i was anxiously to receive them but after washing them, and using them twice; i did not got the results that i was expecting...  will rate a 4.</li>
    <li> Bought this item a week ago - the packaging of the item was different from the ones online - but that was stated by the seller. I&#x27;m still wondering if they are real or fake. So far, based on the images from the Sigma site itself, the brushes look exactly the same - the rings on the metal are the same number, the Sigma logo and typography are the same, the finish of the handles are even the same, and the \\&quot;USA\\&quot; part (from the brushes online), isn&#x27;t really supposed to be there anymore (if you check the photos from the actual Sigma site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I decided to test it against some of my Youngblood and Smashbox brushes. With regards to it&#x27;s fullness, it&#x27;s the same as my YB brushes. Length is good, fluffiness is good - quite soft, really. Tried it on my skin, it didn&#x27;t shed at all. Tried rubbing off the foiling from the handles, it didn&#x27;t come off - and finally, I tried washing it to see if the bristles would fall, or the colors would bleed, and it passed that too (there was no bleeding and no shedding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s fake or not (because it&#x27;s packaged differently), but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, they apply makeup to my face as nicely as my YB brushes, and the angled contour brush is even better than my YB one in getting product on my cheeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m quite happy with the product whether it&#x27;s real or fake.</li>
    <li> i received  the  brushes  early  than  i  expected! 10/10  for  the  shipment,superfast considering  that  im  from  europe.... i  would  say  the  brushes  are  impressive!they&#x27;re  really  soft  and  it&#x27;s  soooo  nice  to  the  skin.i  even  tried  all  of  it  and i&#x27;m  satisfied  with  it.am  not  really  particular  with  brushes  but  then  when  i  used  it, i  fell  in  love  with  the  result!my  make up  looks  diffrent and   it  looks  nice  and  natural.i&#x27;m  so  inlove  with  the  brushes  that  i  considered  buying  more.  the  only  downside  is  that  it  does shed  but  not  that  much.still  i  recommend  this  brushes.......</li>
    <li> I purchased a few Sigma brushes just to see if they were as good as people were saying.  I&#x27;ve had 4 individual brushes for over 6 months and I&#x27;m thrilled with them.  They are holding up with everyday use, they clean well and I&#x27;m so happy with them I decided to buy the whole set.  It&#x27;s so nice to find brushes reasonably priced that don&#x27;t have bristles that fall out and fall apart after the first few cleanings.  These will not be the last Sigma brushes I order.</li>
    <li> After hearing all of the YouTube gurus and friends and other make fiends rave about these brushes I decided to go ahead and get a set for myself. When they arrived with pleasantly fast shipping I couldn&#x27;t wait to examine them; and they are by far the softest brushes ever. Even the ferrule is amazing, it feels sturdy and solid unlike many other brushes I own. I love the fact that the package came in a cute bag and with cleaning instructions. When it comes to the application of make up with these brushes, a difference is most certainly noticeable; it looks flawless and even. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect large angled contour brushed and can finally stop now that I have F40 in my possession. These brushes are well worth the price and don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brushes, they are an amazing bargain. A lot of people don&#x27;t know this but the key to applying awesome looking make up starts with good brushes! I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. Thanks</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast. The brushes are really great. Soft  and easy to apply. Very reliable product at afordable price. [[ASIN:B003UNP20W Sigma Beauty 12pcs. Professional Brush Set]]</li>
    <li> I received my Sigma brush set last week, and while I havent gotten to use all the brushes yet, Ive been pretty pleased with what I&#x27;ve been using so far. I like the different brushes that are offered in the set. Ive bought brush sets before, but I think this is a good deal for the variety and style of brushes that you get. In the past my brush sets were always missing certain brushes that I needed, and i ended up buying single brushes for $15-$20 each.  With this set it has everything I need, and I dont need to buy any additional for a full set.    The only problem Ive had with the brushes so far is that some of them are shedding a bit. This can be really awkward, when using the eye brushes and they leave fine hairs that feel like eyelashes that got stuck in weird places.    My favorite so far is the eyeliner brush, I love this brush and it works much better than a sephora brush i previously purchased for $15.</li>
    <li> I have read plenty of reviews about these brushes and I found this brush set to be good quality. If you are a beginner, you should get these brushes. Not to mention these brushes are the best for professionals as well. They are so soft on your skin and you will be satisfied with their job applying makeup. Unlike other brushes, Sigma brushes don&#x27;t shed. You will be happy once you use the brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try these brushes for so long. Love them!!!!. The bristles are so soft and makes for great application. Great Deal Came right on time :)</li>
    <li> After extensive research to purchase my first make-up brush set I came Lyon the conclusion that I would purchase Sigma Beauty Set. The Bristles are absolutely amazingly soft even my husband and son were impressed!!! But.... I was very disappointed on how much they shed :&#x27;( I did everything they told me to do wash them prior to first use, was very gentle with them but they still shed. All the reviews and videos said they didn&#x27;t so that&#x27;s why I purchased them. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Would still recommend tho.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes...once i got them i washed them as said then i started using it and i fell in love...</li>
    <li> My daughter loved them</li>
    <li> First of all, fast shipping. One day earlier than the estimate date. I haven&#x27;t use them yet. But with brushes, Sigma also supplied information of how to clean up the brushes and how to maintain them in good shape. I like that. Make me use them with a good start.</li>
    <li> I ordered my brushes from Sigma around 3 weeks ago, I live in the Middle east, so 3 weeks was a fair enough time for it to reach. I love the quality of the brushes and think i will be recommending them to my friends so they would experience them for themselves.</li>
    <li> This brushes are awesome! I received them for xmas , and i LOVE them! Professional quality, and lots of variety! I would totally recommend these to all make up lovers out there!</li>
    <li> I am a Youtube junky and LOVE watching the beauty guru&#x27;s doing makeup tutorials and product reviews. Earlier this year, I decided that I needed a complete, matching, professional brush set. I had noted that in most of the videos I watched, Sigma brushes were being used. I placed my order on December 25 and received it today (December 30). I have already completed the recommended \\&quot;pre-wash\\&quot; and the brushes will be ready for me to use in the morning. I feel like a big girl now with my matching set! I know that I will be happy with the brushes and look forward to additional purchases in the future. Thanks Sigma!!</li>
    <li> The recipient was thrilled to bits with the quality.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes in the mail today (they arrived right on time) and the brushes were exactly what I expected and more! They are amazing quality, very sturdy and durable handles. The bristles on each brush were the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt. This was my first Sigma Brush order and I can definitely say it will not be my last. I highly recommend buying from Sigma is you&#x27;re just getting started in taking makeup seriously whether you&#x27;re doing makeup on others or for personal use. Great job, Sigma! I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed after opening my package from Sigma, was how beautiful it was packed. Impressive! I immediately cleaned my brushes using the Dry&#x27;n&#x27;Shape, and I love how quickly the bruches dryed and how they stayed in shape - the brushes will look like they are all new after every wash! The quality of the brushes are amazing, they are so incredible soft and I just love the feeling they give against my skin. I actually prefer this brushes to those from MAC. I love the design! Will absolutely go back to buy more stuff from Sigma!</li>
    <li> After going back and forth between MAC and Sigma brush sets, I decided to go with Sigma. I do have a few MAC brushes already in my arsenal, and cannot tell a difference between the two! These brushes are super soft, and I love the fact that the set comes with an instruction type manual explaining what each brush is used for. I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I could not afford the famous MAC brushes and I am NOT DISAPPOINTED! I&#x27;ve had them for over a year (and I&#x27;m just now writing this review. smh) and they do not shed, all of the bristles are still intact, and they do not irritate my face! I recommend these brushes to any one who is looking for quality without having to pay a ton of money.</li>
    <li> In love with my sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my sigma brushes. It was worth every penny. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews stating these brushes are fake.  10000% incorrect! These brushes are the real deal! How do I know? I bought a flat kabuki sigma brush from the actual sigma site and compared them. Ever little engraving is identical. I think this was a great investment and I&#x27;m happy to have bought them!</li>
    <li> I had some problems receiving it but lady from Sigma - Amazon helped me a lot and wrote with me the whole time. Finally I received the brushes. The are perfect. I use them I think almost a half a year, every single one of them was worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing some research about Sigma brushes, watching makeup tutorials in youtube and have found out most of the makeup artists uses Sigma brushes.  Right then i decided to purchased my own sigma and unexpectedly It was delivered to me very fast. I couldn&#x27;t say anything but WOW when i finally have it! i Super like my new Sigma brushes and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> the product is so soft and really good ! high recommendation ! I also just ordered two others brushes on sigma website . they are F80 and F82. I love those because some of my friends already used it and recommend them for me. they are so soft and excellent condition that I could not find anywhere else. can not waiting for two others coming ...love love love brushes. From now i can use these brushes everyday ....</li>
    <li> The SIgma Essential Kit is amazing! THe brushes are great quality, don&#x27;t shed,and to me are even better than brushes like MAC.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes like the F50 and F30 are amazing for face! The E55 and the E30 are my new favorite eye brushes! I definently suggest this kit and will repurchase these brushes if they ever break! Which they probably wont, because they are pretty sturdy!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes applying makeup so much easier and the brushes are easy to maintain. Will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing! i would recomend this to anyone who wants high quaality makeup brushes. they ship fast and are sooooo soft!and are a great fit for anyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes about 2 months ago and for such a lump sum of money i was hoping they&#x27;d live up to their name. They do! I have found many different application methods for pretty much every brush. All the brushes come nicely packaged and are super soft. Even after many washes they remain still nice and soft and surprisingly plump, the brushes don&#x27;t lose their shape. My favorite brush is the Duo Fiber brush i use this along with the foundation brush to do my face makeup and it picks up excess makeup off of my face while creating a smooth flawless finish. If you&#x27;re looking for long term value I&#x27;d say go with these brushes, they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
    <li> I just got mine yesterday and tried it today, it was great. The brushes are super soft, there was shedding. My  liquid foundation looked great using the duo brush. It apply very evenly.</li>
    <li> Best investment i ever made delivery and packaging was awesome product is perfect blends and washes well Thanks</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! The ESSENTIAL KIT has such a good value, and the quality of the brushes is really nice, too. I am just getting into cosmetics and make, and I thought these brushes would be perfect. This kit is great if your a beginner like me or a professional. The four face brushes come with protectors, which is nice, but the eye brushes don&#x27;t, and I kind of wish they did. Also, there is no case which means you have to buy one on your own. But doesn&#x27;t it make sense for brushes to come with a case? My favorite brushes are all of the face brushes because I use them for my make up every day.&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my face and apply moisturizer, I use the...&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush for primer&lt;br /&gt;The Duo Fibre brush for tinted moisturizer (btw I was super excited about the df brush because i couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere else!)&lt;br /&gt;The Powder/Blush brush for my loose powder&lt;br /&gt;The Large Angled Contour for highlighter on my cheekbones&lt;br /&gt;The Medium Angled Shading for highlighter on my brow bone&lt;br /&gt;and the Pencil brush for highlighter on my tear duct (not actually IN my eye)&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the E40 TAPERED BLENDING and the E60 LARGE SHADER&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THESE BRUSHES....YOU SHOULD BUY THEM!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> As most people know, having the right tools is important to any project. The same goes for make up. When wanting to achieve a flawless make up look it is essential to use quality brushes. Sigma Brushes are not only top quality, but incredibly affordable. They don&#x27;t shed, the keep their shape, and they pick up product unbelievably. This set has every brush I could never need for my day to day look and then some. I know that these brushes will be with me for years to come and I recommend this set to any beginning make up user.</li>
    <li> The product is simply amazing, certainly point out to other people to use these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I have similar products, but other brands, but not the final compartment of my makeup brushes with the Sigma.</li>
    <li> Good brushes with a reasonable price! The shipping was very fast also. I just thought it would came with the cup holder... Now I will have to buy it...</li>
    <li> I purchased this set directly from Sigma Beauty&#x27;s website earlier this year (January or February 2012) and decided to use it for a bit of time to really test the quality of these brushes.  I figured by this point, it had been used and washed a bunch of times and in the end, we all like to see how these products hold up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon initially receiving the brushes, the first thing I did was wash them.  In the first wash, I noticed that the large powder brush was the only one that had noticeable shedding (maybe 4-5 strands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duo-fiber brush I received wasn&#x27;t as dense in comparison to some other YouTube reviewers, and the large powder brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as I expected it to be.  Some YouTube video reviewers said that their large powder brush was extremely soft, but mine seemed to be very average, and at times a little prickly.  The large shader brush in my set had weird bristles, as if production of this brush was flawed because the cut for the brush shape at the top wasn&#x27;t so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small angle brush is the one I use the most, for gel eyeliners.  The brush itself is great, and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding issues.  Other brushes I enjoyed in this set were the large angled contour and eye shading brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bunch of washings, the large powder brush, eye shading, and large angled contour are the ones that seem to shed the most, but not with each wash.  For example, my large angled contour might shed 4-5 strands every 2-3 washes while my large powder brush sheds just 1 strand with each wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set is great for beginners who are looking for an affordable first set.  However, I do agree with some other reviews that the quality in the entire set isn&#x27;t consistent.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes !!! I heard great things about these brushes and was so excited to purchase them. They arrived quickly and nicely packaged. I have had many brushes .. Chanel, Nars, Lancôme, EcoTools, Dior, and some other brands. I really have tried many kinds and had individual brushes, but no sets except Lancôme and EcoTools! Those were great, but these are more professional and very well made. They are bigger and denser than any brushes I have used. I truly believe these are quality brushes. They apply makeup evenly and take the right amount of product!  $89 for 12 brushes is a great deal! There are individual brushes which cost up to $50 each and are comparable to these, if not of lesser quality. I love makeup and I am looking forward to using Sigma brushes for a long time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit \\&quot;the Essentials kit\\&quot; about a month ago and was completely hesitant to do so to start with, I had heard about them on YouTube and all the \\&quot;beauty gurus\\&quot;on YouTube raved about them.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t value the opinion of a bunch of teens.... So I did some research and after going back and forth for a few months I finally decided to purchase them.  I mean what did I have to lose but $90 dollars... I was pleasantly surprised when I received them a few days later.  I cleaned the brushes and was a bit concerned when the E40 blending brush and the F50 duo fibre bleed for a good while, I decided to let them dry and rewash them and they still bleed I think they jjust recently stopped (I wash all my brushes once a week). Other then that I really like them I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long, I like the quality and loooove the price.  The fact that I can compare these brushes to my MAC brushes in quality and get these at such and I mean such and affordable price I will definitely continue to purchase sigma brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of sigma brushes and I really love it. My favorite brush is the duo fibre, it makes it easier for me to apply my foundation and it gives me a even coat.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! I have been wanting these brushes for over 3 years now but have always been hesitent because of the price but these brushes are totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I purchased them as a gift to myself.  I did a lot of research on brushes before buying and for 12 these seem reasonably priced.  They are super soft though I took their recommendation of washing the brushes before using, they have a factory smell on them when they arrive.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. There are a lot of different choices to choose from in this kit. I think its good for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of brushes and who is looking to start a budget friendly good quality collection. The brushes are good sizes and have soft bristles. The Large powder brush sheds more then a MAC one would but that is my only complaint as of yet.  I have really enjoyed using them and would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set with gift cards I received for my birthday a month ago. I always heard about Sigma brushes online and had been wanting to get a set for some time now. Since I had gift cards for Amazon, I figured now was the best time to splurge!  The brushes came so fast and were wrapped up beautifully when I got them. I was sooo happy just looking at them. However, when I washed them the first time with baby shampoo (like I wash all of my other, cheaper brushes) many of them had significant shedding issues. I used a couple of the ones that had shed and there were actually hairs left on my face from the brush! I have never had that happen, and I&#x27;ve always used much cheaper (in price) makeup brushes.  I emailed customer support at Sigma and told them about my issue, and about a week later a box came in the mail with the 4 brushes I had mentioned that shed -- brand new! They didn&#x27;t even ask me to send the others back, which I was so impressed by.  Overall, I do like the brushes, but I don&#x27;t use them all every day. Some of my other brushes from cheaper brands still work better for me, but I do like the variety of this set. I am honestly so impressed with the customer service at Sigma, that I would probably order from them again in the future because I know they will take care of me.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes super quick! And love the quality!! I will diffently order again. I was very impressed with everything!! Thx</li>
    <li> I bought this to expand my brush set at a much lower cost than it would have cost me at MAC. I have 5 MAC brushes and I love them but their cost is ridiculous so I decided to try Sigma brushes after reading reviews. These brushes are pretty comparable to MAC, cost much less and work for me. I washed all the brushes before using and didn&#x27;t notices a lot of loose hairs falling out. The brushes are definitely soft and not scratchy on your face. If anyone wants to start a brush collection, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Great product, very happy.  I assumed it was supposed to come with a brush roll, however this was missing!   Otherwise very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They&#x27;re really soft and pick up product very well. They were a bit pricey, but worth it. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes quickly and I love them! They are so soft and very well made. The blending brushes work amazingly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this set!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and feel great when applying makeup.  The price is reasonable, since the brushes are such a good quality.  The shipping was fast (I got them in about a week).  I am super happy with the product and the company.  I have already picked out a few more brushes that I will be purchasing next!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing these brushes for quite some time now, because I have recently gotten into makeup and I wanted some nice brushes to accompany my new found love. They definitely meet my expectations! I did notice a tiny bit of shedding on a couple of the brushes but nothing else. The package came earlier than I expected too! Thank you Sigma!!</li>
    <li> Luv Luv Luv these brushes.  My purchase arrived in a timely manner and expertly packed.  I could not be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> When I first got the brushes they had good packaging, when I opened them and unwrapped them so of the hairs came off but that was fine. They are very soft and very good quality, they have a nice big handle and are easy to use. The application of the brushes were very nice and left a nice airbrush finish. Most of the brushes are identical to the MAC brushes. I would reccommend these to anyone who needs a beginner brush set.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting these brushes for the longest time and I finally decided to go ahead and spend the money on them. I was nervous that high end brushes wouldn&#x27;t make enough of a difference in the way my makeup looked to be worth the extra money, but I was wrong! These brushes improved the way my makeup applies and looks so much! My favorites are the F50, E40, and F70, but I use each and every brush and do not dislike a single one! If you love makeup and want to amp up your look, these are definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am blown away by the quality of these brushes.  They are so soft and really assist with even application of my make up.  I found with cheaper brushes my bronzer and blush would not go on well everytime.  I love my new brushes!</li>
    <li> I received my brush set this morning. I was so excited! I took them to the bathroom to clean them and discovered my E65 brushes bristles were bent and curved and I couldn&#x27;t set them even after I washed it. I emailed sigma and they replied within 25 minutes and are sending me a new one! So great. All the other brushes look fantastic and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> the pack was delivered to me in perfectly conditions. The brushes are amazing. I love it. the brand of this type of brushes is totally recommended. the quality of de brushes are exceptional. I recommend it for any girl that she want a perfect makeup.</li>
    <li> I now see what makeup applied with great quality brushes should look like!!! I am a forever customer! GREAT JOB</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic! There&#x27;s not one thing bad about them! They are so soft and work so well, i would recommend these brushes to anyone looking for a good quality brush set with a great variety of brushes!</li>
    <li> I just get my essential kit and i&#x27;m so loving it! It is great, just what I needed, you can see the difference applying the make up, the material is great, the brushes are so soft. I&#x27;m looking to get more Sigma&#x27;s brushes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush set, it has literally all the brushes you could possibly need (if you&#x27;re just using it for personal purposes). The brushes are super soft, great quality and large. They are sturdy and have a great polished look. They work great, capture a lot of product and are super precise in application. Totally recommend if you are looking for a complete set of brushes and don&#x27;t want to fuss with buying individual brushes. Set includes eye and face brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived in a timely manner and were what I expected. I tried them with my coastal scents eyeshadow 88 and they work great. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> although i&#x27;m a big beauty product fanatic, i thought more about purchasing the right products vs. brushes.  however, after watching countless youtube tutorials and following professional makeup artists, i decided to take the plunge and buy the sigma beauty essential kit.  first, i wish they included the brushes in more than a pink mesh bag but i guess for less than $100 and a dozen brushes, that may be a bit too much to ask.  regarding the actual brushes themselves, i was most excited to use the two-toned foundation brush - the kind you stiple on your face.  the first few times i used it, there was a significant amount of hair that fell out.  however, after the few times, it hasn&#x27;t.  regarding the other brushes, i think they&#x27;re solid.  i just got them over this holiday season so i need to try it out more but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I was so ecstatic when this set came in the mail! The quality matched up to some of the high-end brushes i&#x27;ve purchased in the past! However, I did notice some loose hair in the packaging which may be shedding upon being shipped? Yet after inspecting the brushes, they seemed perfect.</li>
    <li> When I opened my brushes and felt them I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft they are.I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I have heard and seen a lot of great things about these brushes so I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for my wife. This is what she had to say about them:  \\&quot;My new Sigma brushes are so awesome. I love how the eyeliner brush is so precise and applies powder eyeliner flawlessly. I highly recommend these brushes for makeup pros and newbies (like me)!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I got my sigma beauty essential kit yesterday, OMG I am in love with these brushes. I just wish I would have found out about this product way before because I have spent a lot a money on MAC. But, I am happy I got this product. The brushes works very nicely. I have applied eye make up with these brushes and it does wonder to my eyes unlike other cheap eye brushes. I would buy again and will definitely recommend this to my friends. Thanks Sigma for making these awesome brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to bring to my niece who leaves is Brazil, she is so excieted I found it for a great price. This is one of the most wanted products in Brazil among beauty professional.</li>
    <li> I bought this brushes as a birthday gift.  My daughter was very excited when she got them, she says that brushes looks nice, good quality, and very soft on skin. She just love it!!</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are absolutely amazing. I think they are the softest brushes I have ever used. I suggest though that you spend alittle more to buy the brushes with the case. I really wish I would have. Otherwise I love these.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a set of Sigma brushes for a couple of years now. All the youtube beauty gurus love them (makeupbytiffanyd and beautybroadcast). I finally had the available money to purchase this set. It makes makeup application a breeze. My face looks flawless and I am able to accomplish the makeup looks from the tutorials from the gurus, as they suggest specific brushes for each technique. Thank you Sigma I thought I was the problem, but it was my poor quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I have always been into makeup but lately I have been watching the mass amounts of eye shadow tutorials on youtube.  The videos always have girls mentioning all the Mac brushes that they are using for lid, crease, or highlight.... etc  I really didnt want to spend the $30 a brush price but I also wanted brushes that would give me that professional look and last.  So happy with my purchase!  Now just need a little holder for all my awesome tools!</li>
    <li> I couldnt wait to get these brushes due to how many reviews I had seen online and youtube!!!  I have been a professional makeup artist for 8 years and have and tried many diffrent kind of brushes!!!  The quality is outstanding and the shippment was so fast..  I will def. be shopping more..</li>
    <li> I was searching a birthday gift for her. so i decided to buy this. and she love it. the shipping was on time. everything about buy experience was Excellent . The package was in excellent condition. includes a tutorial on how to use them for the first time, how to clean, and wash them.</li>
    <li> UPDATE revised review: I am a hair and makeup artist and have used these brushes for the past 4 months. They have held up since the day they arrived. A little shedding but in honesty I love them. I have cleaned them multiple times and enjoy the larger handles. I do recommend them to my clients. I am still happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old review:: WORTH THE MONEY!  They are so soft and great! I have bought several make up brushes on Amazon to try out and these by far are the best and rank up there with the quality of MAC brushes. The handle on the brushes are thicker than the average makeup brush and I have to say it is way easier to hold. Again worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I waited a little while to give a review, after I received these brushes to try them out. So far I use them everyday! I am absolutely in love with these brushes!! They are extremely soft and very sturdy! The handles are solid and thats what I really like about them. They do not feel cheap or poorly made. and there are so many in this package. It comes with a very handy paper that tells exactly what each brush is used for!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> I really love Sigma Beauty Essential Kit because it contains 12 professional quality brushes for the face and eyes. Buy it now:-)</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this brushes! They are every woman&#x27;s dream. I also found very useful the pamphlet that came along with them, explaining the usage for each brush.</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes from Sigma Beauty. The quality of the product  certainly makes the difference in the result of makeup. I recommend this wonderful set of brushes for anyone who loves a beautiful production.</li>
    <li> I bought the brush set because of so many good reviews. But I&#x27;m really not impressed with the quality. I guess maybe I have a bad batch. The bristles are not soft and shedding is crazy even after a month. I have a lot of brushes from high end to low end. Even some of my cheaper brushs are softer and shed less. I do like the eyeliner brush though. For that one i gave a three star.</li>
    <li> I was using elf brushes and a travel set of Sonja Kashuk brushes.  I wanted to get a nice set, and after much research on youtube and amazon, I found these.  I absolutely love them!  They are so soft and give my overall makeup a nice appearance.  It is so easy to blend eye shadow and apply liners.  I definitely love this brand!</li>
    <li> I have always just bought cheap drugstore brushes and had never even considered buying a set of professional brushes. As an early Christmas present my husband bought me this set. I was thoroughly impressed with the softness and durability of the brushes and the difference in application of my makeup was 100x better! Highly recommended, as i will not go back to my cheap brushes ever again!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes sooo much!! They are all so useful, I use them every day. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without these brushes.</li>
    <li> Adorei o produto!!! Ele é lindo e chegou no prazo. Super recomendo!!! Valeu muito a pena! Os produtos Sigma são os melhores!!!</li>
    <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
    <li> This set has everything I need in it - the brushes are quality made and they make application of my make up easy!</li>
    <li> What a great brush collection all in one bundle &amp; a great price! They are fantastic &amp; work really well for applying make up.</li>
    <li> :look like a great product and can&#x27;t wait to start using it! shipping was right on time with no delay! happy with the service!</li>
    <li> Bought for pro cosmetologist daughter because I wanted quality without a MAC price.  I reviewed almost every brand and finally went with Sigma.  So glad I did!  We would say these are as good or even better than MAC.  Had to take several MACs back for bristles falling out.  Not an issue on these.  Great quality, no odors, no loose bristles, very soft, such a better price! ...will not go back to MAC.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes about 2 weeks ago, before heading off on a trip to California. And just in good time too! I washed them as soon I opened them from the box. I was thanking God that none of them were broken, or messed up. Each brush was in great condition. The big powder brush is fluffy, and is just a dream when working with MAC Skinfinish or any powder. The blush brush is great for obviously blushes, but also contouring. Now...one thing I had a problem with is the I think...large angled brush for the eyes..? Idk, but it&#x27;s angled, but quite long- so when I try to blend or contour my eyes, it just goes everywhere. (Exaggeration. But nevertheless bothersome.) It&#x27;s my only pet-peeve at the moment. The only useful eye brushes to me are the small angled brush, and the skinny brush mainly used for eyeliner or concealer. So yeah. Great buy! Love them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell you about the quality as I bought these for a gift but I was sadly disappointed as this product did not come with the cilinder case/holder that was in one of the pictures!</li>
    <li> Very nice product... I been in the industry more than a decade and I try all kind of brands but this one is one of the best...</li>
    <li> These are excellent quality, very well packaged &amp; presented.  I also bought the Sigma Brush Case &amp; presented both items as a Gift to my 24yr old daughter ....... She absolutely loves applying make-up &amp; was totally delighted with this very professional looking Brush set &amp; case. All delivered on time by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this set of brushes for the first time. A friend of mine has been using them for a while and always said good things about it, so I thought I would try. I cannot say enough good things aboout it. I simply love it.From now on, I&#x27;ll only buy sigma brushes. Great value for the product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these brushes.  I also have a travel set and have given them as gifts.  No shedding at all.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  First, they are very high quality -- soft and provide a smooth application.  Second, they are labeled -- so a non-make-up artist like me knows which brush is for what.  Finally, this is a very complete set -- it has foundation, concealer, powder, blush, and tons of eye shader brushes.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t have that I use is an eyebrow brush.  I would highly recommend this set - worth the money if you take care of them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the new Sigma Brushes. They are so soft on my skin and for the price and the amount of brushes that came with the kit, I am very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely happy with my new Sigma brushes!!! I received what I payed for :) :) I think it is a steal. The quality is descent. The only thing I did not like was that they did not include a brow or lip brush. Besides that they include all your essential brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are definitely nothing special. They don&#x27;t feel exceptionally soft or special in any way. I have probably used them a total of 4 or 5 times since purchasing them and today when I picked up the big powder brush, the handle fell OFF!!! What a joke. Do not buy these.</li>
    <li> This set is exactly what I expected it to be. The brushes are great quality and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding.</li>
    <li> Shipment: These arrived super fast. I am quite impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impression: Really nice packaging. all the brushes are nice secured in their own durable plastic flap. Also, I can tell the brushes are really new because the smell. I can still smell the glue used to make them which is a PLUS. I do not want a brush that has been collecting dust for ages before shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: The brushes are amazingly soft and full/dense. If you have ever used sigma brushes, you know that they are the best for the price. These are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I received these brushes super fast. There was a very strong shallac like order emanating from them so I just set them by an open window for a day or two in my bathroom and the odor has gone down considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got around to using them during my routine make up application ... and they performed so well. The F20 brush is by far my favorite! It is firm and textured enough to hold the foundation powder yet soft enough so it goes over very well in the powder and doesn&#x27;t make a crumbly mess of it ....like my other synthetic brush (whom shall not be named...but you know who you are). A very even and smooth foundation application was the end result and could not be happier. It is definitely worth the price; which is decent enough when compared to other brushes in this class size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E50 brush is my favorite of the eye brushes. Again because it has the duality I am looking for in a good eye brush ...firm enough to pack color on yet soft and agile enough for light blending jobs. Those are the most noticeable features I wanted to point out about the brushes. The only two qualms I have with the brushes is the thin bristol packing of the stippling or F50 brush I think if it had a firm packing of the bristles it could be superb for liquid foundation application and blending again pulling a double duty job and as stated before the shallac odor that comes with the packaged brushes (but easily remedied through and air out process) but for the price such a process should not have to be done!</li>
    <li> They feel great on the face and apply product with ease and are so soft.  I will be collecting many more brushes.  My favorite are the eye brushes and the Kabuki&#x27;s.  The large blender sheds a lot , though.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, these are a little overpriced on Amazon and if you are going to buy any Sigma brush or brush set, buy it from the Sigma website becuase they are cheaper there. I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, these brushes are awesome! Anyone that says they aren&#x27;t worth the money is way too picky. There are VERY comparible to MAC brushes in quality... basically the same. I bought this set from the Sigma website probably about 3 years ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them. I still use them every single day and have wanted to order a second set since! I will be purchasing a travel set from them though for easier use on the go. Wash them all before you use them to get rid of the little initial shedding, I use baby shampoo and just let them dry over night. I still absolutley LOVE these brushed but my only complaint is with the the F50 Duo Fibre brush ... not too long after I got it the metal part starting detaching a little bit from the handle so I will eventually have to purchase another one. I still use it everyday though. Otherwise, I use every brush in this set except the F60 Foundation brush only because I prefer a different brush for foundation (Sephora Pro Airbrush #55) I loved that so much, I bought 2. I recommend using that for foundation.</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter after much begging, she absolutely loves them. I would recommend this set of brushes they are great</li>
    <li> i expect better form it, the price is little high for make up brushes&lt;br /&gt;i hope i get better  experience with it</li>
    <li> All I wanted was a good set of brushes without spending hundreds of dollars at MAC or Sephora. I&#x27;m no make-up artist, but I do know the difference between quality brushes and the cheap versions that usually come in sets. So, I was a little wary ordering these online, but with all the great reviews I went ahead and bought the essentials kit and the faux leather roll you can get on Sigma&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are truly amazing. I am still in awe of what a steal they are for a mere hundred bucks. They have long handles and look like a professional artist&#x27;s tools. They have a good density and are very soft. There are enough eyeshadow brushes to play around with a variety of looks. This truly is an essentials kit for anyone who wears make-up.</li>
    <li> Overall, the quality of these brushes is quite excellent. The bristles are soft, the design is nice. Beside that, I have some complaints about these brushes as well. When I first cleanse it, a lot of bristles from the duo fibre, larger shader, and the powder brush fell out. According to the brush guide, it suggests me to spot cleanse it before the first use, but I deep cleansed it instead just because I prefer deep clean rather than spot clean. I&#x27;m pretty sure I did everything correctly. I have read the brush guide, and watched several videos on how to wash your makeup brushes from Michelle Phan, Blair Fowler, Kandee Johnson, etc. I even bought the brush guards to properly protect and store these brushes. However, the duo fibre, larger shader, and the powder brush keep shedding bristles crazily. Also, after the first clean, the foundation brush seems to loss its softness. The bristles feel completely different than the first time I feel it when I first got the kit. Whenever I use it to apply my foundation, it tends to poke my skin, and my skin gets a little bit irritated from that. Also after the first clean, the tapered blending brush kinda lost its original shape/form. The tip of the bristles used to be fluffy and spread out at the end, but now the bristles are kinda closed inward, which makes the brush lost its original shape/form. Despite those three problems above, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip on cleaning brushes: the duo fibre and the tapered blending are the hardest one to cleanse in my opinion. Make sure to spend extra time on cleansing these two because you might leave some residue on them without notices.</li>
    <li> Im an MUA and I LOVE THESE BRUSHES! Don&#x27;t waste your money on MAC brushes. They are over rated! My husband got these for me as he saw some of my brushes were cracked and old (and cheap to be honest). He surprised me with these and i absolutely love them! The bristles are so noticeably soft. The shadow brushes pick up the shadow so nicely  and are easy to clean, great quality! Just missing the kabuki brush! i love showing them off to my clients and am recommending them left and right! MUA must have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many different brands and types of makeup brushes. I&#x27;ve owned natural fibers as well as acrylics. I&#x27;ve purchased cheap brushes that are coarse and terrible as well as expensive ones that are soft and amazing. These brushes are very soft and for what you pay for they&#x27;re pretty good, I must say. The bag is also nice. With all my makeup brushes I clean/wash them after use. Always with liquid makeup and every couple of days with dry. Some of the hairs DO come out, when washing. Over all still OK.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I HATE about these brushes is the dye that comes out of the black brushes. I&#x27;ve easily washed/soaked this brush in soap/water, white vinegar, rubbing alcohol maybe 50 times and to this day the black dye STILL flows out of the brush. This is extremely annoying when I wash a brush and the black dye comes out on your face. I clean my makeup brushes frequently to avoid putting bacteria and gunk back on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Since I find the black dye so annoying I never use the two of the Sigma brushes anymore. (F30 and F50)&lt;br /&gt;Sigma, PLEASE stick with natural hairs. I don&#x27;t care what color the brush is. When I dry the brush it stains my towels!</li>
    <li> the best brushes with the best price</li>
    <li> I think this set is fake,  the handles are lighter than the set I ordered off of sigma. Com. the stipple brush is garbage.  The brushes shed some. These brushes are priced too high.  I waited a long time some years for this set,  and I couldn&#x27;t order off of sigma. Com tried for 3 days,  there site kept crashing not showing images like it had a virus in it,  so I didn&#x27;t order from them,  had to order from Amazon.  I regret it now,  cause I really believe these brushes are fake !!!! I&#x27;m so upset at sigma. Com,  because on the site they list other retailers to get there products from,  they are scamming us !! And we don&#x27;t get a free brush when u order from Amazon,  which sucks, how much we pay for this low quality set,  the prices should be lowered  ASAP ! Waited all the years for this set for nothing !! I want my $$$ back !!</li>
    <li> They are wonderful and so soft. And my makeup looks better than ever with these brushes! I&#x27;ve used so many different \\&quot;designer\\&quot; brushes but these are my all time favorite!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter, a budding makeup artist. She LOVES them.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item! the brushes are well made and are so soft! These are a great dupe for Mac brushes if not better and I absolutely love and recomend them!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my birthday and I can say after having them and using them for close to a year they are TERRIBLE! They shed like crazy and eventually just fell apart completely. Very disappointed in the sigma line and will never buy them again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting great quality brushes for some time now and after doing my research this definitely seemed to be the best bang for your buck!!! The brushes are so soft and comes with a great guide to teach you what each one is best used for, which is so helpful when applying your makeup..&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the shipping was super FAST!</li>
    <li> The brushes are good, and easy to clean. There&#x27;s yet no problem with them, and I have had them for 3 weeks or so now.</li>
    <li> The small brushes are good, the big ones the end is loose and hairs falling out with first use.  I would buy more of the smaller brushes again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and she says it&#x27;s as good as the expensive brands</li>
    <li> good bang for your buck</li>
    <li> Good like them for the money</li>
    <li> A great set of brushes!! Just keep them clean and enjoy</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I love them. They are high quality brushes and they are original Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> i order these brushes cuz i heard that they were the best and they delivered quickly !!! i thought the only way to know the truth is by ordering it !!! and now i know its the truth these brushes are the BEST !!!! and i recommend every body to use it !!</li>
    <li> I am a complete makeup novice, but I love these brushes. There&#x27;s a brush for every need and the best part is that they do not shed at all! The absolutely only complaint I had is that this set does not come with a brush roll. My mistake for not reading the details closely enough, but do not expect to receive a bag for the brushes like I did.</li>
    <li> These brushes work amazing!!! They work just as great as MAC brushes if not better and are cheaper as well!! I&#x27;m very satisfied and pleased, they are amazing!!</li>
    <li> I am very very disappointed. I watched about a million videos on you tube and read about 500 reviews about how amazing these are. For the price point, I was expecting mac quality....nowhere near. These compare to elf brushes, not even the pro ones but the cheap 1$ ones. I spent so much money for absolutely no reason. Go buy mac. This is all a mass marketing/advertising ploy</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and the brushes are as soft as when I first opened them from their packaging. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Brushes are really expensive individually, so for the price for this set isn&#x27;t so bad. I was dying to get these and my boyfriend surprised me with them for my birthday last year (so sweet!) I never read many reviews about them but I just know that I needed them. The quality of them is ok, I wish I could love them 100% but after a year now I can tell you that some brushes are great while others are not. A few of them shed a lot, especially the face brushes (since they&#x27;re bigger, I guess) I don&#x27;t wash them too much, I take care of them, I&#x27;m not rough with them or anything so it can be a bit annoying. When I use the stippling brush especially, it sheds a lot and its mind boggling because the black hairs reach to the top so quick and I have to keep picking them off my face. Overall, they&#x27;re a great set of brushes, for the price you pay they&#x27;e awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also the brush holder that it comes with? Dear God, don&#x27;t touch them while there&#x27;s makeup on your fingers! I sometimes think I have OCD but it REALLY bugs me that I cant get rid of the finger marks on them, I&#x27;ve tried everything! Its just good for when you travel because the face brushes end up being all squished together, then again I hate it when my brushes touch each other.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush set when you are ready to graduate from basic cheaper sets like Elf and Ecotools, both of which are wonderful and I actually still use, especially ecotools (their concealer and angled eyeliner brush are part of my daily routine still).  I don&#x27;t use every single brush in the collection but I love that I have them. My faves are the eyeshadow blending brush (never knew what I was missing), the large powder, angled eyeliner and the eyeshadow brush picks up product wonderfully.</li>
    <li> amazing and makes the makeup easy to apply</li>
    <li> First set of brushes and i love them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft, handles are of nice quality, overall great set of starter brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brushes! I recommend Sigma products! It also arrived very fast and I have orded this item from Canada.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes in a matter of days and was excited to use them since I&#x27;ve heard great reviews. There&#x27;s no shedding and the handles were substantial. I can immediately tell they were quality brushes. The brushes make such a difference in how the make up is applied. I think this set was worth the money but it is pricey. I would take out an eye brush and add a contouring brush in addition to the blush brush. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> these brushes are absolutely wonderful money well spent. I love how soft and well these brushes work they really distribute the product well</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! they are super soft and work so well with different products! The price was good too for how many they give you! LOVE LOVE LOVE . I really wanna get the MRS BUNNY collection ! Would recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> I just bought these and they do shed a bit but thats ok. For the price and what they do I love these brushes. I even got a gift (extra brush) with my order. Love these so glad I bought them</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! they&#x27;re the best</li>
    <li> the stigma kit is great , you have the essential brushes that you need for great makeup and they are soft, and have great quality. :)</li>
    <li> I very loved the product !!!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are wonderful, simply incomparable !!!&lt;br /&gt;Are soft and effective and good for any kind make up!</li>
