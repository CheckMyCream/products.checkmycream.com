    <li> Great taste, does a good job with no additives</li>
    <li> I didnt like it at first, but now its the only brand of toothpaste I ever buy for about 10 years now</li>
    <li> Fluoride-free, real spearmint flavoring, no artificial sweeteners and it makes our teeth feel and look clean. Highly recommended, though it may take a bit of time to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has become our family favorite, but our kids gradually accepted it.

As they read more about the harmful nature of the sweeteners and fluoride, they began to really appreciate Tom&#x27;s products and now this is one of the few brands we use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste works well for our daily use, and it freshens breath while cleaning. Its consistency is not as firm as others, and the real mint taste may not linger as long as some of the chemically-induced flavoring that other products have, but it is right for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a more natural toothpaste, we recommend Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite toothpaste, glad Amazon caries it!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I&#x27;m not a mint fan (though I love a good mojito!). I just don&#x27;t like that, &amp;#34;OMG is my mouth on fire that fake-mint taste is so overpowering&amp;#34; taste that comes with most toothpastes. This is a kinder, gentler mint flavor. I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste for over a decade - no cavities and healthy dental checkups (i.e., not a lot of scraping during cleanings). My only complaint about the toothpaste is...I want the cinnamon flavor they used to have but that&#x27;s not the toothpaste&#x27;s fault. As far as mint goes this is, by far, the best of the minty toothpastes - if you don&#x27;t like mint. ;)</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste without fluoride. Love the taste, not sweet. Makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> an excellent toothpaste</li>
    <li> Look If I had the time to make my own natural toothpaste I would! but this is good enough for now while I&#x27;m on the go. It taste minty and does the job as tooth paste does. Do I notice my teeth getting whiter ? No! but it does get my teeth clean and that&#x27;s really what I bought it for in the 1st place.</li>
    <li> Item as described. This is my favorite flavor of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste and it&#x27;s hard to find in the fluoride free variety.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste we use</li>
    <li> This is the only type of toothpaste my fianc&amp;eacute; will use. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. This was the best price we could find and he didn&#x27;t even know other flavors were available.</li>
    <li> I like Tom’s of Maine in general on account of their environmental awareness and no animal testing policy. I had found that their Antiplaque and Whitening toothpaste has a dehydrating effect and I usually had to drink or rinse with a lot of water after brushing my teeth to get rid of the chalkiness. However, now I’ve started using less toothpaste and also letting it hydrate/foam a little in my mouth for a minute or two before I do any serious brushing and that has helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several vigilant reviewers have pointed out that Tom’s (now owned by Colgate-Palmolive) add sodium lauryl sulfate (aka SLS or SDS) to their toothpaste. There’s no evidence that SLS causes cancer but it can be a skin irritant at higher concentrations and has been shown to exacerbate canker sores in sensitive people. SLS is not naturally occurring – it’s made from fatty acids such as those found in coconut oil. Tom’s says: “When used in our toothpaste, SLS has limited contact with the gums and is then rinsed out. At the levels used in our products, SLS has no known toxicity — not even when ingested.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the fluoride front, the addition to fluoride to water (practiced in the US but not in most European countries) helps to reduce dental decay but also carries some risks. I think we (involuntarily) get enough fluoride in our water – supplementing this with the even more fluoride in toothpaste is unnecessary in my view, considering that there are several concerns regarding its use. Quick summary of fluoride dosage and toxicity: around 5 grams is a potentially lethal dose for an adult and 60 mg for an average 2 year old. If a child were to accidentally swallow less than half a tube of toothpaste (such as Colgate Kids), it could be fatal. Then, around 0.2 mg/kg body weight can cause gastrointestinal discomfort (i.e. 2.4 mg for a 12 kg 2 year old, or 12 mg for a 60 kg adult). A large strip of toothpaste contains around 2.25 mg of fluoride (and a truly pea-sized amount contains 0.3 mg) while a liter of municipal tap water usually contains 1 mg. So, the amount of fluoride in toothpaste is fairly significant if you use a lot of paste, brush your teeth often, and/or tend to swallow some of it. In addition to gastrointestinal discomfort, chronic exposure to fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation. I’d rather eliminate the fluoride source in my toothpaste even if I choose to live with the fluoride in my tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sustainability: 100% of Tom’s energy usage is offset by wind energy credits. They also do a lot of internal recycling, use post-consumer cardboard for packaging and waste or vegetable-based inks for printing. The “goodness report” on their website expansively covers their goals for energy and water use, recycling and waste generation, ingredients and community impact. It also mentions their planned move away from using SDS. Terracycle offer recycling of toothpaste tubes (along with many other items such as deodorant, floss, mouthwash and toothbrushes) for people willing to collect several of them and ship them off. This recycling program is sponsored by Tom’s but actually you can recycle empty containers from any company. It’s worth checking out Terracycle for recycling packaging in general - they provide free shipping labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other popular options in the category of natural toothpaste (cruelty-free, generally natural ingredients, and fluoride-free options available) are Nature’s Gate and Jason’s. I like both companies and have used Nature’s Gate toothpaste for a long time. Nature’s Gate provides more information on sustainability than do Jason’s. Although Tom’s does a good job on the environmental front, I’m thinking of switching back to Nature’s Gate (also a great company), mainly because of the chalkiness / dryness I feel after using Tom’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I’ll give the Tom’s of Maine Antiplaque and Whitening toothpaste 4/5 goldstars for quality of the product and 5/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. If they changed their formulation by removing the SDS and made it less chalky then it might get 5 gold stars.stars for quality of the product and 5/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it.

    <li> I like this toothpaste and have used Toms products for many years.  Now I am becoming more aware of unwanted chemicals in products. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is one of them.  Therefore will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> 1 of my favorite fluoride free toothpastes to date, works good for me !</li>
    <li> No &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; about this. I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s natural, but my hubby and I both feel like we need gum after use lol We have been using this plus Honest Co mouthwash. The consistency is more runny than normal toothpaste. It&#x27;s definitely a big difference but we are going to use the two tubes we bought and then reevaluate.</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural product great price</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste my husband uses, primarily because it is comprised of all natural ingredients. It has been his choice of toothpastes for over a decade now so I think that probably says it all.</li>
    <li> Incredibly good and natural. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> MY favorite healthy toothpaste :)</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected.  No flouride, great taste (though you shouldn&#x27;t eat it :-))</li>
    <li> My husband likes this. I am trying to switch all of our synthetic ingredient goods for better for you stuff like this&lt;br /&gt;and he likes this one. He liked the cinnamon one but really likes this one much better.  Not sure about how it&lt;br /&gt;whitens yet because he has only used it one week. I will update if we notice a big difference. I still give it 5&lt;br /&gt;starts because he was wanting to go back to the synthetic bad for you stuff and since I found this one he&lt;br /&gt;is not complaining.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite toothpastes</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve learned about the dangers of fluoride and no longer buy or use fluoride toothpaste. Find out more online at the Fluoride Action Network (www.fluoridealert.org) and/or on some excellent books on the dangers of fluoride in Amazon&#x27;s books section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is fluoride yet another attempt by our gov&#x27;t to keep US citizens sick and stupid?</li>
    <li> If they would just loose the glycerine it would be perfect</li>
    <li> Working well for me. Best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the spearmint Tom&#x27;s without the dreaded fluoride in the local&lt;br /&gt;drug store so although I didn&#x27;t save a lot on the price and it took rather long&lt;br /&gt;(came from an outside Amazon source) it was worth it.  I just wish the makers&lt;br /&gt;hadn&#x27;t gone to the containers that make it hard to squeeze every last drop out.</li>
    <li> Taste takes a while to get used to have using Crest or Mentadent, but it doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach or have flouride in it which is so important</li>
</ol>
