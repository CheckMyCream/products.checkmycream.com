      <li>that despite being marketed for child use this probably wouldn&#x27;t be a very good toothbrush for a kid.  </li>

      <li>, be it DVD Recorders, Players, etc that haven&#x27;t worked great for a while and then die.  </li>
      <li>I bought mine in November 2009 for $26.99 - a great price.    </li>
      <li>I was so happy when this one came out.  </li>
      <li>with the Elite and be happy or buy these</li>
      <li>This is a great toothbrush for those looking for a travel version of the sonicare or a inexpensive way to get into sonicare brushing.</li>
      <li>This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been great at brushing throughout life.  </li>
      <li>, it works, it&#x27;s great for travel anywhere on earth without the need to lug charging paraphernalia along.</li>
      <li>because I gave two of them as gifts) are still working just great.  </li>
      <li>This works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product,</li>
      <li>you want to improve the waterproof quality of the o-ring greatly, lubricate it with silicone grease--the sort sold for the o-rings in underwater camera housings.</li>
      <li>I consider myself fairly intelligent and am a college graduate and didn&#x27;t know this; however I do have three waterproof electonic items that never have this issue.  </li>
      <li>Also without the vaseline, the rubber o-ring can twist as you put the cap on, as experienced with my tank.</li>
      <li>I bought the kids their Elites about one year ago and they are as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a plus is easier dentist visits, cleanings are easier and the hygienists always comment on how good my teeth look.</li>
      <li>Eventually, we  bought our kids some good quality Sonicares and they</li>
      <li>so I could give it a fair trial.</li>
      <li>Also, the O ring is rubber or looks like rubber and seems to make a good seal.  </li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>My strategy is to buy a good set of 4 rechargeable batteries and a charger for under $20.  </li>
      <li>A lot of electric toothbrushes offer superior cleaning to a manual toothbrush, though.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s just as good as the $150 dollar ones, and easier to store and keep charged.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years and never had a problem, it works great and is excellent for traveling as you don&#x27;t have to carry around a charger which doesn&#x27;t work in some countries even with the right adaptors.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to report that it&#x27;s working just as good as the day I bought it!  </li>
      <li>The best part about Sonicare is how clean your teeth feel and</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I have to say that I am pretty impressed with it for a battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>&quot; This has not happened to me, and I certainly don&#x27;t take the best of care to avoid getting water on it.</li>
      <li>And using my own AA battery is a plus.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t imagine that Philips put any kind of testing in to this product.  </li>
      <li>This model has all the power of the sealed rechargeable models in a nice package for travel (I have both).</li>
      <li>I would recommend going with an Oral-B or a more durable Sonicare.</li>
      <li>The trick is using good NiMH batteries--in this case, a pair of fresh La Crosse</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 of these and none of them lasted more than a month.</li>
      <li>You would be better off with one of the rechargeable models that have sealed handles.</li>
      <li>and I like this better.  </li>
      <li>I think this one allows more water into the top, but the battery compartment tighter - so inconsistent quality.  </li>
      <li>I love mine.</li>
      <li>$8) reciprocating brushes.  </li>
      <li>She also has a rechargable at her moms and elected to take the rechargeable to school as she likes it better.</li>
      <li>It should have been designed with a screw on top with the o-ring, like a flashlight, instead of a push on top.</li>
      <li>Too many reviews</li>
      <li>The greater the capacity of the battery, the longer the motor will be able to perform without any hiccups.</li>
      <li>Then take the battery cover off, remove the batteries, and make sure there&#x27;s no water there.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago now, I had gotten used to paying over $100 for a Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>Most are about water damage, and water going in the battery compartment.   </li>
      <li>Also, I added a silicone tape (from HomeDepot) to the top of the O-ring.</li>
      <li>I have had it for nine months now and love it.</li>
      <li>Yet consider this:  THAT costs three times more than THIS.  </li>
      <li>OK, perhaps sarcasm isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s called for here.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who has used an underwater camera case or gone diving already knows how to take care of water gaskets, but for the uninitiated:  Dry gaskets do not provide a perfect seal on *any* product.</li>
      <li>My teeth are better, my gums are better, and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier than when I was poking around in my mouth with the manually-operated Oral-B brushes my dentist gave away for free.    </li>
      <li>Not a lot of features, but it has the single best one, replaceable batteries.</li>
      <li>With alkaline or NiMh batteries, the run time is far superior to the Sonicare rechargeable units costing many times more.  </li>
      <li>agree that the bottom cap and o-ring are not exactly the best, but I have no problem with water coming in.</li>
      <li>I rectified this situation rather easily by just not standing the brush after use.  </li>
      <li>The unit is easy to use, the head is smallish</li>
      <li>Yes, I do take off the brush to clean the top bit every week or two</li>
      <li>Also, the performance seems to remain strong throughout the battery wear cycle.  </li>
      <li>This is to say, strong and thorough with no complaints at all.</li>
      <li>Five full crowns, and as many fillings as I have teeth.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s almost as good as new today</li>
      <li>I just recieved the brush in the mail yesterday and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>my batter compartment and contacts look fine.</li>
      <li>We also use rechargable NiMh batteries and they work fine.  </li>
      <li>About a year and a half ago I was shopping around for the best deal on a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>keep the bottom end dry, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>Buy the best or try for two;  Less than three duds wins!</li>
      <li>Had to pass on that, but with a unit available for 30 bucks, I&#x27;m in for a test.    </li>
      <li>For $26 and free shipping from Amazon, you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
      <li>and it is important to cut weight.  </li>
      <li>whether cheaper is better,  or price wins the day.    </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>Also AA batts are always available but 115 is not.  </li>
      <li>Why do I keep buying it; because when it works it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I have been fortunate with the use of this toothbrush and, touch wood, that will continue.</li>
      <li>and she liked it so much that she bought one for me too.</li>
      <li>If you look for brand name rechargeables that are rated for 2500 mAH or more, you have the right ones.  </li>
      <li>This will eventually degrade the gasket (lithium grease would be more appropriate), but it&#x27;s worked fine for more than a year on this last one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a regular plug in Sonicaire unit for four years and was excited to lose the cord, I&#x27;ve moved and the outlet in my new bathroom was not in the best place.  </li>
      <li>You have to use the original replacement heads by Philips.  </li>
      <li>I purchased an original Sonicare that lasted about one year, so I decided to try cheaper e3000 with replaceable batteries.  </li>
      <li>My conclusion is unless you take the thing into the bathtub and use it to play submarines and battleships (something I admittedly have not attempted), it will continue working despite significant exposure to moisture.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had to clean the battery compartment.    </li>
      <li>I much prefer the relatively light brushhead and battery performance has been phenomenal.</li>
      <li>Eventually, after a month or two, the battery contact will be so corroded that no amount of tapping will help and you have to go in with something abrasive (like sandpaper) to clean up the battery contact.  </li>
      <li>but still don&#x27;t get your teeth clean.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My Sonicare e3000 quit working about 3 weeks after I purchased it.  I thought it was the battery at first.  I installed new batteries, and they worked for about 1 week.  After that, it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  This toothbrush is waaayyy too expensive for only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> About a year and a half ago I was shopping around for the best deal on a Sonicare toothbrush.  This was (and still is) the cheapest Sonicare model available which I liked, yet there were a ton of negative reviews from frustrated users on Amazon which concerned me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading through the reviews I figured out that the #1 complaint from users was related to water getting inside of the toothbrush and wrecking havoc on the electronics there.  There were a couple other problems brought up, but the others appeared to be rare enough that as long as you could get past Philip&#x27;s poor job of waterproofing the case then this toothbrush had the potential to be a pretty good deal!  I decided that since I could buy two or three of this model of Sonicare for the price of a single higher-end model I&#x27;d take my chances and just buy another one if it didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this model twice a day for over a year now and I&#x27;m pleased to report that it&#x27;s working just as good as the day I bought it!  The key is to be careful how you use it when you&#x27;re brushing your teeth and how you set it down after.  When putting it under the faucet try to only run water over the top half.  I rinse off the bristles and its neck, but do not let any water run onto or over the base of the unit.  When I&#x27;m done I do NOT set the unit on its base (which would lead to water left on the head dripping down onto its base.  Instead I set it on its side.  I also avoid setting it in any puddles that may have formed around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny that despite being marketed for child use this probably wouldn&#x27;t be a very good toothbrush for a kid.  It requires special care and they may be less likely to \\&quot;baby\\&quot; it, but it could be perfectly suitable for an adult to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;3 years later (so 4+ years of total use) and it hasn&#x27;t died on me.  Still very satisfied with this toothbrush and as long as I remember to replace the heads somewhat regularly it seems to work as good as new!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Mine has been working for OVER FIVE YEARS without a problem.  In fact, from falling off the counter, it has had a crack in the handle for two years and it still works like the day I got it and now, I&#x27;m getting another one because the price keeps dropping!  If yours broke after three months because you flooded it repeatedly, you shouldn&#x27;t be complaining about the toothbrush; you should be complaining about your amazing ability to destroy something that is robustly made and takes very little care.   I had Sonicares for years and the one and only drawback that I had with them is that once the rechargeable batteries died, your Sonicare was dead too.  That was not an acceptable solution considering the price.  If you used it every day, twice a day, you&#x27;d get about a year and a half out of them.  When my last one died, I was so disappointed that I decided to go back to a manual brush and flossing routine.  However, my professional cleaning was so BRUTAL after only six months of using a manual toothbrush vs. them being a breeze when I had my Sonicare, I knew that I had to get another one.  I was so happy when this one came out.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about throwing my expensive Sonicare away when the rechargeable batteries died.  Better yet, this one wasn&#x27;t even expensive.  Many years ago now, I had gotten used to paying over $100 for a Sonicare.  $26?? Are you kidding me?  So it doesn&#x27;t have the Quadpacer and the other fancy reminders.  Big deal.  It still does the whole job.  I was a little hesitant to buy when I read some of the bad reviews caused by bad production or leakage.  The issue about the brush getting wet didn&#x27;t concern me.  You&#x27;re not supposed to get the bristles wet or else the toothpaste will foam in your mouth like crazy.  Those people who wet the bristles probably are ruining their Sonicare e3000s.  BUT in their defense, I poured over the instructions and they don&#x27;t say not to wet the bristles.  The old Sonicare instructions definitely instructed not to wet the bristles, just apply the toothpaste and brush your teeth, saliva being plenty enough moisture to do the job without making a huge foamy mess.  I haven&#x27;t wet my brush head in years and so my Sonicare doesn&#x27;t get soaked.  So maybe that&#x27;s one problem with why these are getting poor reviews from a significant number of people.  The other is that I bought a spare and then gave it to a friend as a gift.  They opened it and it did not work at all.  Luckily, it was still under warranty and I got a new one as a replacement which worked fine.  This is the only reason I might think that there could be some quality control issues--just because I got one that left the factory not working for whatever reason.  However, the three that I know of (because I gave two of them as gifts) are still working just great.  I&#x27;ve had mine, the same one, going strong FOR OVER FOUR YEARS now.    Seems like Philips is now realizing that the money is to be made selling the replacement heads, but, really, I only replace mine about once a year.  Changing these heads every three months is like changing your oil in your car every 500 miles.  It&#x27;s nice.  It won&#x27;t hurt the car.  But it&#x27;s totally unnecessary.  For $26 and free shipping from Amazon, you can&#x27;t beat it.  It sells at Target for the $40 price still.  $26?? Ridiculously inexpensive, particularly when you consider that it also comes with a nice pair of AA batteries that are worth at least $3.    For those who are swamping their e3000&#x27;s to death STOP WETTING THE BRISTLES!!!!  DON&#x27;T DO IT!!!!  Just put toothpaste on the dry bristles and start brushing just like Philips used to tell you to do in the instructions for the original Sonicare.  Also, I tried to use other brand replacement heads: don&#x27;t do it.  They suck.  They&#x27;re loud and they don&#x27;t vibrate as much.  You have to use the original replacement heads by Philips.  But the prices keep coming down.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Sonicare toothbrushes but have been disappointed that the rechargable NiCad batteries wear out so quickly, then I had to throw the whole thing away.  While looking for a new Sonicare for my 8-year-old I came across the e3000.  He has been using it twice a day for over a year now and no problem.  I had read of several problems with the toothbrush dying within months because of water getting in the battery compartment.  Someone suggested putting vaseline around the o-ring, which I did and it seemed to fix the seal.  My son is not careful with getting water on his toothbrush and I often find it sitting in a little pool of water on the sink.  Still, no problem.    We also use rechargable NiMh batteries and they work fine.  This brush is a little less powerful than the rechargable Sonicares, which is probably good for kids.  But when my current one dies, I definately plan on an e3000, unless Sonicare switches to NiMh batteries instead of NiCads.  I am currently buying a new one for my daughter, who is now old enough to use one.</li>
    <li> I have had my Sonicare for over 9 months.  I have to say that I am pretty impressed with it for a battery operated toothbrush.  Had one of the rechargable sonicares and I like this better.  I have one each for myself and two kids.  Two are still running fine after 9 months of use the third just died. (my daughter is away at school with it so I can&#x27;t say what caused the early demise.)  Needless to say she&#x27;ll be picking up another one.  She also has a rechargable at her moms and elected to take the rechargeable to school as she likes it better.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the brush in the mail yesterday and it works fine.  It really is very close to the big one.      The holes in the battery compartment mentioned in some of the other reviews are not there.  I think someone at the factory must have been reading your reviews.  Also, the O ring is rubber or looks like rubber and seems to make a good seal.  I think with a little care it should do the job just fine.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to immerse the unit in water anyway.    I need to travel a lot for work and it is important to cut weight.  This brush saves some weight and bulk in my carry on.  Also AA batts are always available but 115 is not.  I think it will do the job very well.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how other reviewers used this, but I had no problem after 2 years. To be fair, I primarily used the toothbrush only on trips (I had another rechargeable at home), but my usually lasted a week at a time and I make these trips at least everyother week. Oh, I also brushed at least twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the bottom cap and o-ring are not exactly the best, but I have no problem with water coming in. After brushing, I rinsed the whole thing and left it stand vertically. I am on my 3rd set of batteries now. For me, it was a $25 well spent. I like it because I can get battery for it anywhere. I would buy another when this one dies someday. The only thing this toothbrush needs is pausing every 30 seconds like its other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/16/09:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months since my last review, my tooth brush died. I immediately ordered another one, same model. It came in orange color now and worked just as expected. I expect to use this for another 2 years at least.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for over a year now.  I did have the same issues that many who gave it a 1 star did.  It stopped working due to water penetrating the switch area from standing the unit on the counter after use.  At times, it would only run for a few secs.  I rectified this situation rather easily by just not standing the brush after use.  Just lay it on its back and water won&#x27;t run down from the brush into the switch/battery compartment.  Also, rinse the brush head thoroughly after use, unscrew the brushhead and clean under there periodically as well.  It has given me NO problems since I&#x27;ve stopped standing the brush up on the counter.    If anyone is still experiencing problems with intermittent power, just rinse the unit thorougly, lay the brush down on its back, and let it dry.  You&#x27;ll find that the unit will be fully functional again.  Great product!  For $25, I&#x27;ve no complaints at all.  And from what I can see, it&#x27;s no different from the rechargeable ones other than the fact that you must replace the AA batteries every couple months.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s possible that a lot of the people who think their unit &#x27;died&#x27; simply didn&#x27;t realize that the battery needed to be replaced.  With ordinary battery-powered toothbrushes, they sort of slow down when the battery is running out of power, but this one &#x27;stutters.&#x27;  It turns itself off after a few seconds, and the older the batteries get, the more often it turns itself off, so it&#x27;s possible somebody might think the unit has a short.  Replace the batteries, and it once again purrs like it&#x27;s new.    This is a great toothbrush.  Inexpensive, dependable, and works incredibly well.  I love mine.</li>
    <li> This product is junk.  I have had two of them and both of them failed.  This is not a sketchy complaint.   I am an engineer and, while some reviewers tell you to put silicon grease around the o-ring, I don&#x27;t believe that is something a consumer should have to do when purchasing a product.  I expect a company to sell me a product that will not break within a year.  There are design flaws with this product.  Unless you do not mind purchasing the same product every 6 months for clean teeth, do not buy.  I will not again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years and never had a problem, it works great and is excellent for traveling as you don&#x27;t have to carry around a charger which doesn&#x27;t work in some countries even with the right adaptors. The reviewers who complain about water getting into the battery compartment are obviously not looking after their toothbrush. You should remove the head after every use, shake and clean both head and handle which only takes a few seconds. I store the head separately and don&#x27;t leave it on when not in use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame that Amazon is no longer carrying this item. I bought mine in November 2009 for $26.99 - a great price.    I have been fortunate with the use of this toothbrush and, touch wood, that will continue. Previously I had had a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type Sonicare but not the latest model. This toothbrush has outperformed it in every way. I much prefer the relatively light brushhead and battery performance has been phenomenal. I am using two very high capacity rechargeable 2400 MAh batteries - an Alkaline AA has about 600MAh - and the first charge lasted over 2 months!!!    I suspect that battery capacity may be a factor in the performance experienced by other reviewers. The toothbrush is driven of course by an electric motor which will demand a relatively high amperage (in contrast with the current drawn by a TV remote, for example). The greater the capacity of the battery, the longer the motor will be able to perform without any hiccups. In the second month of my first charge period, I did experience a few stoppages but found that these were easily fixed by removing the brushhead and putting it back on. It may have been that some accumulated debris was causing friction that prevented the motor from turning - particularly as the charge in the batteries was depleted. I have not - fingers crossed - experienced any of the water related issue mentioned by other reviewers. The battery compartment seems very tight and waterproof to me and, again,  I wonder whether the problems that have been ascribed to water-related causes would have occurred with higher capacity batteries.</li>
    <li> If the Sonicare E3000 won&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s own for more than 3 weeks, then simply return it to Amazon for full refund.  Don&#x27;t you know you have a 60 day A to Z guarantee through Amazon?  That&#x27;s how you get the sellers to stop selling junk.  Return enough of them and don&#x27;t just complain in a product review.</li>
    <li> My hygienist warned me that I was brushing my teeth \\&quot;too hard\\&quot; and that my upper gums were starting to recede. Receding gums means a loss of gum tissue, which exposes the roots of the teeth (aka gingivial recession). When the gums erode away too much, it can lead to gum disease. Once the gums are gone, they-are-gone. She recommended switching to any type of Sonicare toothbrush. For brushing teeth, this type of toothbrush has \\&quot;high velocity bristle movement\\&quot; that results in direct contact with each tooth. According to the manufacturer the, \\&quot;patented sonic technology delivers a unique dynamic cleaning action for superior plaque reduction.\\&quot;  While searching on Amazon.com, I discovered the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush. This battery operated Sonicare is $29.99. When comparing prices, this was at the lower end. Some Sonicare toothbrushes were closer to $200. After reading the reviews for the $29.99 Sonicare Xtreme e3000 (battery operated) Power Toothbrush, I made the purchase.    The Review- This little Sonicare has a lot of power. The toothbrush does all the work, no need for me to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; at all really. I have had it for nine months now and love it. It sure beats paying for a higher priced one that requires a recharging base. The batteries last for at least one month, when using twice a day. I like how portable it is- I took it with me on our trip to Maine and on our camping trips. It is small so it travels well.     I noticed many negative reviews regarding how it \\&quot;short circuits when water gets inside of it.\\&quot; This has not happened to me, and I certainly don&#x27;t take the best of care to avoid getting water on it. It&#x27;s inevitable! It&#x27;s a toothbrush! However, to avoid that happening, try rinsing off and then towel drying your Sonicare after use. This will keep the batteries from getting wet. Or, just lay the toothbrush down on a dry surface so that water does not drip into the battery compartment at the bottom.     After using the brush for about five months, myfirst trip back to see the hygienist for a cleaning went very well. According to her, my \\&quot;gums look healthy\\&quot; and there was much less time spent scrapping plaque-which was priceless! For the oral hygenie benefits at such a small investment, I will continue using the Sonicare to brush my teeth!   [...]</li>
    <li> Bought 1 in December and it stopped working in January.  Returned it and got 1 that stopped working in February - one day after the warranty expired.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say I&#x27;ve gone through about 6 of these Philips E3000 Sonic toothbrushes in two years.  Why do I keep buying it; because when it works it is fantastic.  Philips has a great idea with idiot designers who fail to realize that this product is used with WATER and gets wet.  As many other have stated, the battery compartment is poorly sealed and eventually water seeps in and the unit dies.  This could be such a great product at an amazing price but the Philips designers seem to have a screw missing.  And while I&#x27;m on the subject, I have NEVER bought a Philips product, be it DVD Recorders, Players, etc that haven&#x27;t worked great for a while and then die.  And despite their Customer \\&quot;Service\\&quot; promise, it&#x27;s non-existent.  I purchased a new E3000 today (yes, I&#x27;m an idiot) and decided to register it online at their website.  Even THAT doesn&#x27;t work.  I went to the FAQs and it wouldn&#x27;t even open.  Does ANYONE know of another battery operated toothbrush at this price point that will work longer than it takes to replace the toothbrush heads?!! I&#x27;m afraid this is the last E3000 toothbrush I&#x27;ll ever get.  I stopped buying all of their other garbage products years ago.</li>
    <li> I have had my Sonicare e3000 for 17 months, purchased for 30 bucks.  I had wanted to check out ultrasonic toothbrushes for years, but they all cost hundreds of dollars and had fussy rechargeable batteries that die, and then you throw away a hundred dollar toothbrush.  Had to pass on that, but with a unit available for 30 bucks, I&#x27;m in for a test.    First, to address those who have had problems with water entry:  The end with the bristles goes into your mouth.  Hope this helps.    OK, perhaps sarcasm isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s called for here.  Look, it&#x27;s incredibly simple to prevent water from entering the battery compartment or the switch, without modifying anything.  Working backwards:    1. When you&#x27;re done, rinse the head like you would any other toothbrush, pointing downward so water doesn&#x27;t rain down the unit.  Then turn it on and let it shake all the water off the bristles.  If there&#x27;s water all over the outside of the unit, well you&#x27;re very likely standing in a bathroom, next to a towel.  Wipe it off.    2. Don&#x27;t use it in the shower or with sopping wet hands.  I really can&#x27;t imagine how else people are getting them wet enough to be a problem.    3. When it&#x27;s time to change the batteries, unscrew the brush, rinse the heck out of it, set it aside to dry, take a paper towel and wipe out the top of the unit where the the brush mounts.  Then take the battery cover off, remove the batteries, and make sure there&#x27;s no water there.  Use a paper towel to dry it up if it is damp, and just let it dry out before putting your fresh batteries in.    Done.  If you simply spend 5 seconds letting the brush shake the water out of itself and briefly dry the thing off before you set it down on the counter, this will NOT be a problem.       Now then, for some personal info I&#x27;d rather not share, but is important to the review.  I haven&#x27;t been great at brushing throughout life.  It&#x27;s difficult to get everywhere decently, takes too long to do it right, and even when I did everything right, every time - Three months after a checkup I&#x27;d still have scaly scummy stuff on my teeth that wouldn&#x27;t come off, and I could count on a new cavity or two every other checkup.    The VERY FIRST TIME I used this brush, it took off five months of tartar.  And I mean took it all off, *bing*, done.  You know that nice smooth feeling when you run your tongue across your teeth, that only happens for a few days after the hygienist comes at you with the steel hooks?  That happened after one brushing, and happens every day now.    The unit is easy to use, the head is smallish so it&#x27;ll get everywhere you need it to, and if you&#x27;re tired or your arms hurt or you&#x27;re just plain lazy, it couldn&#x27;t be much better than to just stand there moving very little and get clean teeth from a machine that actually works.    If you don&#x27;t like the idea of having to buy a bunch of batteries to feed into the beast, buy four AA rechargeables and a charger, and swap the two sets out once a week to keep from ever having to deal with the thing slowing down on you.  For a total of about fifty bucks for toothbrush, batteries and charger, you&#x27;ve got an ultrasonic that&#x27;s just as good as the $150 dollar ones, and easier to store and keep charged.    I&#x27;m already getting long-winded, so I&#x27;ll just sum up:    I have a mouth FULL of very expensive, painfully-installed metal.  Five full crowns, and as many fillings as I have teeth.  If this brush was in my bathroom when I was 20, I would have perhaps a filling or three instead.  My teeth are better, my gums are better, and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier than when I was poking around in my mouth with the manually-operated Oral-B brushes my dentist gave away for free.    It&#x27;s also better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used, and better than any spiffy manual toothbrush with weirdo bristles that allegedly go here and there but still don&#x27;t get your teeth clean.    Even if this thing died once a year and had to be replaced, it would still be a bargain, because it would cost lessthan one drill and fill of a new cavity.</li>
    <li> My previous Sonicare rechargeable was dying and I had just purchased the expensive replacement brushes. Dealing with the disposal of the expired Sonicare and its battery was such a hassle I vowed never to get another. i.e. You need a freakin&#x27; tool shop to get it apart. When I saw the e3000, which was priced around $30 and took the same brush head, I jumped at the chance...despite the complaints about the leakage and water damage.     I waited 6 months after my purchase before I reviewed the thing so I could give it a fair trial. I have used all types of rechargeable AA batteries with this toothbrush and it&#x27;s worked like a champ with all of them. In view of the warnings, the only precaution I take is to store it flat after giving it a quick wipe with a towel.</li>
    <li> This is NOT rechargeable.  Do you really want to keep on buying batterries for this?  Get a rechargeable one instead.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush for those looking for a travel version of the sonicare or a inexpensive way to get into sonicare brushing. This model has all the power of the sealed rechargeable models in a nice package for travel (I have both). I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and have never experienced the water issues that the other reviewers have but then I guess it&#x27;s just common sense to not submerse the brush in water! I rinse the head portion mainly but have gotten water splashed on the entire body of the brush and never had issues. my batter compartment and contacts look fine. I can see if you submersed it where there might be issues as the compartment just snaps on. I use NiMH rechargeable batteries in mine and they last about 2-3weeks, alkaline batteries (energizer) last much longer. The best part about Sonicare is how clean your teeth feel and a plus is easier dentist visits, cleanings are easier and the hygienists always comment on how good my teeth look. This was not the case before Sonicare!</li>
    <li> Great product, and there&#x27;s no problem with the batteries if you take some minimal care. Read on...    I&#x27;m a traveling consultant, and I&#x27;ve had two of these 3000-series toothbrushes over more than a hundred trips over the past two years -- only because the first was damaged during a trip to India. I stopped using my previous regular Sonicare unit because these work very very well, and with a pair of rechargeables, I get the benefit of both worlds.     Power and performance -- The brush head action feels the same as my older Sonicare. This is to say, strong and thorough with no complaints at all. The 3000 has a 2min timer and not the quadpacer control, but I don&#x27;t miss it.  As set of alkaline batteries lasts me for a month or more, while 2300mah NiMH AA&#x27;s last 1-2 weeks between charges.     Maintenance -- The skreechy complaints from previous reviewers about the battery compartment leaking water and destroying batteries are nonsense.  Let&#x27;s get real here: the 3000 is not the same design as the sealed-cell Sonicare units, and the fact that it has electrical contacts in an open-able compartment is not a design flaw (as some have declared).  In fact, I find this unit to be quite well-designed and simple, but it does need a little bit of care. Anyone who has used an underwater camera case or gone diving already knows how to take care of water gaskets, but for the uninitiated:  Dry gaskets do not provide a perfect seal on *any* product. In order to seal out water, the battery compartment gasket needs to be prepared before the first use, by swabbing a little bit of Vaseline or similar on  all sides of the gasket surface.  This will eventually degrade the gasket (lithium grease would be more appropriate), but it&#x27;s worked fine for more than a year on this last one. If I were hostile, I would take away a star because Philips/Sonicare should provide a small packet of gasket grease in the box, but other than that, it works perfectly after lots and lots of use.</li>
    <li> We bought two of these from Sam&#x27;s Club and both died within 3 months.  At first we thought it was a battery problem but then we discovered both toothbrushes took water into the battery chamber.  It was pretty yucky in there and despite cleaning the chambers and replacing the batteries the units both died an ugly death.  I liked the way it made my teeth feel really clean and will likely upgrade to a unit that does not require batteries.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is wonderful, when it is working.  Unfortunately, serious design flaws allow moisture to enter the battery compartment and corrode the battery contacts.  This is mildly annoying, at first, because you can usually get it going by tapping the toothbrush on the counter top.  Eventually, after a month or two, the battery contact will be so corroded that no amount of tapping will help and you have to go in with something abrasive (like sandpaper) to clean up the battery contact.  You would be better off with one of the rechargeable models that have sealed handles.</li>
    <li> This lasted about one week before dying. The battery compartment is seriously flawed. It should have been designed with a screw on top with the o-ring, like a flashlight, instead of a push on top. It will not seal properly. Do not waste your money on this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Too many reviews;  I&#x27;ll do this one in Haiku!  Let&#x27;s dive into it.    Saw all prior views  of Sonicare customers  Amazon provides.    Key to the debate:  whether cheaper is better,  or price wins the day.    Higher on dollars --  e7300 (\\&quot;e seventy-three hundred\\&quot;) --   link given below.  [[ASIN:B00008BFXJ Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush]]    Then there is this brush.  Cheaper, with features to match  (save only a few).    We bought both brushes,  one each for my wife and me.  Experimented.    Used both Sonicares.  Brushed ev&#x27;ry night, she and I.  Same treatment, same care.    Endlessly we sparred.  Three months later, here we are.  One emerged victor.    Three months was too much --  for the cheaper brush was crushed.  Suddenly it died.    No water damage,  no mishandling, no neglect.  It just died -- kaput!    Here is my advice:  for relability  shun the cheaper brush.    Yet consider this:  THAT costs three times more than THIS.  It should give you pause.    Seems the math is thus:  THREE times failed before we must  declare one the best.    For is this not true:  fail three times before I do  end up losing out?    The price of one though  more reliable, cannot  beat the other&#x27;s cost.    Friend, it&#x27;s up to you.  Buy the best or try for two;  Less than three duds wins!</li>
    <li> I tried... twice.  But both of these \\&quot;toy toothbrushes\\&quot; quit working.  In the past I had a great experience with an older Sonicare toothbrush and was hoping for similar quality with this simpler, cheaper and replaceable battery powered device.  No such luck.  After a couple weeks it just stopped.  Phillips was kind enough to replace it but the replacement also failed after a couple weeks.  My advise is to avoid the Xtreme and buy the higher price device (or stick to the simple manual toothbrush).</li>
    <li> If you are thinking about purchasing this I would highly discourage you. My wife bought one of these and she liked it so much that she bought one for me too. Within about 4 weeks her brush began shutting off and eventually stopped working. I was hopeful that mine would last. However after about 4 weeks of total use, mine would cut off after about 10 seconds of use. Eventually it completely stopped working. It was not batteries or any other obvious problem. Both were defective. It most likely stems from water in the internal compartment. It was very frustrating. I would recommend going with an Oral-B or a more durable Sonicare. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, when this thing was working, it really did clean my teeth well, but it quickly failed. Invest in a longer lasting brush!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for your teeth, all for less than other expensive e-toothbrushes.      For those users giving this product a bad rating while complaining about water corroding the battery compartment, it is obvious that these people are 1) droolers (feeble-mind), and 2) feeble-arm (since they cannot even keep the handle above their mouth for a simple two-minutes brushing). How else can the water get into the battery area.      Here is a simple solution: I went to Walmart and bought myself a roll of \\&quot;white\\&quot; duct tape, cut out a three inches strip, and made a one-wrap-around the battery compartment (at the far end of the handle). This will ensure that no water will ever get into the battery compartment period.  The water-sealed duct tape can be easily peeled open when you need to replace the batteries 90 days later.  The white duct tape will blend in with the white handle, so you hardly notice it.     Once this is done, I can brush forever while lowering the handle (relative to your mouth) without worrying about the foam running down the handle and stand it upright after I finish.</li>
    <li> I have owned this Sonicare toothbrush for about two months now and I love it! I hesitated on buying it because of some of the negative reviews. I have not had any trouble with the battery compartment, but because of the reviews Iread, I try to remember to pop off the bottom of the compartment after using the toothbrush and lay it on its side next to the toothpaste. Maybe this is asking too much for some people, but I like this thing enough that the 3 seconds it takes to pop it off and put it back on are no big deal. As soon as I started using the e3000, I could really feel how clean my teeth were. A lot of electric toothbrushes offer superior cleaning to a manual toothbrush, though. What really hooked me was that about 2 weeks ago, I was putting on lipstick and when I smiled at myself in the mirror afterwards, I was greeted with really white teeth. I am an ex-smoker and love coffee, and even with regular dental cleanings, not all of the staining comes off. But this toothbrush has! I love it, and even if two months from now it stops working, I&#x27;m likely to buy a new one. I might consider one of the more expensive ones, but I like having the battery operated for travelling and that it takes up less space on the bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> This is my second sonicare e3000 - the first replaced after about 8 months.  For the money this is definitely worth it.  If it fails in the first few weeks or months contact them as sonicare will stand by it.  It is a SONIC toothbrush for $30 or less so what can you expect.  Last time I had the battery cap/connection problem.  I find the mold inside worse this time for some reason?  I think this one allows more water into the top, but the battery compartment tighter - so inconsistent quality.  Unfortunately this unit takes the more expensive heads. But I read that once the battery dies on the expensive unit/flexcare then you basically have to replace whole unit - with that money you can buy like 4 of these!  I think this is the best bang for your buck and recommend to use rechargeable batteries to save the planet!  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a regular plug in Sonicaire unit for four years and was excited to lose the cord, I&#x27;ve moved and the outlet in my new bathroom was not in the best place.  First and foremost, my biggest concern was that this battery operated unit would not be powerful enough.  It actually feels more powerful.  I also love that you can use the larger brush heads from the other model.    Now the downside, as others have pointed out, the battery compartment allows water to get in and then it stops running.  This happened after my FIRST time using it so I can&#x27;t imagine that Philips put any kind of testing in to this product.  All they would have needed to do is, um, well, had a tester brush their teeth with water once or twice.  The first few days I was opening it and drying the batteries off and ready to return it.  Until I read a review that suggested putting vaseline around the O ring.  This did the trick and I will be keeping the toothbrush.  FYI: I purchased on 9/15/08 at Target. so the reader who commented in July that the problem might be fixed, they must have gotten lucky!    Also just wanted to comment for the reviewer who stated that \\&quot;everyone\\&quot; knows that you need to put vaseline to make something waterproof.  I consider myself fairly intelligent and am a college graduate and didn&#x27;t know this; however I do have three waterproof electonic items that never have this issue.  I&#x27;m thinking Philips can figure out a way to make it work too.  Or at a minimum put a note in their directions.</li>
    <li> I have a fish tank, and Vaseline is what you use to prevent water from leaking at each fitting, at least on the water filter/pump, where there are o-rings. So maybe for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s just experience. My first toothbrush leaked (who knew?) and my second I went strait to the vaseline. I am hoping that will do the trick. Also without the vaseline, the rubber o-ring can twist as you put the cap on, as experienced with my tank. Vaseline, as a lubricant, will prevent this twisting so the ring keeps it&#x27;s intended form and stops the water from getting in. Also Vaseline will repel the water and prevent it from wicking passed the o-ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this does to the warrenty, I don&#x27;t know. However, Philips needs to be understanding of this situation and accept returns with a bit of grease around the ring, if the unit fails of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first unit failed from water getting into the battery compartment. But I won&#x27;t count that against them. Philips is exchanging mine for a replacement, no arguments and it took 5 minutes over an IM session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart People they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, SERIOUSLY I am using the same tooth brush - different head of course. My wife is using one too. Every time I replace the brush head, I take the thing apart, clean it out, re-apply vaseline, and I am ready for the next round. Just like new. You can still buy the brush, batteries last a very long time. Forget the rechargeable units. I bet you would have to throw them out by now. Spend all that money just to toss it in the can. This unit, is the best one. Not a lot of features, but it has the single best one, replaceable batteries.</li>
    <li> There seem to be scores of reviews of this item -- so why add another? Because many here claim the battery operated Sonicare isn&#x27;t worth the candle, due to water intrusion and corrosion in the battery compartment. I beg to differ.    I have used Sonicare toothbrushes ever since this lineup was first introduced about two decades ago.  Until recently, I bought the top of the line, rechargeable models, which sell for three or four times the price of this battery model and seem to give up the ghost every three years or so.      Then one fine day, I went to the local drugstore to buy replacement brush heads and found this nifty battery operated model -- for about the same price as a set of two brushes for my fancy rechargeable model.  No brainer! I grabbed the brushes and the battery powered Sonicare.       I have had my battery operated model for about three years now.  The pros are: (1) no charger to fuss with; (2) it works anywhere in the world without plug adapters and voltage converters; (3) it is inexpensive; and (4) it works, consistently.  The cons are: sorry, I cannot think of one.    Water intrusion and corrosion? Well, not to get too personal, but I&#x27;m one of those folks who likes to brush in the shower.  I leave the Sonicare in the shower caddy much of the time so I won&#x27;t have to go searching around dripping wet for it in the wee hours of the morning.  Hundreds and hundreds of showers later, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.      My conclusion is unless you take the thing into the bathtub and use it to play submarines and battleships (something I admittedly have not attempted), it will continue working despite significant exposure to moisture.  And with battery replacement required about every 90 days or so, it&#x27;s simple and economical to operate.    Bottom line: it&#x27;s cheap, it works, it&#x27;s great for travel anywhere on earth without the need to lug charging paraphernalia along. I find nothing at all not to like.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s do the math... what would you say if I told you that, if you paid three times as much, you could buy a quality Sonicare toothbrush [[ASIN:B0015INAVC Philips HX7361 Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush]] that lasted 20 times as long and never needed a battery? Or, if you paid about twice as much you could buy another quality Sonicare toothbrush [[ASIN:B00008BFXG Philips Sonicare Advance 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush]] that lasted probably 10 times as long and, it too, never needed another battery?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rest my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought 2 of these for the kids. One of them stopped working after a couple of days. Amazon sent us a replacement. Then, both of them stopped working a few weeks later. Eventually, we  bought our kids some good quality Sonicares and they never failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal Sonicare experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My first one, the &#x27;original&#x27;, lasted some 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;- I bought an Elite 3 years ago in December and it&#x27;s almost as good as new today (minor wear on the rubberized sides).&lt;br /&gt;- I bought the kids their Elites about one year ago and they are as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with the Elite and be happy or buy these and you are likely to be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Philips Sonicare for over 3yrs now and it&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had. It brushes well, is portable and the batteries last forever. You can store it horizontally, don&#x27;t have to worry about remembering to recharge it and the brush heads for the more expensive models fit this one too. As long as you keep the main body clean and dry, this is a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought mine - and after a few weeks - 4 more for my family.  High frequency vibrations work so much better than hand brushing or cheaper ($8) reciprocating brushes.  I really never knew how clean my teeth could feel.    I had read reviews about poor durability of this model and took the chance figuring I could return it if I needed to. The seal around the bottom is an o-ring, which I assume is a design upgrade from earlier versions.  Whether improved or not, after 4 months, I see NO evidence of any battery contact corrosion.  Yes, I do take off the brush to clean the top bit every week or two, no issue. I&#x27;ve never had to clean the battery compartment.    In general, it&#x27;s a clever design with the brush driven by magnetic force from a spinning motor sealed in the handle. I don&#x27;t see this relatively inexpensive hygiene tool as a \\&quot;cheapie\\&quot;.  For reasons explained below, I prefer it to the more expensive options.  After 4 months, the original brush is still in good shape, so if I buy a new pair of heads every 9 months or so, it&#x27;s not very expensive when you figure these brushes are much gentler to your gums than manual brushing.  I&#x27;ll still have my teeth when I&#x27;m 90!     This model uses AA batteries, which I prefer to the more expensive models that have their special batteries built in.  With AA batts, I don&#x27;t need a power cord sitting on the sink or vanity.  My strategy is to buy a good set of 4 rechargeable batteries and a charger for under $20.  Get Duracell, Rayovac, or Eveready. For rechargeable batteries, off-brands are really a poor bet IMO - though I haven&#x27;t tested them all.  With the right batteries, you&#x27;ll save $$ over the long term AND know you&#x27;re contributing a smidge less to hazardous waste from constantly buying and tossing conventional batteries. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the \\&quot;hybrid\\&quot; precharged/ slow discharge rechargeables.  The hybrids are only an advantage in things that are seldom used, and are a disadvantage in often used tools/ toys.  The \\&quot;normal\\&quot; rechargeable batteries hold 1.5 x the charge of the hybrids, and will last typically over a month when brushing twice a day.  If you look for brand name rechargeables that are rated for 2500 mAH or more, you have the right ones.  Also, if you can find a digital camera that uses AA batts, you have one common energy currency.  On a long trip, you can carry a few extra alkaline AAs and never be left \\&quot;down\\&quot; for need of batteries.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome. I have used other battery powered toothbrushes from crest and colgate but this is in it&#x27;s own class. The sonicare technology from the much more expensive rechargeable versions is apparent. This toothbrush cleans your teeth like no other battery powered toothbrush I have come across and for $30 its a complete steal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these and none of them lasted more than a month. DON&#x27;T purchase this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these four months ago - one for me, and one for my mom. Neither of us have had any problems with it! My mom uses hers 4 times a day due to periodontal issues. These were replacements for our traditional rechargeable Sonicares, which after 3 years could no longer hold a charge. Those cost $160 each; these were only $30. Even if they end up needing to be replaced more frequently, I think these are still a better value for the money.    I immediately noticed that this model brushed much faster than my rechargeable. This leads me to think that even when the rechargeable was \\&quot;fully charged,\\&quot; it wasn&#x27;t brushing at its highest power. I also noticed that it brushed much LONGER than the rechargeable; I think the traditional model was pooping out after just a minute or so - again, even when fully charged. I&#x27;m not sure I understand how folks are getting water into the battery compartment at the bottom of the unit...keep the bottom end dry, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I like it, my wife hates it (I bought two).  She says that it looses power too fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for 3 1/2 months without any problems. I bought it after reading many reviews complaining that the innards got wet, corroded and rendered it useless. So I took care not to immerse the bottom of the brush handle where the battery is located, and dried it off with a towell after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first set of batteries lasted over three month (!), around six times longer than the normal Sonic Care rechargeables even when they&#x27;re new (and towards the end my previous Sonicare could only hold its charge for one day). The trick is using good NiMH batteries--in this case, a pair of fresh La Crosse 2600 mAh batteries, charged with a high quality pulse charger (from Maha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to improve the waterproof quality of the o-ring greatly, lubricate it with silicone grease--the sort sold for the o-rings in underwater camera housings. However, I haven&#x27;t done this with my Sonicare yet. I just know it works because I&#x27;m an underwater photographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can see Sonic Care marketing this as aimed at kids is the low price. The brush seems to work the same way. I do miss the way the other Sonicare brushes give you a time marker for each side/set of teeth, but I&#x27;m learned to get it pretty close now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the extremely long battery life and the ability to recharge it with the same charger I use for other battery-operated devices, and its use of standard AA batteries, all combine to make this actually superior to all other Sonic Care brushes, regardless of price (and this is about 1/4 the price of the others). So you should get this one as long as you&#x27;re willing and able to exercise reasonable care with its semi-waterproof handle cap end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blogzudotblogspotdotcom</li>
    <li> This works great.  My wife&#x27;s model showed the same issues mentioned with water and corrosion in the battery compartment.  I lay mine flat in the cabinet and I haven&#x27;t had an issue in six months.  My battery compartment is pristine.  Simple solution.</li>
    <li> I purchased an original Sonicare that lasted about one year, so I decided to try cheaper e3000 with replaceable batteries.  This one last almost the exact same amount of time.  Both the e3000 and rechargeable Sonicare I had worked pretty much the same.  I just purchased my second e3000.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one and am really unhappy with it: (1) the battery compartment has these little teeth that break off if you set it down too abruptly (and I mean to prevent this you have to treat it like delicate glass) . I tried taping the bottom but that didn&#x27;t last long. (2) What another reviewer said was true, water gets inside the battery unit and shorts it  (3) the brush replacements are very expensive (4) batteries used up pretty quickly, although I would have been willing to live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love what this toothbrush does for my teeth, and since I have a small bath  and a lot of electronics in there already I really wanted a cordless one.  But the defects are unacceptable.  I am now looking for another model.</li>
    <li> Overall, I give the toothbrush a strong but not perfect recommendation. It&#x27;s the best toothbrush you can get for $30.    First the downside, we bought four of these.  One of them failed within two weeks.  It simply stopped working - even with fresh batteries.  After contacting Sonicare, they agreed to swap it out for a new one.    On the plus side, the performance is excellent.  With alkaline or NiMh batteries, the run time is far superior to the Sonicare rechargeable units costing many times more.  Also, the performance seems to remain strong throughout the battery wear cycle.  On the rechargeable units, after you&#x27;ve had them for a while, the power seems to begin depleting noticeably without constantly have the unit on the recharger.      No it does not have all the bells and whistles. But this unit delivers top-rated Sonicare toothbrush performance - at a fraction of the cost of Sonicare&#x27;s higher end units.</li>
    <li> First got the Oral B Vitality Sonic, then I saw the online picture of Sonicare toothbrush on water, which blasts water away. This sonicare is much stronger than Oral B.  And using my own AA battery is a plus.    There are many negative reviews.  Most are about water damage, and water going in the battery compartment.   I changed the O-Ring, as suggested by another reviewer   to 1-1/16\\&quot; x 15/16\\&quot; x 1/16\\&quot;.  It is possible the manufacturer used 15mm thick O-ring, the european standard, and American uses 1/16 inch or 15.8mm.  Also, I added a silicone tape (from HomeDepot) to the top of the O-ring. That tape was expensive, but is waterproof. Also added petroleum jelly to the 2 holes at the bottom to waterproof.  Does the current generation know nothing about waterproofing with Petroleum Jelly ? Are you that stupid ??    After brushing, I hang my Sonicare Xtreme toothbrush upside down, so that any water on the toothbrush will not go down into the unit.  How do I hang it upside down ? Use the 3M Command 17201 Medium Picture Hanging Strips. Not a cloth velcro, which does not work when wet.    It is not pretty upside down, but it won&#x27;t be out-of-order.    The downside for me is, the replacement head is at least $11 each. Just bought a pack of 4 from Costco for $39.99 plus tax.    I will update in the future on whether water damage still occurs, and how I will get around the $11 replacement head. Hint, you need a drill and 2 small screws and 2 nuts</li>
    <li> One my second of this toothbrush in six months.  Love the way it cleans, but the battery&lt;br /&gt;pack cap at the bottom does not fit securely on the toothbrush.  I had problems replacing&lt;br /&gt;the cap after I changed the batteries on brush #1 and I can&#x27;t get the cap on at all&lt;br /&gt;on brand new brush #2.  Oy!</li>
