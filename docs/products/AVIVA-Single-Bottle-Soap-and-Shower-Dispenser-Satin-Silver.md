      <li>, looks nice, easy to refill. :)</li>
      <li>which means it doesn&#x27;t work for most of the conditioners my fiancée uses.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Particularly viscous soaps will require a lot of priming, probably a lot more than you would expect.  </li>
      <li>SURE you put the bracket on right-side up before you apply the adhesive.  </li>

      <li>It is easy to hang, easy to use</li>
      <li>If I used shower gel, I&#x27;d probably get the one with 3 chambers instead of two, but for me, the 2-chamber one is fine.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo seems to work just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely cheap quality ..</li>

      <li>This one adds a more modern look to our remodeled shower.  </li>
      <li>quick tips:&lt;br</li>

      <li>I also like that I can fill them without having to remove the chambers from the walls tho they lift off much more easily than in the basic model.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved it, and decided to add it to the other bathrooms, too.</li>
      <li>Looks attractive even in plastic, dispenses thick soap/body washes I use, and does not require drilling, only silicone glue (which easily removes with sticky removers. :)</li>
      <li>I have a small shower that gets cluttered with shampoo bottles, so I thought this would be a great space saver.</li>
      <li>had briefly considered getting the simplehuman version of these dispensers, but from the reviews it looks like the pump mechanism (which is a protruding handle that must be pushed down) requires a fair amount of pressure and hence easily snaps off.  </li>
      <li>(luckily I realized it before the adhesive dried) and I&#x27;m a generally handy person.  </li>
      <li>The product is easy to install, looks great, but it doesn&#x27;t have a real pump mechanism and the tubing is very thin -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s holding up very well</li>
      <li>even though I speak Spanish, it would have been nice to have two &amp;#34;body wash&amp;#34; labels in English.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on my original fill of shower gel and shampoo since I purchased it, and that was quite awhile ago--with plenty left to go.</li>
      <li>Took only 10 minutes and holds both completely full.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It is easiest if you put a little water in the bottom and then the soap on top to allow it to catch prime.</li>
      <li>Takes about three or four pumps to get the amount of shampoo I would normally use.</li>
      <li>I moved to a new apartment and just had to purchase another one.  </li>
      <li>I was pumping for a good minute at least and starting to wonder if it was a faulty pump before it started coming out.  </li>
      <li>Bought this several months ago and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>but I managed to get too excited and put mine on upside down</li>
      <li>But my experience with similar devices mounted in the same way tells me that as long as you clean the surface REALLY WELL and use ALL THE GLUE</li>

      <li>I use this in my vacation rental house and the problem is that you can only really use rather watery shampoos, soaps, etc.  </li>

      <li>I keep the soap full of Doctor Bronner&#x27;s, and the other full of a very thick shampoo.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the box it came in was WAY oversized to the point that all the packing peanuts filled a large garbage bag.</li>

<li> It also made me realize how much shampoo I regularly waste!</li>
<li> I have long hair, and I only need about three pumps of shampoo to get the job done.</li>
<li> We installed this dispenser about two weeks ago, so not enough time has passed to determine how long it will hold up.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m generally pretty obsessed with keeping things organized and clean in my home (pretty much the opposite of my parents), so I hate having a bunch of grungy bottles of shampoo and soap all over my shower.  </li>
<li> These, on the other hand, are simple inward pressing buttons that work well and should last for a while.  </li>
<li> /&gt;People weren&#x27;t kidding when they say it saves money in the long run.</li>
<li> I will definitely purchase another one for the other bathroom in my home.</li>
<li> came with silicone glue that you let dry for 24 hours.</li>
<li> The bracket doesn&#x27;t have an obvious up and down so use the canisters to check.&lt;br</li>
<li> Only complaint is that the pump won&#x27;t work unless that compartment is at least half full.</li>
<li> I use shampoo in one side and conditioner in the other.  </li>
<li> It does dispense a small quantity per pump, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me or my wife and daughter who both have long hair.</li>
<li> it has not fallen down yet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so convenient and you use so much less shampoo or conditioner.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think my husband and I wasted shampoo and conditioner, but since it&#x27;s premeasured, you do use less.</li>
<li> If it gets TOO empty, it has to be primed 2 or 3 times to work again, but seriously, it takes about 10 seconds to do that.  </li>
<li> Also, my shampoo was too thick for the dispenser to pump, so I watered it down a bit</li>
<li> The satin finish is a nice touch, because I hate the look of fake plastic</li>
<li> I have a small bathroom.</li>
<li> arrived with one cracked and the other broken tab that holds it to wall, the cracked side doesn&#x27;t dispense soap at all.</li>
<li> I got Satin, as the Chrome I had in my bathroom was hard to keep shiny from the water stains.</li>
<li> they work well even with thick conditioners.</li>
<li> I have thick shampoo in both sides and there is no problem getting it to dispense.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this in my vacation rental house and the problem is that you can only really use rather watery shampoos, soaps, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried conditioners and they gunk up the unit, making it unusable.  Shampoo seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> Pretty good dispenser - installing was straight forward and easy. I used the entire tube of the adhesive and allowed it to sit for 24 hours before putting the actual dispensers on. It&#x27;s holding up very well so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People weren&#x27;t kidding when they say it saves money in the long run. I&#x27;m still on my original fill of shower gel and shampoo since I purchased it, and that was quite awhile ago--with plenty left to go.</li>
    <li> Two years later, these still look like new. Purchased one for each bathroom. Rather than using the included tape, I used commands removable 16lb tape to adhere it to the tile, and then sealed around the item with clear silicone. Took only 10 minutes and holds both completely full.</li>
    <li> This looks great in the shower, saves space, and helps you save on soap, too. I didn&#x27;t think my husband and I wasted shampoo and conditioner, but since it&#x27;s premeasured, you do use less. I also ordered the dispenser with the basket in between the pumps. The basket is perfect for holding a bar of soap and some shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Looks better in the box .. It&#x27;s extremely cheap quality .. Pump didn&#x27;t last more than 30 days!!</li>
    <li> Space saver! I have a small bathroom. Works like a CHAAAAHM (Boston accent)</li>
    <li> Love the company and the dispenser.  This is the second set I have purchased.  The company even has a warranty on the pump mechanism.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these in the master bath for several years. I am adding one to the guest bath after my grandchildren requested one for their bathroom when they visit.</li>
    <li> The item works great and arrived in great shape. Unfortunately the box it came in was WAY oversized to the point that all the packing peanuts filled a large garbage bag. The level of the peanuts dropped one inch after the product was removed from the box. Between the peanuts in the box and the way the dispenser was packed in its own packaging I would have been very surprised if it had arrived damaged had they just slapped a shipping label on the original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the concerns about filling our landfills and recycling it would be nice if there was a more conscientious way to take care of it.</li>
    <li> No problems.  Stuck to the wall easily and securly.  Works as advertised.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> arrived with one cracked and the other broken tab that holds it to wall, the cracked side doesn&#x27;t dispense soap at all.</li>
    <li> I bought a home with a 3-Chamber dispenser from Aviva installed. I&#x27;ve loved it, and decided to add it to the other bathrooms, too. The install was super easy (as in...no husband required) with clear instructions. It seemed to set perfectly, and now my kids don&#x27;t have bottles of shampoo/conditioner floating around their tub/shower. I got Satin, as the Chrome I had in my bathroom was hard to keep shiny from the water stains.</li>
    <li> Bought this several months ago and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  I use shampoo in one side and conditioner in the other.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten clogged and is super easy to refill.  If it gets TOO empty, it has to be primed 2 or 3 times to work again, but seriously, it takes about 10 seconds to do that.  Not a big deal.  It took a whopping 5 minutes to install and it looks great in my shower.  If I used shower gel, I&#x27;d probably get the one with 3 chambers instead of two, but for me, the 2-chamber one is fine.  It&#x27;s also nice having fewer bottles of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in the shower.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Hangs easily with provided sticky foam. Only complaint is that the pump won&#x27;t work unless that compartment is at least half full.</li>
    <li> I had the Three Chamber model and one chamber broke after 6 months. Had to buy this one so that I would have a replacement chamber.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, the size of the dispensers are pretty small.</li>
    <li> I had no problems installing this on the shower.  Now I don&#x27;t have shampoo bottles sitting everywhere.</li>
    <li> easy to use and install. came with silicone glue that you let dry for 24 hours. Labels are easy to apply. have not had any issued with the pumps. they work well even with thick conditioners. it has not fallen down yet.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase, mounts easily when you follow the instructions.  No problems with leaking or product delivery when you follow the included instructions.  I would have included a few more labels in English, even though I speak Spanish, it would have been nice to have two &amp;#34;body wash&amp;#34; labels in English.  Saw same product in Lowes.  Price before buying, especially if you are paying shipping.</li>
    <li> This things are great I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten them years ago. Takes about three or four pumps to get the amount of shampoo I would normally use. Very easy to remove and refill. Highly recommended. Keep in mind that uses silicone to secure it to the wall and requires 24 hours of drying before use.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this shampoo dispenser about a month now and it was easy to install and use. I have thick shampoo in both sides and there is no problem getting it to dispense. Prime it like the instructions say and you should have no problem. It does dispense a small quantity per pump, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me or my wife and daughter who both have long hair. It doesn&#x27;t drip or have bad habits that we have found to date. Buy one, you will like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after staying in a hotel with the dispensers. I have a small shower that gets cluttered with shampoo bottles, so I thought this would be a great space saver. Installation was a breeze; I used tape and the level on my iPhone to make sure that the mount piece would be good and straight. It also made me realize how much shampoo I regularly waste! I have long hair, and I only need about three pumps of shampoo to get the job done. It&#x27;ll be a great money saver in the long run. I will definitely purchase another one for the other bathroom in my home.</li>
    <li> Excellent 2-sided dispenser. Looks attractive even in plastic, dispenses thick soap/body washes I use, and does not require drilling, only silicone glue (which easily removes with sticky removers. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Satin Silver&amp;#34; finish looks wonderful with my nickel/brushed metal looking shower rod and shower spout/knob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has been very durable for the last 3 months, no issues. Pumps work well, looks nice, easy to refill. :)</li>
    <li> I keep the soap full of Doctor Bronner&#x27;s, and the other full of a very thick shampoo. When I first filled the two reservoirs I was concerned because the shampoo wouldn&#x27;t flow. It took a day, but the next morning I was able to get the perfect amount of shampoo with two pumps. I&#x27;m concerned about how well it will hold up to bathroom cleaning products. I will update in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Made of plastic, looked like some type of metal</li>
    <li> The product is easy to install, looks great, but it doesn&#x27;t have a real pump mechanism and the tubing is very thin - which means it doesn&#x27;t work for most of the conditioners my fiancée uses. I tried packing the conditioner down to make sure there were no air bubbles, watering it down a bit to get the flow going, nothing worked. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> We installed this dispenser about two weeks ago, so not enough time has passed to determine how long it will hold up.  But my experience with similar devices mounted in the same way tells me that as long as you clean the surface REALLY WELL and use ALL THE GLUE it will stay up.  Also, my shampoo was too thick for the dispenser to pump, so I watered it down a bit and now it works great.</li>
    <li> The Better Living pump dispensers have enabled my stroke survivor brother to take a shower without help.  We just upgraded to this one after using the basic white 4 chamber for 2 years without a hitch.  We use thick conditioner, body scrub and thin liquid shampoo.  It handles all equally well.  This one adds a more modern look to our remodeled shower.  It attached easily to the wall with the provided stickers and glue.  I also like that I can fill them without having to remove the chambers from the walls tho they lift off much more easily than in the basic model.</li>
    <li> The chrome in the photo is very cheesy and flake looking plastic that looks like plastic. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I moved to a new apartment and just had to purchase another one.  It&#x27;s so convenient and you use so much less shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> And it is nice and easy to fill and the renters love not having to bring shampoo and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Looked around and searched your store and fond that a lot of people liked this product so I decided to try it too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It is easy to hang, easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t leak. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally pretty obsessed with keeping things organized and clean in my home (pretty much the opposite of my parents), so I hate having a bunch of grungy bottles of shampoo and soap all over my shower.  These are the perfect solution, they are discreet and clean, and the mounting is very secure and easy (it comes with silicone adhesive as well as sticky pads).  The satin finish is a nice touch, because I hate the look of fake plastic chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had briefly considered getting the simplehuman version of these dispensers, but from the reviews it looks like the pump mechanism (which is a protruding handle that must be pushed down) requires a fair amount of pressure and hence easily snaps off.  These, on the other hand, are simple inward pressing buttons that work well and should last for a while.  I&#x27;m going to order a second set of these for my shower and shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAKE SURE you put the bracket on right-side up before you apply the adhesive.  This sounds dumb and self explanatory but I managed to get too excited and put mine on upside down (luckily I realized it before the adhesive dried) and I&#x27;m a generally handy person.  The bracket doesn&#x27;t have an obvious up and down so use the canisters to check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Particularly viscous soaps will require a lot of priming, probably a lot more than you would expect.  I was pumping for a good minute at least and starting to wonder if it was a faulty pump before it started coming out.  It is easiest if you put a little water in the bottom and then the soap on top to allow it to catch prime.</li>
