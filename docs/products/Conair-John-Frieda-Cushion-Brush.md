### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>There is no specification in the box indicating what you may see after using it or else, I am disapointed because I thought it would be great.</li>
      <li>my granddaughter had fly away hair and this solved the problem.  </li>
      <li>and I still think it is a good deal.  </li>
      <li>A friend bought a $99.00 ionic brush and I tried it and loved it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this brush!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I bought 3 more</li>
      <li>The switch moves very easily and it is easy to unintentionally burn out the batteries.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was too good to be true, but I bought it anyway and returned it quickly.</li>
      <li>Maybe the free replacement that I get tomorrow will be a better on.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to accidentally leave it on.</li>
      <li>Switches off easily while in use.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
      <li>I have to confess that I purchased my brush on ebay rather than amazon (best available price) - but the product has such mixed reviews that I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay top dollar.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special about this brush.  </li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t even worthy of being called a brush.</li>
      <li>This brush requires batteries, but it really does get tangles out and smooth hair.</li>
      <li>it noticably reduces the effects of static, especially on thinner hair.  </li>
      <li>Within 5 minutes after installing batteries, the handle of the brush became way too hot...</li>
      <li>Batteries were incredibly hot to remove.</li>
      <li>I will be returning this as soon as possible for refund, as I don&#x27;t feel it is a safe product to leave unattended.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;On&amp;#34; indicator light can only be seen from just the right angle, so</li>
      <li>I verified the expiration date was still valid, however replaced with a new set of batteries (different brand this time) just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just the first set that was the problem.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not dramatic, but it&#x27;s not my imagination either.</li>
      <li>and it makes it so shinny and really helps with frizz.</li>
      <li>So I go on amazon and found the john frieda brush much much cheaper</li>
      <li>It really does work.  </li>
      <li>I was happy enough with the results that I purchased a second discount John Frieda ionic brush from the same seller.</li>
      <li>I have long straight hair without much volume so I avoid heat and products 99% of the time.  </li>
      <li>I had 2 other similar brushes over a period of 5 or 6 years  that emitted a clean scent leaving hair shiny!</li>
      <li>However, I have to say that it definitely does reduce static in my fine, thin, flyaway hair, as a result of which I see a definite improvement when I use it.</li>
      <li>But as far as the ions preventing styling damage, you can&#x27;t see something being prevented, (think about it).  </li>
      <li>My one complaint is that the on/off switch doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; so that it easily switches modes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now gone through four batteries, even though I&#x27;ve barely used the brush.</li>

<li> Wasted money!</li>
<li> I have heavily processed hair and my stylist recommends rinsing my hair with cold water before getting out of the shower to close up and seal the cuticle, which, in addition to making smoothing out the individual strands, helps protect it from styling damage.  </li>
<li> It may not work on every hair type, but I would recommend it for thin frizzy hair types (me!).</li>
<li> It make weird noise and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair.</li>
<li> In the winter that is very uncomfortable and this brush seemed to provide an alternative to freeezing myself.  </li>
<li> I have added a photo here for those who are asking the battery size (AAA) and whether the base is detachable or not (I can&#x27;t detach it).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my granddaughter had fly away hair and this solved the problem.  I bought 3 more</li>
    <li> This is a gimmick.  There is nothing special about this brush.  And, the switch turns off when you use it.  Don&#x27;t pay extra.  It&#x27;s not worth it.  Just buy a regular brush!</li>
    <li> my ionic brush broke and I have to have something to control my coarse thick hair and this helps a lot.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wasted money! I had 2 other similar brushes over a period of 5 or 6 years  that emitted a clean scent leaving hair shiny! These succumb to over use not owing me a penney. This one isn&#x27;t even worthy of being called a brush.</li>
    <li> Switches off easily while in use. &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; indicator light can only be seen from just the right angle, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally leave it on. It doesn&#x27;t automatically turn off, so there go the batteries. I&#x27;ve now gone through four batteries, even though I&#x27;ve barely used the brush.</li>
    <li> It really does work.  This brush requires batteries, but it really does get tangles out and smooth hair. One time the batteries ran out, and I totally noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This was not really what I was looking for.  I just wanted a hairbrush.  Didn&#x27;t realize this would need batteries.  I am keeping it and will use as a Christmas gift, but next time I&#x27;ll look a bit closer before ordering.</li>
    <li> This is as advertised. The switch moves very easily and it is easy to unintentionally burn out the batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush!  I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it was on clearance at Kmart for $5.  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and would gladly pay $19 for a replacement if it ever does fail me.  I have long straight hair without much volume so I avoid heat and products 99% of the time.  This brush smooths the frizz and flyaways anytime and anywhere!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it would do what they say it would, but it has proven itself worthy of been used for ionizing and strengthening hair; needlessly, I prefer the Revlon Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer, which does the same thing and less work.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used John Frieda hair products for years and I cannot believe they would put this brush on the market.  Says it works for any thickness of hair, it doesn&#x27;t, even if you do it in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was too good to be true, but I bought it anyway and returned it quickly.</li>
    <li> Within 5 minutes after installing batteries, the handle of the brush became way too hot...even with the switch in the OFF position. Batteries were incredibly hot to remove. I verified the expiration date was still valid, however replaced with a new set of batteries (different brand this time) just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just the first set that was the problem. Same thing happened with the second set of batteries!  Within minutes, the batteries got so hot, I was afraid to leave them in the brush. I will be returning this as soon as possible for refund, as I don&#x27;t feel it is a safe product to leave unattended.</li>
    <li> When you use it you turn it ON pushing a moving piece that without you noticing slips back and then it is OFF. Concentrating in keeping it ON I tried it but did not see any visible result on my hair. Is it working? I don&#x27;t know, the battery is working cause the led is ON, no sound comes of it, so I don&#x27;t know. There is no specification in the box indicating what you may see after using it or else, I am disapointed because I thought it would be great.</li>
    <li> This comb was a used one. Even then I sanitized it and put on battery. It make weird noise and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Maybe the free replacement that I get tomorrow will be a better on.</li>
    <li> I have to confess that I purchased my brush on ebay rather than amazon (best available price) - but the product has such mixed reviews that I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay top dollar. As a result I had very low expectations - not helped by the fact that the seller had failed to remove the half price discount sticker prior to mailing it! However, I have to say that it definitely does reduce static in my fine, thin, flyaway hair, as a result of which I see a definite improvement when I use it. It&#x27;s not dramatic, but it&#x27;s not my imagination either. It may not work on every hair type, but I would recommend it for thin frizzy hair types (me!). I was happy enough with the results that I purchased a second discount John Frieda ionic brush from the same seller.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t make any difference in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just like a regular hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;I used as directed. Would not recommend;&lt;br /&gt; especially for the price. Will return for refund</li>
    <li> This brush uses batteries to create an ionic effect, but nothing happens when I put batteries in it and turn it on. Dead.</li>
    <li> A friend bought a $99.00 ionic brush and I tried it and loved it. So I go on amazon and found the john frieda brush much much cheaper and I love it! I have long thick hair and it makes it so shinny and really helps with frizz.</li>
    <li> I found this brush at kmart and was intruiged by the concept.  I have heavily processed hair and my stylist recommends rinsing my hair with cold water before getting out of the shower to close up and seal the cuticle, which, in addition to making smoothing out the individual strands, helps protect it from styling damage.  In the winter that is very uncomfortable and this brush seemed to provide an alternative to freeezing myself.  For those of you that think that the brush doesn&#x27;t work, consider that it is not always going to be a visible or tangible result...it&#x27;s ionic, working on a Molecular level!  If you need proof that the brush works, use it on a windy day, or on flyaway thin hair (such as my daughter&#x27;s) it noticably reduces the effects of static, especially on thinner hair.  But as far as the ions preventing styling damage, you can&#x27;t see something being prevented, (think about it).  I have had this brush for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  My one complaint is that the on/off switch doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; so that it easily switches modes.  It can slip and turn off while you are using it, or turn on while you are not.  This means you have to check it periodically while brushing your hair and store it in such a way that the switch can&#x27;t be bumped.  Or do as I do and use rechargable batteries so that it doesn&#x27;t matter if it gets turned on and runs the batteries out.  Otherwise the batteries last a long time.  And if it gets switched off while using it...is it that big of a deal to re run it through your hair a few times?  I paid $25 a few years ago and I still think it is a good deal.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it does the job and the only comparable one I found on amazon is $50.  If the ionic tech helps at all, you are going to brush your hair anyway, why not help it at the same time?</li>
    <li> It works! My hair is less frizzy, looks like I just came from the salon. I have added a photo here for those who are asking the battery size (AAA) and whether the base is detachable or not (I can&#x27;t detach it). Hope this helps.</li>
