      <li>So nice to use for make up removal and avoid staining wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Wipes are amazing, effective and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love these!  </li>
      <li>Better than messing up washclothes and keeps recycled germs off your face.</li>
      <li>SURE</li>
      <li>I have bought many over the years.</li>
      <li>I love these towelettes.  </li>
      <li>I love the convenience of these towelettes.  </li>
      <li>These are the most economic, effective make-up removing wipes!</li>
      <li>Love this product and so happy to find it in multiple packs</li>
      <li>gentle effective and save you from getting makeup stains on your was cloths</li>
      <li>It is easy, has a clean scent (no annoying florals or perfumes) and really does clean as advertised, even better.  </li>
      <li>Now, it&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>They are soft and able to take off mascara and eyeliner easily.</li>
      <li>I have used many facial makeup remover cloths and this works the best hands down!  </li>
      <li>Have repurchased several times on Amazon - love these!</li>
      <li>My favorite makeup remover by far.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Great for intimate areas, minus any irritation.</li>
      <li>I am an avid cleaner of my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend and my brother use them after sports to feel fresh until they get a chance to get home and shower and despite the fact that they are meant for the face, I found that they work really well in cleaning stains off of clothing and dirt off of shoes.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without these great little sheets.</li>
      <li>The thing I love about this cleansing towelettes is that it does not leave my skin dry.</li>
      <li>right now for my growing body to hopefully help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy!), and she lied - for me and my waterproof mascara &amp; eyeliner and Bare Minerals foundation, these are the way to go!</li>
      <li>They are ready to use and no rinsing is required.  </li>
      <li>However, I live in hot, humid Houston and makeup needs to be waterproof to not melt or sweat off my face.</li>
      <li>I believe in a deep clean for my skin to keep the blemishes away, so</li>
      <li>With the second I get a clean face.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased at a regular drugstore for a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll see and say that are pretty, friggin&#x27; terrific!</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s because they are helping clear pores</li>
      <li>My skin is relatively sensitive and they are non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>I keep these in my car, handbags, and bathrooms;  a must have to keep moisture in the skin and the adult usage away from baby wipes.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and found too drying.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea</li>
      <li>They clean your face thoroughly without being harsh on your skin.</li>
      <li>Better than any other wipes I have tried, and shoe cleaning wipes are often very expensive, but these work amazingly.</li>
      <li>But in a pinch 2 wipes and I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ve removed at least 95% of the makeup and daily debris.</li>
      <li>The solution on the towelettes is good, but that doesn&#x27;t matter when the entire pack dries out due to poor design.</li>
      <li>There is no excuse not get the makeup, dirt or daily oil off.  </li>

<li> and I have only had 2 random small blemishes in 8 weeks now.  </li>
<li> Helps prevent breakouts and removes even that difficult mascara in a single wipe.</li>
<li> I keep these around and they remove everything (even waterproof) without irritating my eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I keep these in my car, handbags, and bathrooms;  a must have to keep moisture in the skin and the adult usage away from baby wipes. They cleanse without fragrance and leave a radiant glow.  Great for intimate areas, minus any irritation.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and found too drying.</li>
    <li> Helps prevent breakouts and removes even that difficult mascara in a single wipe.</li>
    <li> Good quantity in bulk! Well worth the cost. Sometimes I breakout after using these but I think it&#x27;s because they are helping clear pores and it disturbs the peace a bit for a while until your face gets used to them.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing my Fiance uses to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> So nice to use for make up removal and avoid staining wash cloth.  Still use cleanser after and works great.</li>
    <li> These are the most economic, effective make-up removing wipes! They are odorless, and one wipe can remove all your make-up, including waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> irritated my eyes after a while but removed my make-up</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know, now you do. Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Wipes are amazing, effective and easy to use.  One of my Daughters introduce me to this product and have been using them ever since.  At this Seller&#x27;s price point, why not try them for yourself... You&#x27;ll see and say that are pretty, friggin&#x27; terrific!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price too!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these!  I have used many facial makeup remover cloths and this works the best hands down!  I don&#x27;t wear foundation but I like a lot of mascara, eyeliner and shadow and even use a waterproof eyebrow liquid liner and with one cloth - it&#x27;s all gone. With the second I get a clean face.  Now, it&#x27;s true I believe in a deep clean for my skin to keep the blemishes away, so when I&#x27;m home I wash my face again with DHC&#x27;s Olive Oil Wash (which is a Godsend in itself)! But in a pinch 2 wipes and I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ve removed at least 95% of the makeup and daily debris.</li>
    <li> These remove everything-even my daughters waterproof double layer mascara! and Amazon had best price i have found!</li>
    <li> They are soft and able to take off mascara and eyeliner easily. I have been using these for years.</li>
    <li> Always love these! I keep these around and they remove everything (even waterproof) without irritating my eyes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on generic towelettes.  These are the best.  I have bought many over the years.</li>
    <li> These remove all my makeup and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. Can sting the eyes a little, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THE PACK WITH FIVE OF THEM IN IT  - OR WHATEVER THE BULK ONE HAS - I THINK THE OTHER THE ONLY MAKE UP REMOVER THAT ACTUALLY TAKES IT ALL OFF.LOVE IT ANOTHER MUST HAVE AT MY HOUSE CHEZ COCO! MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH JUST IN CASE.</li>
    <li> Love this product and so happy to find it in multiple packs</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery!</li>
    <li> gentle effective and save you from getting makeup stains on your was cloths</li>
    <li> Better than messing up washclothes and keeps recycled germs off your face.</li>

    <li> My favorite makeup remover by far. Helps me clean off makeup when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face when I get home. The thing I love about this cleansing towelettes is that it does not leave my skin dry.</li>
    <li> This is the only towelette I&#x27;ve had that takes off ALL the makeup, won&#x27;t leave residue, and leaves the skin moisturized. For a lazy person like me it&#x27;s the perfect solution!</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of these towelettes.  They are ready to use and no rinsing is required.  My skin is relatively sensitive and they are non-irritating.  However, the package needs to be stored in a plastic container, zip lock bag, etc. or the towelettes will dry out.</li>
    <li> The best to clean off makeup! Good price!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes! I generally use them to wipe off makeup when I am too tired to wash my face late at night.

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on this makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t work well at all you&#x27;ll end up rubbing your eyes raw to get the makeup off.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  I first purchased at a regular drugstore for a much higher price.  I am an avid cleaner of my face and neck.  These truly are the BEST first step to getting that makeup off.  We have these everywhere in the house.  One in each bathroom, one by the bed, the TV room, my child&#x27;s room and even in the gym bag.  There is no excuse not get the makeup, dirt or daily oil off.  It is easy, has a clean scent (no annoying florals or perfumes) and really does clean as advertised, even better.  I never worry about deep cleaning each day like I used to as long as I use these once a day.  Follow up with a sonic cleanser and good liquid cleansers is in our routine, but it has been reduced to twice a week now that we use these.  I was acne prone and I have only had 2 random small blemishes in 8 weeks now.  Hope it works as well for you.</li>
    <li> these are great. take off foundation, mascara, eyeliner and red lipstick. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Only makeup remover good enough to take off waterproof makeup without irritating my sensitive skin or leaving annoying residue. Have used these for years.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist actually recommended these makeup remover towelettes to me, as they are the ones she uses to remove her waterproof makeup at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve always been concerned about debris getting into my eye, since I am a contact lens wearer, and I never have a problem with these. They&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes.  Removes all my makeup...even the waterproof eye makeup...and leaves my skin feeling moist.  I couldn&#x27;t live without these great little sheets.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. They clean your face thoroughly without being harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> Have repurchased several times on Amazon - love these! I am usually quite holistic, using all-natural when possible. However, I live in hot, humid Houston and makeup needs to be waterproof to not melt or sweat off my face. I have sworn by these for years and years! I do recommend getting one pack in the blue storage box to help prevent dry-out. But after that, the refills are all you need. I even travel with these, just putting them into a Ziploc baggie. They are especially good for waterproof mascara. My friend tried to convince me that organic coconut oil would work just as well - and I had some since I use it for nighttime facial moisturizer (and right now for my growing body to hopefully help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy!), and she lied - for me and my waterproof mascara &amp; eyeliner and Bare Minerals foundation, these are the way to go!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> These wipes work perfectly for removing my eye makeup without any irritation.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea and I will say that I would not recommend using this for cleaning your face as it has caused my skin a little irritation.</li>
