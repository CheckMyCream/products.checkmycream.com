      <li>It fits kid&#x27;s hand and my hand securely.</li>
      <li>Mornings  were always filled with tears.  </li>
      <li>only way to fly.  </li>
      <li>They enjoy keeping their hair neat now.</li>
      <li>but it gets the knots out of my toddler&#x27;s curly hair so easily and quickly.</li>
      <li>but it was full size.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They do actually brush their hair on their own.  </li>
      <li>With the Knot Genie, the crying and screaming stopped and bath time became pleasant again.</li>
      <li>- the brush consistently slips out of my hand when I&#x27;m brushing my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
      <li>This was so much better than a regular hairbrush !</li>
      <li>Incredible - no pulling on wet or dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Worked great on wet or dry hair.</li>
      <li>It used to take me forever to get them ask combed out, now it is much softer and silkier in minutes.</li>
      <li>It really helps!&lt;br /&gt;I am using it every time after I get this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>The Knot Genie has completely changed bath time.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve mis-placed it a few times, but she&#x27;s excited every time we find it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My 2 year old was constantly screaming when I used a regular brush no matter how gentle I was.  </li>
      <li>you simply put the brush at the top of the head and brush down in one long stroke.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair and it was very each to brush through my dry and damaged bleached hair.</li>

<li> This works really well after bath when the girls hair is wet.  </li>
<li> have spent more money on other brushes over the past years, that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> I tried several styles of brushes even one with soft bristle (which still left her hair tangled) and it didn&#x27;t matter if her hair was wet or dry.  </li>
<li> I bought this brush because I have four granddaughters, each with long hair and a lot of it.  </li>
<li> I have 4 girls with long hair.</li>
<li> only issue we have is that we have to be careful when we use the Knot Genie over my daughter&#x27;s ears.</li>
<li> it really does work for my thick long hair</li>
<li> My little girl has an extremely sensitive head and we struggle to brush her hair daily due to the discomfort it causes her.</li>
<li> The brush is put together rather cheaply in my opinion,  but the price isn&#x27;t bad and it does get the job done for my 2.5 year old baby girl!</li>
<li> I tried using the brush on wet and dry hair, even using detangling spray.  </li>
<li> It helps to silence the &#x27;ouchies&#x27;, when it comes to wet or dry tangles.</li>
<li> The Detangle is a must, especially for little girl curls.</li>
<li> Their hair varies from very thick and curly to straight.  </li>
<li> Bath time used to involve screaming and crying whenever we used a standard comb to comb my daughter&#x27;s wavy hair.  </li>
<li> The Knot Genie scratches her ears, which she understandably does not like, but you just have to be careful to keep the Knot Genie away from ears.</li>
<li> This worked really well on long, thick curly hair!!</li>
<li> But there is minimal screaming while that happens!  </li>
<li> I have not used it on any other type of hair.  </li>
<li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with really thick hair as I doubt it would work for that.</li>
<li> She still yells when I&#x27;m brushing, whether I do it from the scalp down or not.  </li>
<li> My hair is detangled in less than 5 minutes.</li>
<li> less tangles.  </li>
<li> If the hair has lots of knots it seems to take a little longer than a typical brush to get them out.  </li>
<li> These bristles scratch their little heads.</li>
<li> When I try to use it on their dry hair however, the amount of static it produces is insane.</li>
<li> it gets misplaced or at grandma&#x27;s house.</li>
<li> One is very thin but curly the other is extremely think and long.  </li>
<li> No more &amp;#34;Ow&#x27;s&amp;#34; from my little angel.  </li>
<li> No more pulling hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not magic</li>
<li> In fact, all the broken hairs that would stick up around my head &amp; need to be smoothed down, are now growing out.  </li>
<li> You hardly feel any tangles and their hair is combed in a cinch.  </li>
<li> This product made matters worse.</li>
<li> It did not make it any easier, if anything, it made it worse.</li>
<li> Very disappointed, product info is completely misleading, does nothing it claims.</li>
<li> Very painful, even at the softest touch, very hard plastic, stabbing like bristles.</li>
<li> They hate it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use the detangle brush I ordered every day sometimes several times a day it really does work for my thick long hair</li>
    <li> This brush really surprised me. I can&#x27;t believe this actually works. I have long hair and it tangles easily and this brush did the job of detangling without hurting.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this brush to any parent who has a child with fine hair that tangles.&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter loves this brush and it makes getting the snarls out much easier.  She likes the color and the style - it fits nicely in her hand when she brushes it.  Now all we need to do is not mis-place the brush!  Our daughter loves to walk around the house brushing her hair with it.  We&#x27;ve mis-placed it a few times, but she&#x27;s excited every time we find it.&lt;br /&gt;I have spent more money on other brushes over the past years, that didn&#x27;t work.  This one does work.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I have four granddaughters, each with long hair and a lot of it.  I tried using the brush on wet and dry hair, even using detangling spray.  It did not make it any easier, if anything, it made it worse.</li>
    <li> After I bleached my hair, I could not brush through it at all. Until I bought this brush! It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair and it was very each to brush through my dry and damaged bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! My hair reaches my upper thigh and I have a lot of hair to detangle. This does the trick!</li>
    <li> This works really well after bath when the girls hair is wet.  You hardly feel any tangles and their hair is combed in a cinch.  When I try to use it on their dry hair however, the amount of static it produces is insane.</li>
    <li> I bought my four granddaughters each one of these brushs.  They all loved them.  Their hair varies from very thick and curly to straight.  The brush works great for all.  They enjoy keeping their hair neat now.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a recommendation from a friend.  Has worked wonders for the complaints my daughter would make when we&#x27;d brush her hair.</li>
    <li> The Knot Genie has completely changed bath time. Bath time used to involve screaming and crying whenever we used a standard comb to comb my daughter&#x27;s wavy hair.  With the Knot Genie, the crying and screaming stopped and bath time became pleasant again. It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue we have is that we have to be careful when we use the Knot Genie over my daughter&#x27;s ears. The Knot Genie scratches her ears, which she understandably does not like, but you just have to be careful to keep the Knot Genie away from ears. That&#x27;s pretty easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.  Get it. You&#x27;ll really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Works great!! My hair is detangled in less than 5 minutes. I recommend it for everyone with difficulties to brush their hairs.</li>
    <li> It really helps!&lt;br /&gt;I am using it every time after I get this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> For the most part the brush works great. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with really thick hair as I doubt it would work for that. The brush is put together rather cheaply in my opinion,  but the price isn&#x27;t bad and it does get the job done for my 2.5 year old baby girl!</li>
    <li> I got this for my tender-headed daughter and it&#x27;s just O.K.  She still yells when I&#x27;m brushing, whether I do it from the scalp down or not.  It still pulls just like the other brushes we own, but this one is harder to hold.  I wish I knew why there are so many fantastic reviews on this...</li>
    <li> This worked really well on long, thick curly hair!! I would recommend it again ! This was so much better than a regular hairbrush !</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  My 2 year old was constantly screaming when I used a regular brush no matter how gentle I was.  I tried several styles of brushes even one with soft bristle (which still left her hair tangled) and it didn&#x27;t matter if her hair was wet or dry.  So glad I found this.  I read a review on here that helped with technique- you simply put the brush at the top of the head and brush down in one long stroke.  No more &amp;#34;Ow&#x27;s&amp;#34; from my little angel.  My toddler has long, straight, fine hair but she does have a lot of it.  I tried it on my hair which is the same and I loved it for me.  I have not used it on any other type of hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing close to it&#x27;s claims. My little girl has an extremely sensitive head and we struggle to brush her hair daily due to the discomfort it causes her. This product made matters worse. Very painful, even at the softest touch, very hard plastic, stabbing like bristles. I may never get her to try something else. Very disappointed, product info is completely misleading, does nothing it claims.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased this that it was a smaller size.  It is the perfect size for my 3 year old&#x27;s hands.  She likes to use it and therefore is brushing her hair more often &#x3D; less tangles.  If the hair has lots of knots it seems to take a little longer than a typical brush to get them out.  But there is minimal screaming while that happens!  Overall I think it is well worth the purchase for my kids.  Have not tried it on my hair.</li>
    <li> OMG.  only way to fly.  toddler only accepts this brush</li>
    <li> This making combing our two year old daughter&#x27;s hair SO MUCH easier.  One of the best purchases I have made in a while!</li>
    <li> Hurts my girls when I tried to brush their hair. Maybe meant more for shorter and thinner hair. The one I get from ULTRA detangler works much better. Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not magic but no screams, shrieks, whines or even complaints.  It fits kid&#x27;s hand and my hand securely.</li>
    <li> Excellent for children with tangled hair. My 6 year grandson loves it. No more pulling hair.</li>
    <li> Omg!  This brush is awesome! My girls have totally different types of hair.  One is very thin but curly the other is extremely think and long.  Mornings  were always filled with tears.  Not anymore.  They do actually brush their hair on their own.  They are 7 and 4 and can use this brush.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Worked great on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> The Detangle is a must, especially for little girl curls. It helps to silence the &#x27;ouchies&#x27;, when it comes to wet or dry tangles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes this brush so amazing but it gets the knots out of my toddler&#x27;s curly hair so easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> My kiddos have fine curly hair. These bristles scratch their little heads. They hate it.</li>
    <li> This brush has been working great at brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It is painfree which is especially great for my youngest who seems to have the world&#x27;s most sensitive scalp/head!  I only wish it had a handle - the brush consistently slips out of my hand when I&#x27;m brushing my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> This product works!  Thank you!  It is very simple to use and my girl loves it.  Buy one and your girls won&#x27;t cry any more.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.  I&#x27;d bought one for my daughter and actually got her to brush her hair without screaming.  I had to have one for myself.  I was expecting the mini for the price but it was full size.  Incredible - no pulling on wet or dry hair.  In fact, all the broken hairs that would stick up around my head &amp; need to be smoothed down, are now growing out.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and doesn&#x27;t damage hair!</li>
    <li> this product came to me with hair in it. YUCK! I returned it.</li>
    <li> It feels like this brush has needle points. Used it once, never again</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase ever! I have 4 girls with long hair. It used to take me forever to get them ask combed out, now it is much softer and silkier in minutes. Thinking of getting more to have in case it gets misplaced or at grandma&#x27;s house.</li>
