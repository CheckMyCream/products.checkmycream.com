### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>The price is wonderful - not an arm and a leg.  </li>
      <li>the smell was so wonderful</li>
      <li>, it lathered well, IT SMELLED GREAT!!</li>
      <li>I should also note that my hair although it has been bleached &amp; dyed is in great condition.</li>
      <li>This works great for me.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, great price</li>
      <li>It did smell great, but what&#x27;s a great smelling shampoo if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>this line of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s smell great</li>
      <li>Switching to Gud was a great decision.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use non-natural shampoos anymore, so I&#x27;m glad Burt&#x27;s Bees is making yet another great smelling shampoo!</li>
      <li>:P</li>
      <li>Love this product; it smells incredible in my kids&#x27; hair.  </li>
      <li>having been said, it&#x27;s a good shampoo that cleans my hair.</li>
      <li>but It doesn&#x27;t really do a good job cleaning your hair.</li>
      <li>And we love it!</li>
      <li>I know a Shampoo&#x27;s number one function is not to drastically moisturize but still...it could have been better!</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo;  use a little and get great results; the scent is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Also, the service was great - it came quickly in the mail.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is pretty great.</li>
      <li>shampoo does have a very light vanilla scent.</li>
      <li>love the smell and how it makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love it, it smelled great</li>
      <li>The conditioner wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
      <li>I have used so many mens shampoos from Suave to Gud.</li>
      <li>Smells great and gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>This takes some getting used to, and I&#x27;ll admit that a lot more has &amp;#34;run off&amp;#34; of my hand while I&#x27;m shutting the bottle than I&#x27;d like to see.</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells</li>
      <li>really enjoyed the conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but not this one.</li>
      <li>It gets my hair nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>It has a great smell, makes my hair silky and soft!</li>
      <li>After one wash and rinse with this product my hair was squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>The scent was too strong and stayed in my hair all night.</li>
      <li>First Burt&#x27;s Bees product I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
      <li>Affordable and fantastic for hair growth.</li>
      <li>Upon opening it for the first time the smell is wonderful, however after using it, just like other reviewers said, it just doesn&#x27;t suds up:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not for sure how a natural shampoo can have so many chemicals in it?</li>
      <li>Using this shampoo paired with the Acure Organics Conditioner (argan oil), my hair is clean, shiny and full of body.</li>
      <li>annoys me the most, though, is the very water-y consistency.</li>
      <li>I really, really think this stuff smells phenomenal.</li>
      <li>Love my Bert&#x27;s lip balm, this shampoo not so much.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo my fiancee bought, she she&#x27;s it smell great, but doesn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling clean like other shampoos do.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed trying this new shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell but not good cleaning wise.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, but if you are looking for a traditional vanilla scent this is not it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That having been said, the most &amp;#34;concerning&amp;#34; ingredient that Skin Deep identifies is the Fragrance.</li>
      <li>Really recommend this shampoo!</li>
      <li>And of course, really fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Bought for its vanilla scent on a whim and won&#x27;t be coming back to buy more.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find an all natural shampoo</li>
      <li>now such that I don&#x27;t need the conditioner anymore, because it combs easily.  </li>
      <li>, I may be rebuying this one again (and I really like switching bath and body products up every time they run out</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it added much softness to my hair like the Conditioner</li>
      <li>The smell is really intense and stayed with me for about two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>as many other mainstream shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have become allergic to many other hair products on the market.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good shampoo - especially for being a little more natural than some of the other shampoos out there.</li>
      <li>1st off, this is a decent shampoo.</li>
      <li>This particular flavor seems to have no effect on him.</li>
      <li>I bought this &#x27;on a whim&#x27; as a substitute for my regular shampoo, but discovered this one is better than my regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>also highly recommend the vanilla flame body splash.</li>
      <li>Gud doesn&#x27;t have that heavy creamy feeling like so many shampoos that try to be both shampoo and conditioner simultaneously.</li>
      <li>My fine, slightly-wavy hair is short enough (chin length)</li>
      <li>so this is a pretty big deal for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The ingredient concerns are most allergy/sensitivity-focused ingredients, but there&#x27;s still a low concern for cancer and other health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I spent the next 10 to 20 minutes in the shower with a deep conditioner and was able to reverse some of the damage.</li>
      <li>( I didn&#x27;t purchase because of the natural attribute, just the smell.</li>
      <li>Please, however, be aware that this is not nearly as &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; as the organic/natural label may lead you to believe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a natural product</li>
      <li>The super wateriness of it also makes for a handful everytime you try to squeeze a little.</li>
      <li>I can smell it in the shower, and I can very barely smell it as my hair is drying.</li>
      <li>The cheap Suave shampoo works better than this crap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have thick, straight hair that can sometimes be frizzy and dull. Using this shampoo paired with the Acure Organics Conditioner (argan oil), my hair is clean, shiny and full of body. In the past, I&#x27;ve used drug store shampoos like Suave and Pantene Pro-V, but they always left my hair sticky with a residue. Switching to Gud was a great decision.</li>
    <li> The price is wonderful - not an arm and a leg.  It&#x27;s also a natural product and I have become allergic to many other hair products on the market.  This works great for me.  Also, the service was great - it came quickly in the mail.  So, a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good shampoo - especially for being a little more natural than some of the other shampoos out there. Please, however, be aware that this is not nearly as &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; as the organic/natural label may lead you to believe. According to the Skin Deep Database, this has a warning level of 5 out of 10 - which is the same concern level of other mainstream shampoos such as Suave or Pantene. Do not think you&#x27;re getting a &amp;#34;safe and pure&amp;#34; product. You&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That having been said, the most &amp;#34;concerning&amp;#34; ingredient that Skin Deep identifies is the Fragrance. It also mentions that the SD Alcohol 1, Lactic Acid, and Potassium Sorbate are a concern. The ingredient concerns are most allergy/sensitivity-focused ingredients, but there&#x27;s still a low concern for cancer and other health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does have a very light vanilla scent. I can smell it in the shower, and I can very barely smell it as my hair is drying. After my hair is dry, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore. The shampoo does lather a bit, but it&#x27;s not nearly the same amount of lather as many other mainstream shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What annoys me the most, though, is the very water-y consistency. I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo that actually, literally, comes out almost entirely like water. It doesn&#x27;t have any gel-like consistency to it at all. This takes some getting used to, and I&#x27;ll admit that a lot more has &amp;#34;run off&amp;#34; of my hand while I&#x27;m shutting the bottle than I&#x27;d like to see. The watery consistency doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any benefit, so I&#x27;m curious why it&#x27;s like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That having been said, it&#x27;s a good shampoo that cleans my hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem too rough to use every day, and I like the smell and shampoo/conditioner set. However, do not think that you&#x27;re automatically getting a safer product. Unfortunately, you&#x27;re not.</li>
    <li> love the smell and how it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Smells great, great price</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty great. I just finished up the entire bottle and the smell was so wonderful, I may be rebuying this one again (and I really like switching bath and body products up every time they run out so this is a pretty big deal for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the conditioner as well. I still have about 40% of the conditioner left because I only had to use a small amount of it every time I washed my hair. The smell is really intense and stayed with me for about two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend the vanilla flame body splash. Amazing! And I&#x27;m really not too crazy about anything too vanilla.</li>
    <li> Love my Bert&#x27;s lip balm, this shampoo not so much.  Bought for its vanilla scent on a whim and won&#x27;t be coming back to buy more.  YMMV but for my oily hair it just isn&#x27;t cutting it.  The super wateriness of it also makes for a handful everytime you try to squeeze a little.</li>
    <li> this line of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s smell great but It doesn&#x27;t really do a good job cleaning your hair. I think it caused a lot of hair to fall out as well. needless to say I will not be buying this product.</li>
    <li> First Burt&#x27;s Bees product I haven&#x27;t liked. It does not lather, and does not smell like vanilla. Used with the conditioner - it leaves my hair sticky, weighed down, and hard to manage. I&#x27;m throwing it away, please save your money.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband use this shampoo everyday! And we love it! It has a great smell, makes my hair silky and soft! Really recommend this shampoo! And of course, really fast shipping! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like a million angels are blowing kisses on your hair. Seriously, this stuff is the bomb.</li>
    <li> I have used so many mens shampoos from Suave to Gud. I was looking for an all natural one that wasn&#x27;t expensive as I&#x27;ve bought John Masters and it was expensive about $20 and when I saw Gud and saw the price I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I love(d) all things Burt&#x27;s Bess, until this shampoo. I really wanted to love it, it smelled great, it lathered well, IT SMELLED GREAT!! The positives ended there, it left my hair feeling dry, yet coated &amp; sticky. The next day it was an unmanageable oil slick. I tried the shampoo alone without conditioner then again with several different brands and all had the same results. I ended up using it to shave with. :P *I should also note that my hair although it has been bleached &amp; dyed is in great condition.*</li>
    <li> I enjoyed trying this new shampoo.  However, I did find it a few days later at my local grocery store for $5.00 less than I paid on line.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find an all natural shampoo but after a few uses, it leaves hair heavy and weighed down with residue. My hair sometimes looked like I didnt even wash it. Nice smell but not good cleaning wise.</li>
    <li> I really, really think this stuff smells phenomenal. Especially the Conditioner! But the Shampoo just did not perform as expected. It didn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing and I don&#x27;t feel like it added much softness to my hair like the Conditioner did. If anything, find a different Shampoo and just buy the Conditioner. I know a Shampoo&#x27;s number one function is not to drastically moisturize but still...it could have been better!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo;  use a little and get great results; the scent is wonderful.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make larger bottles.</li>
    <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but not this one. I have really thin but curly hair and I finally managed to grow it out. I made the mistake of trying this shampoo and it damaged my hair after one use! Yes one use! I could feel it drying out my hair as soon as I put it on. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t much better. My hair was tangled after using a generous amount trying to fix the damage from the shampoo. I spent the next 10 to 20 minutes in the shower with a deep conditioner and was able to reverse some of the damage. The scent was too strong and stayed in my hair all night. I smelled like vanilla vodka. It was disgusting! I got rid of it the next day. This has to be the worst natural product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not for sure how a natural shampoo can have so many chemicals in it? Upon opening it for the first time the smell is wonderful, however after using it, just like other reviewers said, it just doesn&#x27;t suds up:( I didn&#x27;t purchase because of the natural attribute, just the smell. It did smell great, but what&#x27;s a great smelling shampoo if it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll continue to stick with their lip balm, but leaving this bottle for the dog.</li>
    <li> Both this product AND the conditioner I ordered arrived with the lids unscrewed. They both spilled into the shipping box. I have no idea why / how that would happen. I assume someone had to have unscrewed them by hand or perhaps the lids are not well made and they come off in transit. In any case, I&#x27;m obviously not very happy about it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and I look forward to opening the bottle every morning.  It gets my hair nice and clean.  My fine, slightly-wavy hair is short enough (chin length) now such that I don&#x27;t need the conditioner anymore, because it combs easily.  I won&#x27;t use non-natural shampoos anymore, so I&#x27;m glad Burt&#x27;s Bees is making yet another great smelling shampoo!</li>
    <li> Affordable and fantastic for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Love this product; it smells incredible in my kids&#x27; hair.  I get the vanilla one and have had no problems with it, and my son has eczema which is often worsened by citrus products.  This particular flavor seems to have no effect on him.</li>
    <li> I got this despite the other bad reviews thinking I would give it a chance. Big mistake. After a few weeks of use, it has left my hair dry and frizzy. I have easy to maintain, wavy/curly hair and this shampoo has left my hair looking AND feeling horrible. It also has a weird smell, no lather, and the conditioner hardly works. I&#x27;m left with tangles in my hair after every wash. Stay away. The cheap Suave shampoo works better than this crap.</li>
    <li> This shampoo my fiancee bought, she she&#x27;s it smell great, but doesn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling clean like other shampoos do.</li>
    <li> 1st off, this is a decent shampoo. But like others have mentioned it does not smell like vanilla. The scent is nice, but if you are looking for a traditional vanilla scent this is not it.</li>
    <li> I bought this &#x27;on a whim&#x27; as a substitute for my regular shampoo, but discovered this one is better than my regular shampoo. Gud doesn&#x27;t have that heavy creamy feeling like so many shampoos that try to be both shampoo and conditioner simultaneously. After one wash and rinse with this product my hair was squeaky clean! Excellent product. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
