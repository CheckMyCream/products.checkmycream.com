      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This also is quite creamy and smells really great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff....just don&#x27;t put dye on your hair until you have used a shampoo for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>Great deal for 3 of these.</li>
      <li>, mine has a lot of silver highlights, lol.  </li>
      <li>My hair, however, looks and feels great now.</li>
      <li>Great product, cheaper at Sally Beauty Supply though.</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>I love this cowash for my 4c hair and finding it in a discounted 3 pack on Amazon was a great find!!</li>
      <li>I also love the coconut smell!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>I  have very fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
      <li>Recommended by my hair stylist, I first gave this a try and found out that it is perfect for &#x27;no shed hair conditioning&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Since it also has a mild cleaner in it</li>
      <li>This is not only the best hair cleansing product for natural hair but also the BEST detangler I have ever purchased!  </li>
      <li>the items came quick and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>After many trials, this one fits the bill.</li>
      <li>but i am not in like or in love with Cowash.</li>
      <li>I feel it is ok</li>
      <li>I need more moisture based products.</li>
      <li>This product may be okay for others</li>
      <li>I love this co-wash</li>
      <li>Ever since I noticed that most of the hair falling out during a shower falls at the conditioning stage, I have been looking for a conditioner that minimizes hair loss.</li>
      <li>So glad I discovered this for my hair.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this hair wash and have since bought it for my two grown kids who love it and have continued to use it as well.  </li>
      <li>This product smells a lot like MyHoneyChild&#x27;s products, but they are better value.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>The best curly hair 3b products on the market - only wish they were unscented for those with fragrance allergies.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair perfectly smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>I now have smooth coiling hair</li>
      <li>It gets my scalp clean and reduces itching.</li>
      <li>By the way I am a 60 year old white female.so this produce is good for everyone!!</li>
      <li>Not bad......</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have natural hair that tangle very easily.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t co-washed in a very long time, but I figured I would try this since I had heard good things about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve saved so much money by buying this product!!</li>
      <li>Overall, our hair looks and smells great and is incredibly soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>people recommend using a strong cleanser once in a while to clear away any buildup</li>
      <li>Love this, this is my second purchase and will continue to purchase this product</li>
      <li>This is the only co-wash that I use and I love it.</li>
      <li>We all love this product, but I will say that about once every two weeks you need to use a regular gentle shampoo because this tends to build up in your hair and the root area starts getting pretty greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have waist length hair; I only needed 2-3 palms full of this product to condition my hair!</li>
      <li>I Am leave in conditioner&amp;#34; and finally pure coconut oil to lock in the moisture.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses this.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair that used to behave very well in the humid summers of the east</li>
      <li>Much cheaper and works just as well.</li>
      <li>My daughter has much finer hair, but hers is processed to death and was looking a bit fried on the ends.  </li>
      <li>been using this for quite awhile and really like it.  </li>
      <li>However, you really need to add something with a high-level of moisture to keep the moisture in your hair.  </li>
      <li>- coming from someone that has a cabinet full of detanglers that have fallen short of my expectations.</li>
      <li>This product left my kinky, frizzy hair feeling smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this</li>
      <li>--it is the first time I&#x27;ve actually re-bought a shampoo or conditioner.</li>
      <li>hair is soooooo soft!  </li>
      <li>Smells great, softens and smooths my crazy curly hair.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not natural; I am relaxed and this product works VERY well for my hair!</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and conditioned.</li>
      <li>, I use it alone without a shampoo during frequent shower days.</li>

    <li> Great stuff....just don&#x27;t put dye on your hair until you have used a shampoo for a couple of days. Hair dye does not seem to take as well. My hair, however, looks and feels great now.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works wonderful. My whole family uses this.</li>
    <li> the items came quick and in good condition.  My son loves the product.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
    <li> I have thick,course frizzy hair. I have tried everything to tame the frizz. This is a miracle produced!!! I now have smooth coiling hair and I love it!!! I will be trying other produces from this line. By the way I am a 60 year old white female.so this produce is good for everyone!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this hair wash and have since bought it for my two grown kids who love it and have continued to use it as well.  We also use the leave-in conditioner on our ends.  My son and I have corse, dark, somewhat curly hair, mine has a lot of silver highlights, lol.  My daughter has much finer hair, but hers is processed to death and was looking a bit fried on the ends.  We all love this product, but I will say that about once every two weeks you need to use a regular gentle shampoo because this tends to build up in your hair and the root area starts getting pretty greasy.

    <li> Great deal for 3 of these. Absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that used to behave very well in the humid summers of the east coast.&lt;br /&gt;After moving to dry California, I have had troubles finding the products that would help me maintain my curls. Worse, I have had itchy scalp from drying shampoos. And then comes &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; to the rescue. I use this to cleanse my hair and follow it up with &amp;#34;As I Am leave in conditioner&amp;#34; and finally pure coconut oil to lock in the moisture. Now my curls are back and my scalp is happy.&lt;br /&gt;Some people recommend using a strong cleanser once in a while to clear away any buildup but I only do it once a month or so.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and conditioned. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like it. She&#x27;s got issues with coconut oil. I bought it for me, though and I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve saved so much money by buying this product!! No more cream rinse or shampoo purchases for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use approximately 2 tablesspoons to get through my long, very thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;Only have to wash once now! Don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;cream rinse still in my hair&amp;#34; feel when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soooooo soft!  Love this.&lt;br /&gt;Had 3 bottles shipped to my daughter in California so she can try it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> Best price for the co-wash I could find. I love this co-wash--it is the first time I&#x27;ve actually re-bought a shampoo or conditioner. I am actually white with moderately curly hair, thought this brand is geared to african-american hair.</li>
    <li> Love this, this is my second purchase and will continue to purchase this product</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have natural hair that tangle very easily. This is not only the best hair cleansing product for natural hair but also the BEST detangler I have ever purchased!  - coming from someone that has a cabinet full of detanglers that have fallen short of my expectations.</li>
    <li> The best curly hair 3b products on the market - only wish they were unscented for those with fragrance allergies.</li>
    <li> Great product, cheaper at Sally Beauty Supply though.</li>
    <li> Not bad......I am comparing this to Wen.  Much cheaper and works just as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only co-wash that I use and I love it. It gets my scalp clean and reduces itching. I also love the coconut smell!</li>
    <li> I  have very fine, curly hair.  My hair was thicker and I&#x27;m beginning to realize that I have a lot of breakage. I have a lot of short pieces of hair starting to grow from using this cleansing conditioner.  I also started using coconut oil in my hair a couple of times per week. My husband likes to use this because it saves him time in the morning because he can shampoo and condition at the same time.</li>
    <li> been using this for quite awhile and really like it.  Smells great, softens and smooths my crazy curly hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t co-washed in a very long time, but I figured I would try this since I had heard good things about it. This product smells a lot like MyHoneyChild&#x27;s products, but they are better value. The product you get for the amount you pay is great! I have waist length hair; I only needed 2-3 palms full of this product to condition my hair! I HIGHLY recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I&#x27;m not natural; I am relaxed and this product works VERY well for my hair!</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling brittle</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve noticed how softer this has made my hair.  However, you really need to add something with a high-level of moisture to keep the moisture in your hair.  This also is quite creamy and smells really great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time and as described. So glad I discovered this for my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.  It cleans without stripping the hair of its glow!</li>
    <li> This product may be okay for others but i was not impressed. I bought 3 jars and will be using it till it finishes but i will not buy again. I need more moisture based products. I feel it is ok but i am not in like or in love with Cowash. But it can definitely work for other hair textures. I have very very coarse hair and dry scalp. This product simply cannot keep up...i have to mix it with other products to use it. No, i will not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product left my kinky, frizzy hair feeling smooth and soft. I will definitely purchase this again once my current supply runs out.</li>
    <li> Excellent and makes my 4C hair look and feel amazing!</li>
    <li> The best cowash conditioner that I have ever used! Well buy again!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love it, love it, love it!</li>
</ol>
