<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush feels very comfortable, of which you can feel the support and smooth touch on your face. Love it!</li>
    <li> this is the best brush I have ever used</li>
    <li> You will love this little treat of a brush. It is dense and soft all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply both creamy and mousse type foundation with it. Adore it!</li>
    <li> So I had been eyeing this brush for awhile and read so many amazing reviews on it. I was hesitant at first because it was kind of pricey for a brush. But after doing a lot of research and really seeing how many people loved it, I decided to just go ahead and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST DECISION EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was using the beauty blender and it was okay. I have oily, acne prone skin and need a full-coverage foundation. So that means I also need something to apply it and make it look as natural as possible. The beauty blender would sometimes make the foundation slide off my skin within a couple of hours. It was really setting it well into my pores. So the first time I tried the Sigma round kabuki I saw such a difference and was extremely happy with my purchase. It blended my foundation flawlessly and I am soo happy with this brush. I plan on buying more Sigma brushes because the quality is so amazing.</li>
    <li> In Love!!!! For apply foundation, is the best... The Best ever... love. congratulation sigma for a amazing produto... love love</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great quality item! Would definitely recommend, using this brush revolutionized my foundation routine!</li>
    <li> this brush is a good value for the price.  the bristles are very soft and they don&#x27;t fall out when you are applying your powder.</li>
    <li> This brush is very nice. I use it for powder but I have also tried foundation with it and it applies it perfectly. definitely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I watched a lot of reviews about this brush before I bought it, and it lives up to all the good reviews about it being soft and applying even foundation.  I will never go back to using my fingers to apply foundation!</li>
    <li> i dont usually leave reviews but this brush is amazing! The bristles are so soft and it works better than i had anticipated. it gives you flawless foundation application. i cannot wait to order more brushes. thanks sigma!</li>
    <li> Just tried the sigma kabuki round top brush and i&#x27;m loving it! i&#x27;m so glad i was introduced to it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered F82 and F80 because of their incredible Amazon reviews; however, I must say the reviews were exaggerated - they&#x27;re just okay, not even close to my expectation. It&#x27;s reasonable for an upset customer wonder where those amazing compliments on Sigma Brushes came from; the answer possibly was related to a note in my package - it said that I will get a free gift if I left feedback on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to my old Chanel powder brush, I was disappointed that F80 used 3x more mineral powder, but provided much more poor result. Foundation powder was not evenly on my face and some areas had too thick powder. I asked for refund and then sadly learned that they only accept F82 (new, un-used brush) for return. That is to say, I spent $16 for a one-time trial. In which I realized how wonderful job my Chanel brush did - it gently breezed on your face and makeup was evenly and looked so natural (my friends were confused whether I wore makeup or not)! Chanel does have drawbacks - pricey and it will lose some hairs after 1 year. But I definitely will go back to Chanel - yes, it cost more $ but you will get much better quality!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for this brush to arrive.  I had purchased the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuk brush previously and fell in love with it.  So of course I had to have this one too!!  It just arrived today in the mail, and even though I am not going anywhere today, I am still going to go and put on a full face of makeup just to play with my new brush!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush. This brush is excellent for providing full coverage with compact foundation powder/mineral foundation. I&#x27;ve used other brushes in which the bristles were not as densely packed, and the results were never as good as this. The shape would probably also be useful for applying blush, but I haven&#x27;t tried that as of yet.</li>
    <li> I love most Sigma brushes, but the head of this F82 is just a little small for me.  Great for buffing around my nose and jawline, but not super practical to use on my entire face.  I&#x27;ll stick to my retractable kabuki brushes for my morning makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. its so soft,I use it with my mineral and liquid foundation and I love the outcome.I would recommend this brush to anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush last week and I already used it on a bride to blend her foundation flawlessly. I love love love this brush (even more than i like some of my more expensive brushes) Its a really great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new brush!!!! Blends really great and I luv my new airbrushed look!!! planning on getting F80 and hope Sigma releases new kabuki eye brushes!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had been researching Sigma makeup for a long time and finally decided that I wanted to try. I decided to only get one brush to see if the quality really was what I had heard, and I can&#x27;t believe it. This brush is truly amazing. My foundation has never look so smooth. Thank you sigma and as soon as I have some extra cash I will be buying more of your brushes.</li>
    <li> I would like to say ( THANK YOU ) for this bad Experience !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some important point !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I Find This product in the original site by $18 and here it is $18.83&lt;br /&gt;2- The picture that you put here it&#x27;s not true ! it&#x27;s in the original site !!&lt;br /&gt;3- The product in your picture made in USA But on your product that I bought ( made in CHINA )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought P84 and F82 for my sister and really I am so Embarrassing of her !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave you 1 star and its more of you !</li>
    <li> This brush is great for foundation and concealer application as well. I also have the sigma flat top kabuki brush which is great for buffing liquid and cream foundation.. but I had to have this!  Because of its shape, it does a really good job of getting product around the nose and under the eyes.  It gives a very smooth finish and is very soft! I am a very happy Sigma brushes user!</li>
    <li> This brush works great especially with powder more than foundation. This is my second Sigma brush and I just love these brushes!</li>
    <li> This is brush is good for foundation and powder. My only complaint is that the metal started to peel off the second day I used it. Therefore, I ended up with metal residue on the synthetic hair. Maybe I got a crappy one?</li>
    <li> Blend my foundation well.  Love it...</li>
    <li> This is the first time I buy Sigma brushes and they are great! Not expensive at all and great quality!!! Love this one specially to apply my foundation!</li>
    <li> i was searching for a brush like this but i never found one. finally i found it in amazon and i saw the reviews so i decided to order it. when i got it i immediately use it and it works great. what else can i say i just love this brush works for me great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice affordable brush. I just don&#x27;t understand why it was wrapped in a ziplock bag, when I received it in the mail.</li>
    <li> im really satisfied with this make up brush!the brush has a very good quality and it fells super soft on my skin every morning! i had no problems with the seller and it arrives very quickly at my house  in germany)!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to buy a great synthetic brush sigma brushes are fab! I loved it! it has soft brissless Its perfect for foundation/ or blush! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are amazing quality for the price. But this brush just does not do it for me. It leaves my foundation all streaky and quite messy looking. I just can&#x27;t seem to find a good use for this brush.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. I love it for liquid and mineral foundation as well as blush. It also would work well with contouring. It gets into the creases of the face. It is super soft and washes easily and doesn&#x27;t shed. This is a must have in my collection.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush because it is such a hard job to blend in the foundation near your nose and eyes, this can do the magic. Go for it</li>
    <li> Great price, will never pay for a mac brush ever again!  Loved using this with my Laura Mercier tinted moisterizer for an air brushed look and I use just the right amount of product using it.  Definitely get this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush blends so beautifully without lifting makeup, so the coverage is better than it would be using most other brushes or makeup sponges.</li>
    <li> Just received my new brush and am thrilled with it!  It&#x27;s amazing how much makeup (and MONEY) you can save when it&#x27;s not all absorbed into a sponge. Quality brushes at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I heard the brushes were great so I decided to buy them and I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, they are really good to apply foundation and concealer</li>
    <li> Wow! I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about Sigma Makeup. The whole company is amazing. I will recomend this company to everyone I know. I have bought very expensive brushes from well known companies, and Sigma Makeup is even better! The F82 is my holy-grail brush. I dont know how I have applied makeup before without it!! PLEASE try out Sigma brushes before you buy any other brush or makeup item. They are the best and you will be beyond pleased - like I am!! The company is nice, and responsive. The shipping was so quick! I have never had better service. And the item was packaged nicely. You can really tell this company puts a lot of hard work and effort into their products, and WOW! It certainly does pay off! THANK YOU THANK YOU Sigma!!! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned or used. Before I bought this brush I always bought Mac brushes thinking they were the best. I was so wrong. This brush is soft and applies makeup flawlessly. I fully intend on purchasing more Sigma brushes. Shipping was fast, no issues at all with seller. I looked them up through Sigma before purchasing :)</li>
    <li> When I received this brush, I was so impressed that I had to order more sigma products.  This brush is so soft, and it doesn&#x27;t shed like some other brushes.  It is very well made and a beautiful addition to my brushes.</li>
    <li> Before I had ordered this brush, I was using a traditional foundation brush which didn&#x27;t blend my liquid foundation well and left my face looking cakey. I had heard kabuki brushes were great for applying and blending foundation, so when I saw the F82 brush I went ahead and ordered it. I absolutely love it, it blends my foundation really nicely, to the point where my face looks airbrushed. I love how the bristles are really dense, soft, and firm, making it easy to buff the foundation onto my face. The rounded edges make it easy to apply foundation around my nose, chin, and under my eyes. It also cut the time it takes to apply my foundation in half. It&#x27;s good to use for contouring as well, and applying/blending other face products like concealer, blush, bronzer etc. The price is great as well, I love not having to spend over $30 for a good quality brush. Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Wow,     I am so impressed with the quality of this brush. The bristles are very tightly packed, yet it is as soft as my ecotools brushes. It is perfect with pressed powder, it is also perfect with mineral products, as well as liquids. It is definitely a go to brush for me. It applies cream blush like a dream, and makes my makeup application flawless. I am so glad I purchased this product, the shipping was fast, and arrived well before the estimated date. I highly recommend this brand and this brush to anyone looking for that perfect do everything brush. Thank you Sigma, for designing this amazing brush, it makes all my makeup go on great.</li>
    <li> The Sigma F80 brush is just what I have been looking for! I have switched over from my 187 to this brush now. It does not shed and does an amazing job of applying my foundation! I ordered it on a Tuesday and it was here on Friday :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this makeup brush. For a good price you can get a great foundation brush and use it daily. It has not shed since I have owned it, (for about a month now), and I use it every day. The only con is that I have to wash it each day so the bristles don&#x27;t get clumped together, but you should wash your brushes everyday if using liquid foundation anyways.  GREAT brush, perfect for liquid foundation and even stippling on foundation.  Love it! (and it&#x27;s not 30 bucks like MAC!!! )</li>
    <li> Really love this kabuki brush. Easy to use and easy to clean. You don&#x27;t have to use too much make up on the brush cause it doesn&#x27;t absorb it just easy applies it on to your skin leaving a matte finish!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush a couple of weeks ago...and I love it! The F82 is super soft and it works perfect for creamy consistencies. I&#x27;m using it for my foundation and also for blushes.  I have never tried a Sigma brush before, but I definetly will check out some more.</li>
    <li> The brush is amazing the bristles are really soft!  The rounded top makes applying liquid makeup really easy and flawless.</li>
    <li> I received two Sigma Kabuki brushes for Christmas. I&#x27;ve only used this one for foundation application and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. No shedding, very dense and soft and no brush marks at all. Better than any other high end brushes I&#x27;ve purchased from high end cosmetic counters. I just purchased the powder brush because what I received was so fantastic! Highly recommend this to all!</li>
    <li> I love all sigma brushes holds powder great and blends liquid amazing</li>
    <li> After viewing the new Sigmax collection, I just had to buy this brush. I own the adorable pink travel set of face and eye brushes, and I love them so much and use them every single day. I could never understand why most girls pay more money to buy the MAC brand products when there are cheaper alternatives such as Sigma brand that are in my opinion, much better. I have used this brush for both liquid foundation as well as setting powder, and each look came out absolutely flawless on my less than perfect complexion. The brush hairs are super soft and extremely dense which I LOVE! For $16 I still cannot believe that value.I will definitely be purchasing the other Sigmax brush as soon as possible. I love you Sigma!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the F80, so I decided to give the F82 a chance as well, with no regrets. The round top is absolutely great for under the eyes and around the nose, as described.  Because of this, I use way less under eye concealer than before, and around my nose needs no reapplication during the day.  The brush quickly dried true to shape after washing, and no unraveling took place.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of Sigma Brushes until recently, but I had been stalking the Sephora platinum Airbrush foundation brush[[ASIN:B001QWCBEO SEPHORA COLLECTION Professionnel Platinum Air Brush #55 Professionnel Platinum Air Brush]] for a while, but couldn&#x27;t pull the trigger on it because of the price tag.  So I tried this round top Kabuki instead.        I completely LOVe this brush!  I was not sure if I should get this brush or the flat top Kabuki, I am glad I got this one because it gets in under my eyes as well as a wider application area. Actually this brush now doubles as my foundation AND concealer brush! I used this with my Bobbi Brown concealer[[ASIN:B002VAAIJU Creamy Concealer Kit - Warm Beige - Bobbi Brown - Complexion - Creamy Concealer Kit - -]], AND my coastal Scents camouflage palette[[ASIN:B002QFGQAK Coastal Scents Professional Camouflage Concealer Palette]], and the application under my eye was flawless.  No streaks, no dry globby bits of product stuck in the tiny crinkles under my eyes! (I originally thought about returning the Bobbi Brown concealer because it was kind of chunky and thick when I put it on with my normal concealer brush)      I literally just dab the brush in my concealer pot or pan, and starting in the crook between my nose and my eyes and sweep the brush back and forth under my eye and along the top of my cheekbone.  It works even with my eyes closed, no need for a seperate brush for application and then another for blending.  I used to use a flat synthetic paddle brush to pick up the product and apply it to my face, and then a fluffy eyeshadow brush (MAC 224) to blend it out so it looks natural.  NOT ANYMORE! I have found the best brush for the task and it was like half the price of the brush I was originally thinking about buying.  In the words of one Mr. Charlie Sheen: hello, \\&quot;WINNING!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This brush is so much better than the other brushes I have! It blends so much better so my makeup looks flawless!</li>
    <li> I just got this brush in yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I was blown away by how awesomely awesome this is. Not only did my foundation go on smoothly and flawlessly, but it also cut down my application time as well. When i use a common(name brand even)foundation brush I&#x27;m left looking streaky and even sort of cakey. With a normal brush I&#x27;d usually have to take a damp cloth and moisten my face to get rid of the streaks. With this brush I totally cut that process out. I&#x27;d say with a normal foundation brush it&#x27;d take me about 3 minutes to apply my foundation, with this brush it took me well under 2 minutes, and thats a huge difference when you&#x27;re in a rush, or sometimes dread the over drawn process of it all. After I applied my foundation (mac studio sculpt which is a gel based product), I even noticed that when I cleaned the brush hardly any product came off, as compared to my foundation brush which tons of product would come off. I also used a mineral powder foundation with it, but felt it was too much coverage. SO really, all you need is a good liquid foundation, and maybe a light setting powder and your good too go. With my regular foundation brush I definitely needed extra powder coverage. I think this brush is best used with liquid, and that what i&#x27;ll be using it for mostly, but considering I&#x27;ve only had it for less than 24 hours, I still have a lot of playing around to do.&lt;br /&gt;I think $16 is a very well worth it for this brush. I&#x27;m hoping to soon get the flat top kabuki brush to use with powders.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope some one finds this review helpful!</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush is unbelievable!  It&#x27;s small compared to the Bare Minerals kabuki brush which is what I&#x27;ve been using but i&#x27;m sure in no time I&#x27;ll be used to it.  it applies both powder and liquid foundations so nicely and you get a flawless finish!  It&#x27;s so soft and such nice quality.  I&#x27;m thinking that the sephora airbrush#55 was a poor investment ($45-$55) and I might have to return it and stick with Sigma brushes going forward</li>
    <li> This is the second sigma brush I have purchased and I absolutely love their brushes. I have tons of brushes from Lancome and MAC but the sigmax are my new favourite brushes. I don&#x27;t really use any of my Lancome or Mac brushes anymore. They are twice the price and they are not as good as the sigmax brushes in terms of quality and application.</li>
    <li> Nice powder brush. I highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It applies fondation, powder, and cream blush like a dream. It&#x27;s just so flawless. Best thing to happen to foundation. Will buy the rest of the brushes. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This brush has very soft bristles, I like it very much.  It provides good coverage, is easy to use and feels great on your face.</li>
    <li> This brush is an awesome powder brush, a little small, the reason i gave 4 stars. The brush if very soft, and creates a very nice coverage. Cant go wrong for such a great price. This was my first purchase of sigma brushes, but i will be looking into the other brushes for future purchases. All over a great product and well wroth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good foundation brush for a very long time and they have all been to flimsy of not dense enough. I heard great things about this brush so I thought I would give it a try. It more than exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s so fluffy and dense. It applies liquid foundation so quickly and smoothly. I can&#x27;t imagine doing my makeup without it! It&#x27;s definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> I just got my Sigma brush in the mail today, I have not had a chance to use it yet.  I like the way it looks and it feels really sturdy, I think that it will be a really nice brush!!  I have watched a lot of reviews about it on youtube, so far all of them that I have seen were really good.  People seem to really like this brush, so I thought that I would try one.  I am excited to use it, hopefully I will like it as mush as all my other brushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Came quickly, brushes so soft!!! IN LOVEEEE!!!! Totally would recommend to a friend!!!! :) Do not hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent for buffing in foundation. great with all liquid foundations, and leaves a flawless look on your skin.</li>
    <li> Great brush for applying liquid foundation and blending in. The bristles are very soft, yet dense so not letting the foundation dissapear into the brush instead of your face. Already a favorite!!</li>
    <li> I got my brush in the mail today and I was very excited.  I have used the sigma round kabuki-f82 before so I thought that I would get one of my own.  I think that I will be happy with my new brush!</li>
    <li> This was a great addition to my brush collection. No more cakey foundation over my face. The air brush effect is obtainable with this brush and with the F80 as well.</li>
    <li> I use this for my foundation application. I use this to initially apply and swipe then I use a beauty blender to finish the process. On a normal day I don&#x27;t want thick coverage, but if I do, I have used this for stippling foundation as well and it works very well. I really just use the beauty blender to ensure that it&#x27;s all smoothed and no missed lines of makeup. I have also washed this and it came out very well. No shedding.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its SOOO soft and blends my mineral makeup really well. Loved it so much I offered to buy one for my mom. She really liked what she saw so I ordered one and had it sent to her. She also really, really likes it. I also ordered her a blush brush (Sigma F10) but she didn&#x27;t really care for that one. But we both recommend the F82!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad I didn&#x27;t get this sooner! Makes your foundation perfect and blended! I was deciding between this one and the flat top, and I&#x27;m glad I got this rounded one. I really really love this brush.</li>
    <li> i purchase this brush because i was looking for a good quality foundation brush but didnt want to pay so much. this is the best brush and im not just saying that i honestly think this brush is so good for liquid foundation it leaves my face looking flawless love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE sigma brushes...especially their foundation ones.  I ordered this one for a friend after using it myself for about a year or so.  She said the shipment came super quick, and the brush is absolutely a dream to put foundation on with (we both use Kat Von D which is a very full coverage foundation..  We will both definitely be ordering from sigma again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed that people market their products dishonestly. I have never ordered Sigma brushes before so I would have been a great candidate to scam. However, luckily for me I ordered a brush from Sigma the same time I ordered this brush. Not only does the handle smell like paint.. the logo isn&#x27;t completely printed correctly and the brush head isn&#x27;t a 100% secure. I accidentally noticed this when I pulled it out of it&#x27;s packaging. Also, Sigma has their logo in the metal as well and it&#x27;s very defined. On this brush however... it&#x27;s so faint. Save yourself the hassle. Make sure you order from Sigma themselves or make sure you read all the reviews. To the seller... you should be ashamed of yourself.</li>
    <li> Loved it, much more than the flat kabuki, much smaller this one, but better to use for the foundation. Try it.</li>
    <li> This round kabuki brush is excellently designed and well constructed just as all Sigma brushes are. I own 35 Sigma brushes and I have yet to be disappointed in one of their brushes. This round kabuki is the perfect match to the F80 and F88 kabuki brushes. It&#x27;s a very dense brush that picks up product great and delivers it just where you want it perfectly! It is soo soft but yet very well structured, I find myself just rubbing and rubbing and rubbing because it feels so good on my skin. I have not had one problem with shedding or having brush hairs fall out on my face or anywhere else. I am a forever Sigma fan!!! No other brand can compare to Sigma.</li>
    <li> Super soft, great quality and size. Will be purchasing more sigma brushes! Haven&#x27;t seen any little hairs come out yet, which is a plus. Good price also, will be buying more! :)</li>
    <li> This is a really nice brush.Very substantial!!  Nice inexpensive alternative to Mac brushes! Can&#x27;t beat the price!  I dampen this brush everyday before applying foundation and it never sheds!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever. It&#x27;s small and very dense and soft. I applies foundation beautifully, if you want that very smooth, thing layers that look almost airbrushed. This is small and I do believe there is a large version. Small takes more times but means it works on the nose and around the eyes. It is very dense so foundation blends beautifully. I use it with Laura Mercier Silk Cream Foundation and BB creams and it does an amazing job. The beauty blender is faster and soft on the skin.  This looks even better, as you can really blend.  You can use it for any cream or liquid product. I use it to apply powdered blush sometimes as it&#x27;s small and I like to apply blush on a small area, as I have redness near the nose, so I don&#x27;t want anything pinky even close to that area. So I can bland in small area with this. It is very well made. It feels so soft against the skin yet the very firm. It&#x27;s a super dense brush and fairly stiff.  This is a really well made brush.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this brush, and it absolutely amazing! Its blending power is perfection and it is the perfect shape for getting in those hard to reach areas like under your eyes! The bristles are so freaking soft and it does not shed (BIG WIN).  I definately recommend getting this brush.  Great quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> I for this brush and thought well I guess it&#x27;s soft. I applied my liquid foundation as normal and it went on like normal. I didn&#x27;t think much of it. After about ten minutes when it set I was in love. It was flawless and looked amazing. It Really does give and nice airbrushed finish. I couldn&#x27;t stop staring in the mirror. I so love hat the bristles are shorter and denser than the elf powder brush. It&#x27;s a great brush. If anyone is on the fence, they should buy it!</li>
    <li> It is much smaller than I expected and I thought it would of came in original sigma packaging. It came loose. So I wanted to know if it is genuine sigma</li>
    <li> My new favorite foundation brush! Absolutely love it. I use it to apply my bare minerals foundation and get that airbrushed look.</li>
    <li> My go to brush for applying CC creams and foundation. Love the quality of the brush and the ease of keeping clean and sanitized</li>
    <li> (Faints) I looooooove this brush omg! This brush blends blends blends effortlessly. This brush is no joke. The price is unbelievable. This brush will make you foundation and concealer look like skin PERIOD!</li>
    <li> I love Kabukis. I feel like I don&#x27;t have enough of these babies, though I now own four. Two of my kabukis are big but have really short handles. My Sephora one is comparable to this Sigma one in size and length but is inferior in quality and density of bristles. Although I would have preferred this to be much bigger in bristle girth, this does the job of putting on both pressed and loose powders (mineral and finer textures) quite fabulously and without streaking; it really makes the powder blend into your skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of its handle is perfect because it gives me more control than my short kabukis. The bristles are densely packed yet so soft on skin. I&#x27;d say this tool is a must have for your beauty arsenal. It&#x27;s definitely a quality brush, which after using for five months straight, still looks and feels new. I thought for sure by now that some of the bristles would have fallen out from the constant washings/use. Happy.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this wrong brush for my liquid foundation, but decided to try this for patting out my corrector and concealer.  This worked well and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love almost all of my sigma brushes but this one is my favorite. I use it for exactly what it says its for, mineral powder.</li>
    <li> I know that this one is suppose to be for &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; foundation but I actually do prefer this one to my F80 for cream and liquid foundations as well. Go figure. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong I love the F80 as well but if it&#x27;s clean THIS is my first choice, every single time. I love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to update my brushes without spending alot but wanted Mac quality brushes.  Wow I have been wasting so much product and didn&#x27;t even know it. I just got this brush in and tried it out I useded 1/4 of the normal amount of product and the brush makes a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> This brush is sooooo soft on my skin.  I want to buy more.  It glides and blends beautifully!!  Every Diva needs this brush!</li>
    <li> I think this is better than MAC brush. I love it. It&#x27;s worth the price. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that pricey. Cruelty free. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this quickly and I love it. Purchasing Sigma is hard in the US but I will continue to buy thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this brush almost every day.  I also love the flat top one.  I can never decide which one I love more, so I alternate them.  Every girl needs at least this one or the flat top one for foundation.  I&#x27;ve never found anything better!</li>
    <li> I had been using a beauty blender to apply my make up but saw some youtube gurus using this brush and thought why not try it. OMG I am glad I did! This brush is amazing and I have gotten so many compliments on how flawless my make up looks. I can&#x27;t wait to get the rest of the brushes! Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!  I had researched this item and it was a matter of pricing, shipping and receiving a quality product.  This exceeded my expectations!  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and i am very pleased i bought it. it is a little pricey but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> amazon shipped this brush so fast that i couldn&#x27;t believe it. The dense bristles make it perfect for applying foundation. I may have to order another one right away, I love it that much.</li>
    <li> Everything fine and on time</li>
    <li> LAVE ITT! i was skeptical but it&#x27;s worth it trust me guys screw the blending sponge this is so soft and wow best 21 bucks I&#x27;ve spent in ages</li>
    <li> I brought the travel set from sigma and also this brush to add to my collection( go to retailmenot.com for a coupon code).  I am addicted to trying out brushes and I am a happy buyer of this brush. It does blend your makeup very well for a flawless look with no steaks. I&#x27;ve had it for 8 months now and no shedding at all ( I wash it with dawn and Johnson &amp; Johnson conditioner). This is a must for makeup lovers.</li>
    <li> The brush is well made, but I thought the head of the brush would be bigger.  Was disappointed that it was not larger, but still a well made brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is just awesome.  I have not found a foundation brush that doesn&#x27;t leave terrible streaks in my foundation (MAC Studio Fix Fluid).  As a matter of fact, I had given up on foundation brushes when I decided to give this a try.  This brush is so good at blending.  I put 2 pumps of my foundation on the back of my hand, pick it up with the brush, and then blend it in to the skin starting in the center of the face.  That is enough to do my whole face.  I use a circular buffing motion.  After that, I go in and spot conceal with a different concealer.  This gives me the most flawless finish!  For those of you finding it impossible to get this brush clean, let me recommend to you the Daiso cleanser for Puff and Sponge - I got this here on Amazon but you can also find it on Ebay.  It will get everything out when other cleansers do not.</li>
    <li> Ok..so the title sounded cheesy, but it&#x27;s true. This brush kicks total butt. This is the first Sigma purchase I&#x27;ve made and I was absolutely blown away. I LOOOOVVVEEE it. I&#x27;m going to order the other two and a set of Sigma brushes very, very soon. I absolutely love this brush and use it every day. It&#x27;s super practical and is great at applying foundation. I have a lot of visible pores and acne scars and it made it so easy to blend to hide all my imperfections. I&#x27;m super thrilled about this brush, it is seriously the SOFTEST I&#x27;ve ever felt. Kinda of like velvet, but with longer strands. It feels great!  --Daniel&#x27;s wife, Maya (I just use his acct, b/c I only order a couple of things on Amazon) :D</li>
    <li> Best.Brush.Ever.&lt;br /&gt;absolutely love it. Will never buy anything else. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing - I purchased this brush with the F80. I use this brush to apply concealer and to finish off my foundation on my nose and under my eyes. I absolutely love this brush!!! It&#x27;s amazing - highly recommended!!![[ASIN:B0045W22SW Sigma Beauty Round Top Synthetic Kabuki - F82]]</li>
    <li> Love it! Great brush for a good price.</li>
    <li> This brush is everything what I expect and more. Very precise, but at the same time very soft. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Perfect for apply powder foundation. Excellent quality, love sigma brushes more than any other brand. Definitely going for to the complete precision kit, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed!  I use mineral (powder) foundation, and this brush buffs it on my face like it&#x27;s a second skin, and helps make the foundation more buildable. The bristles are *verrrry* soft and not harsh on my skin at all, but it works wonderfully in application of my makeup, even better than my ecotools brushes.  I will be buying more Sigma brushes to replace my current brushes.  Wonderful product, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for applying powder without it looking cakey.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of MAC products but hate when I pay the high end prices and get pieces of the brush bristles on my face.  These brushes were even of better quality than I have and delivery was nearly immediate.  I&#x27;m on line now to buy more....be careful they are large brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I use it with my Bare Minerals makeup and it offers an excellent application. The brush is comfortable in my hand when I am applying my mineral foundation. The brush hairs itself are so soft. I have found that many brushes similar to F82 tend to be scratchy. The Sigma F82 is the furthest thing from it. It makes appying my makeup feel amazing! I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a Kabuki style brush. The qualitly is absolutly amazing and the price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this brush and it is amazing. I love Sigmas face brushes. I am a huge fan of having my foundation looking amazing and Sigmas Brushes do that for me! If you dont have Sigma Brushes you have to buy this new collection that they recently came out with and all of there other brushes. Also..Sigma has wonderful customer service. It is the best customer service ever. I am very pleased with Sigma and the way they treat and take care of there customers. All of there brushes are amazing and I will eventually have every single brush from Sigma! You have to try there brushes ASAP and you wont be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE SIGMA! GREAT products!:) Just ordered my Sigma Beauty Round Top Synthetic Kabuki-F82 and I LOVE it! I will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. was pricey but worth it. I tried and failed 2 other brushes for blush application and this one beats the others-hands down. Great quality, better than MAC and I am a MAC addict! :)</li>
    <li> This was sort of an \\&quot;impulse\\&quot; buy....I was looking for a face cream by Salma Hayek and I happened to see these brushes. I pondered......my Bare Minerals kabuki brush is old so I rationalized that I could actually use a new brush and I liked the look of this one with the longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and ordered, then right away had buyers remorse, thinking to myself that I probably should not have spent that much money on the brush. When the brush arrived, I was worried when I saw that the bristles were much \\&quot;shorter\\&quot; in length than my Bare Minerals kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT......when I first used it.....I was THRILLED. My Bare Minerals foundation with this brush was MUCH BETTER than my original B.M. kabuki. The coverage was MUCH better, and I ended up using LESS makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush was WAY worth the money, I am so so glad I bought it!!!! If you are wondering about this one.....GO FOR IT. This brush will be your favorite brush, no question. I love it with my mineral foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using my Sigma kabuki brush for a couple months now, and I am still over the moon in love with it. Every time I use it I am so glad I stumbled upon it here on Amazon. This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used for my mineral foundation application. It makes the makeup go on smoothly, evenly and effortlessly. I have very blotchy skin with some redness, and the coverage with this brush is far superior to the Bare Escentuals kabuki. And I need less makeup than with the B.E. kabuki, yet I get great coverage. My skin looks like porcelain after applying my makeup with this brush, I kid you not. I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush. If you are considering buying this one, do not hesitate. You will be very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this brush for foundation, the reason I gave it four stars is because it seems like the actual brush hairs would be longer. Other than that, it is very soft, dense, and easy to work with!</li>
    <li> I 1st learned about using this brush to apply foundation from watching YouTube videos by EmilyNoel83.  Fabulous for applying foundation smoothly &amp; evenly!  Dot foundation in center of face &amp; use swirling motions with brush to spread to hairline and part of neck.  My college daughter tried it and said, &amp;#34;Why isn&#x27;t everyone in the whole world using this brush to apply foundation?!&amp;#34;  So, I purchased 2 of these brushes for my girls-  so they&#x27;d stop using mine!</li>
    <li> best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased! use it everyday. I don&#x27;t get fly-aways and I&#x27;ve been using about every day for 2 years</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife which  works as a make-up master and she was very satisfied to use sigma brushes</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush!!!  I use it to put on my foundation and seems to go on almost flawless.  Soft brush, washes nice.</li>
    <li> lo que yo esperaba y me funciona sigma es lo mejor, y llego a tiempo, y escuchado tanto acerca de este producto que supero mis espectativas, viva sigma</li>
    <li> This was my first liquid foundation brush and I love it! I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it looks like new whenever I wash it. I usually clean it with baby soap every two weeks (thoroughly) and the hairs are still all in tact. Best brush ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this brush, once I figured out what the brush could be used for! It is a great foundation and BB cream brush, but is at times difficult to use around various parts of your face (hairline, nose, etc.) but it works!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me soo long to get these brushes but they are worth every penny. I use this brush to blend out my concealer, which makes it so much easier than using your hands/fingers. Very pleased and I suggest everyone out there to not hesitate and invest in any Sigma brush.</li>
    <li> I have tried using this with multiple foundations, but it does best when I apply my foundation in tiny dots all over my face, then use this to buff it in.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve used in years! You&#x27;ll notice even coverage and flawless application of your liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Love my sigma brushes and this one is no exception!</li>
    <li> i ordered the flat top kabuki brush before and i love it so i decided i want this one too , so i ordered it but i got the same one i ordered before F80 :( , and no one ever replied</li>
    <li> Works fabulous with powder makeup.  Applies it so smooth.  I love this brush.  Will order the other sizes. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had tried multiple foundation brushes in the past and was not satisfied. I was ready to go back to applying my liquid foundation with my hands or a makeup sponge, but then decided to give this brush a chance. I had been curious about Sigma brushes for awhile and am extremely satisfied with this brush after only 2 uses. I was looking for a brush that could be used to apply foundation normally and also stipple on thicker coverage where I have old acne hyperpigmentation (I am SE Asian, our skin is very prone to hyperpigmentation) and the F82 does the job perfectly. I use this brush with Revlon Colorstay foundation in the combo/oily skin formula. I feel like I am using less product with this brush but still getting way better coverage than any other technique/brush I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other wonderful reviews about this brush. I have brushes by MAC, Sephora, and Clinique. I paid much more for those brushes and this brush is just as nice if not better. The bristles are soft yet firm enough to pick up product and transfer it evenly. You can transfer a lot or a little product with this brush. It&#x27;s a good as any professional brush out there. The hairs don&#x27;t shed and the bristles feel nice on your face. I will definitely continue to buy Sigma brushes. :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this brush. I ordered it after seeing someone apply their liquid foundation with it on youtube. I use it to apply my Colorstay liquid foundation and it goes on wonderfully!! I buff it right into my skin and I get so many compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought anything from Sigma before, but since my friend recommended it I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived within 3-4 days (standard shipping) and was boxed inside a Sigma package with brochures.&lt;br /&gt;The brush was AMAZINGLY soft and placed within a sturdy handle.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brush everyday and it still feels the same as when it first arrived to my house.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying Sigma brushes again in the future, and I recommend this product/company to beginners in beauty.</li>
    <li> IT IS FAKE!!!! I&#x27;M IN SHOCK!!! DEMAND A REFUND!!! THIS CHINESE STUFF!!!! $ 25!!!!! I&#x27;M IN SHOCK!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an ok brush. It&#x27;s good for powder foundation. It makes the powder really set on the skin. Looks nice. My only &#x27;but&#x27; is that it could be a bit larger. It&#x27;s really a tiny brush. Probably with less than 3cm diameter. So it kinda takes sometime to go over the whole face. Other than that, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation brush ever ! I already have the flat kabuki F80. I love the flat one but when I try this brush I loved it soooooo much ! Its nice smooth easy give airy effect. Absolutely TERRIFIC !!</li>
    <li> This is the softest line of brushes that I have ever used! Any of the Sigma brushes are definitely a must have for any makeup lover!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush from a recommendation on a blog.. glad I did. It works great,, and it&#x27;s nice and dense. I use this brish to apply my liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> This is my first sigma brush, and I am extremely happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I normally like to do online shopping after seeing the actual product in the store, or if a friend owns one, etc. because photos can be misleading and you never really see the quality of a product through pictures.&lt;br /&gt;Since there weren&#x27;t any sigma brushes lying around for me to play and test with, I was unsure...but all those beauty blogs rave about it....should I...should I not...(3 days later) CLICK! Purchased my first sigma brush!&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I made the big decision, (trust me I felt like I was doing a 15ft dive) because the brush is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t shed its bristles on my face, and it does not feel like I am skinning myself. It is soft, but has enough body and stiffness, perfect for a nice, thin, even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, but make sure to check the prices at the Sigma website. Some brushes are cheaper there than on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The package is not very attractive, but the brush works very well, what its important here, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awsome brush, excellent price, and I got it 3 days after purchase day. I am inlove with sigma brushes, my next purchase is going to be a full set on sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, I love the feel of it against my face. It delivers makeup better than any other brush I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
    <li> I like it i used it every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think its worth the price, dont get all the hipe, its a nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation looks ok, its faster to apply mi make up whit this</li>
    <li> I Just love this! Very well made and feels very strong. I think I&#x27;ll be having this brush for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try the sigma brushes for such a long time and finally decided to! I am so in love with the sigma round top kabuki-f82! it is so worth the money! My foundation finish was flawless! I am so impressed! I will be purchasing more sigma products in the near future!</li>
    <li> The brush started losing bristles like crazy after around 5 months of purchase. I love Sigma blushes and I am a very loyal Sigma customer but the P82 brush I purchased over the &amp;#34;etailz&amp;#34; I am not very happy with at all. None of my other brushes (and I have a fairly large collection) do lose this many bristles. I wash them with tap-cold water so it&#x27;s not like I am doing anything wrong. I sent to email to etailz and they did not reply to me at all.</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong brush :( They accidentally sent me the F80 instead of the F82. Great brush but not what I wanted</li>
    <li> Another wonderful brush!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush and although it was sold through Amazon it said it was fulfilled through Sigma Beauty. The brush itself is great and it came in authentic Sigma packaging.My only concern is that when I opened the brush there was a sticker on it that said Made in China over the USA stamp on the brush. Not sure if it&#x27;s a knock off or if Sigma had some made in China as a prototype and then wanted to unload them. Regardless, it&#x27;s a great quality brush- easy to clean and applies foundation like a dream!</li>
    <li> OMG!  Seriously why didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t MAC carry a kabuki make up brush???  I don&#x27;t know But that lead me to Sigma and this AMAZING round kabuki brush.  I L-O-V-E it!!  I used to apply my foundation with a sponge.  I tried the foundation brush by MAC but it was too streaky and took so much longer.  Enter Sigma&#x27;s F82 Round Kabuki (via JacklynHill1 tutorial on youtube) HOLY COW!  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in foundation application with this brush.  Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold ten times over.  Smooth finish and you can bet I&#x27;ll be buying a spare, and maybe a spare to the spare.  If you don&#x27;t have one - GET ONE!! NOW.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I like this round top kabuki better than the flat top version that Sigma also has out. It lets me get into all the little nooks better than the flat top and leaves a flawless and amazing airbrushed finish. The brush is dense and EXTREMELY soft, doesn&#x27;t irritate or scratch the skin at all. No shedding at all, and I wash my brush with baby shampoo after each use. Price is extremely reasonable for such a high quality brush. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I had previously written a review based on packaging and I rated it poorly because my sigma brush had a dent on the metal piece, which caused some of the bristles to misalign.  I contacted Amazon, and the customer service I received was excellent.  Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the actual product.  This product is great with powders.  I use it for my mineral powder and it picks up enough products and does not pack it on.  The bristles are very soft.  The product has a little bit of a weight to it, therefore it does not feel cheap.  Overall, great item!</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are very good, this one I use for liquid foundation on small areas (under eyes for example) or the whole face, great for everything.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush.  I use it with liquid foundation and I love it.  It blends flawlessly.  It does not shed and is easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve purchased brushes that were three times as expensive that didn&#x27;t work any better.  I highly recommend this brush</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s absolutely what I want. Very good quality, useful design and easy manipulation also for beginners :)&lt;br /&gt;Are you looking for good quality/ price brushes? This is right choice!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!! They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
    <li> So soft on my face, huge difference from the expensive brand name brush I had been using. A huge bonus - it holds on to the powdered mineral foundation as I apply it to my face. No powder flying all over the place! I think the brush will pay for itself just on the savings from my mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> Excellent foundation brush, dense and very well shaped, creates a beautiful flawless and airbrushed effect.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my mineral foundation. The bristles are nice &amp; dense &amp; haven&#x27;t shed on me. Using this brush provides great coverage. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> This makeup brush is perfect for applying your liquid or creme foundations...it&#x27;s bristles are soft but very dense and it seems well made...it gives the appearance of having air brushed your foundation...I washed it and there was no bristle fallout...This seller packaged it very well and the shipping was super fast!!</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVE this brush! It is my first &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; brush (compared to the $7 ones at drug stores) and I absolutely love it. I use it to put on my liquid foundation and it goes on so evenly! No streaks. And it feels very sturdy, not cheaply made at all (so far). I would recommend this for using a liquid founation definitely</li>
    <li> 1. This Sigma Round Kabuki is amazing. The brush is so soft and feels really nice when you apply it over the skin. It doesn´t loose any bristles! It gives excellent coverage of the surface when applying either liquid or powder products. The case is simply fabulous, and the shipping was efficcient and fast. I am completely satisfied with my sigma brushes and I definetly recommend them. It´s amazing how perfectly intact the brush remains after being washed. Thanks Sigma!</li>
    <li> You have it try this brush you will love it. You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price. I will Purchase  the set now</li>
    <li> Purchase only these brushes now; the best I&#x27;ve ever found; clean up is a snap by just putting some cleanser - I use Philosophy purity cleanser not soap or dish soap in my hand and swish the brush and rinse thoroughly.  Once a week works well for me.  Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying my foundation with a sponge and recently saw a video for using this brush.  I wanted a more even finish with my foundation and this has done the trick!  I am very happy with the result and it is so much easier than using a sponge.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush for applying foundation &amp; blending</li>
    <li> Maybe this brush is not for me.. I like how thick it is and its of top quality I just didn&#x27;t like how bulky it felt on my face and a bit hard, its a soft brush, but it has so many strands tightly packed that it feels too dense for me.. but it might just be me. :o/</li>
    <li> Best brush you could use for mineral or loose makeup, brissels are soft and don&#x27;t shed. Need a Sigma store in the Phoenix area.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few makeup brushes in the past. Some were lousy, some were decent, but none impressed me much...until now. I ran across Sigma brushes at Amazon and, after reading some reviews, I somewhat reluctantly decided to try one (the stippling brush). After owning it several months, I was so impressed that I bought two more brushes (the Angled and Round Kabuki). I LOVE ALL OF THEM! They feel wonderful on your face (almost like mink, or one of those really soft velvety blankets). They apply and blend makeup nicely. They appear to be well made, look stylish, and are priced very reasonably for the quality of the brushes. And best of all...my very favorite feature...they haven&#x27;t shed a single hair! :) I was duped into purchasing a MAC blush brush a while back, and though it put my blush on reasonably well, it shed horribly. I just can&#x27;t tolerate a brush that leaves a bunch of stray hairs behind all over my face. Yuck! Enough said. Honestly, a repeat purchase kind of says it all!</li>
    <li> I have tried other brushes but Sigma is the best! You cannot bet these brushes! I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Sigma brushes are wonderful.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. It is very dense, SO soft and blends my foundation in perfectly. The packaging by Sigma was really impressive. I would 100% recommend this product to a friend and I plan on getting more Sigma products in the future!!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge Sigma brush fan!  I decided to add this to my collection to put my foundation on with.  I&#x27;ve always, always used a sponge to put on my foundation and was very skeptical that I would like this brush as much as my sponge.  It covers VERY well, and I will never use a sponge again!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this brush for foundation. I like how it is dense and it is soft. I use this for my liquid foundation all the time.</li>
    <li> Out of the four Sigmax brushes, this one and the flat top kabuki would be my ALL-TIME FAVORITES! This one on top of all the other ones ;)  It feels, looks and works AMAZINGLY WELL!! yes, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, (for my taste), but it&#x27;s really worth it and it truly does LAST1 :) no shedding or anything of that nonesense :D Get it ;)</li>
    <li> Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get much better than the beauty blender I was wrong. I don&#x27;t use brushes for foundation ever, my first purchase after all the rave but it was really worth it. Made me a believer in it isn&#x27;t just the kind of foundation you&#x27;re using but WHAT you&#x27;re using to apply is probably just as if not more important. I went back and tried foundations I had pushed to the side and saw it looked flawless with this brush. I love it</li>
    <li> Well made brush! Perfect size for blending in foundation or for contouring. It&#x27;s a nice, thick,  dense brush,  perfect for medium/full coverage makeup applications.  I&#x27;ve already washed it and it helped up wonderfully. No shedding.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m new to this make up thing. I&#x27;m.starting. a channel on you tube and from all the videos I watch everyone is using sigma. I was going to go with Mac because everyone knows Mac but when I got this brush I loved it. Its great quality it does not shed. Its soft and feels.great in your hands. I cant wait to.start my make journey this will be fun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miloc429@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Love this for applying my foundation and even contouring. It&#x27;s super easy to clean and leaves a nice airbrush finish.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. So soft and sturdy.......It buffs liquid and cream in like no other i&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve been looking for months!!! THIS ONE WINS !!! I especially love using it with my Pro Longwear Concealer from MAC as my foundation............. Going to buy a 2nd brush for back up soon..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(( i also tried the flat angled kabuki brush, and it leaves streaks on my face))</li>
    <li> Going to wear it our! Already planning on getting the rest of set. Know what the hype is all about now.</li>
