<li> hate that Amazon just throws them in the box with our other S&amp;S items; we&#x27;ve had a few soapy surprises.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not the worst</li>

    <li> Smells ready good, only takes a small amount</li>
    <li> Was busted and leaking into the box next to food product! Unacceptable!</li>
    <li> Another nice body wash by Dial. Smells good and last throughout the day. I did not use this product on my hair, only as a body wash. Felt clean, and no leftover residue, like with some other body washes. Soaps up quickly and lasts my entire shower. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for my husband.</li>

    <li> Works well and smells great.  Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t lather the greatest.  Overall still very pleased</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, it serves its purpose. Nothing great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s not the worst infact it&#x27;s a nice combo to shower and wash hair same time and the fact that I work a very dirty job I go through two bottles a month to keep clean and have a mild not overpowering odor..so I would recommend</li>
    <li> Great scent and lather wells.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband once and he loves it... all of the kinds smell great (and the scent lasts for hours) and he likes that it&#x27;s made to act as a shampoo and bodywash (as opposed to washing his body with shampoo or his hair with soap).I hate that Amazon just throws them in the box with our other S&amp;S items; we&#x27;ve had a few soapy surprises.</li>
    <li> My husband and son love this stuff</li>
    <li> works as expected now sbscribed for even better pricing.</li>
    <li> My boys LOVE this hair and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;They say its better than Dove.</li>
    <li> Doctor said to stop using Dial... If a PhD says no then you might not want to use this anymore, ask your physician.</li>
    <li> Husband uses this, it smells great, sporty and fresh. He does not complain of feeling dirty or dry, so it works!</li>
    <li> Smells great, love it!</li>
    <li> Other products cost more, do the same. This will get you clean.</li>
    <li> Did not like the texture or color; not a clean pour and is a weird blue color.  Reminds me of blue motor oil.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my Old Spice body wash.</li>
    <li> I finally find a combination shampoo for body wash and hair that works great, lathers extremely well and doesn&#x27;t break the bank and OH by the way, cleans very well.  UPDATE:   hOW DID THIS PRODUCT GO FROM A $3.47 &amp;#34;ADD-ON&amp;#34; TO ALMOST $12.00.  IF THAT&#x27;S THE CASE, THERE ARE PLENTY OTHER PRODUCTS TO CJOOSE FROM!</li>
    <li> Nice clean fresh smell.  Leaves my skin and my husband&#x27;s skin feeling clean, but neither of us felt our skin was overly dry after our showers. Dial Men&#x27;s Hair and Body Wash can be used on the body, but also on the hair. It leaves my hair and my husband&#x27;s hair smelling really fresh; it feels soft and manageable as well. Our younger son tried it as well and thinks he smells &amp;#34;very clean and manly&amp;#34;. (That might be an oxymoron! But he did smell pretty darned good!</li>
    <li> Works well and I use it daily. Really like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, not too fragrant but helps me feel clean without having to use too much of it.</li>
    <li> Stinks good, scrubs good, is good.</li>
    <li> Purchased for son who like products. Good price.</li>
