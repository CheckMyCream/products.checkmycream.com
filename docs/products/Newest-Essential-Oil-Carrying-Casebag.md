      <li>but it&#x27;s very well crafted and holds most of my oils about 30 oils!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a really great carrier very well made, attractive to look at and holds bottles tight and secure.</li>

      <li>and I don&#x27;t need anything large right now.</li>
      <li>Good quality product if your looking for something small to carry your oils.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t look at certain patterns and color combinations</li>
      <li>Absolutely WILL NOT hold 26 15ml vials.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
      <li>so I am so excited about this essential oils carrying case.</li>
      <li>The colors are true to the picture and there should be no worries about the different sizes of the oils fitting because the sides on the inside move back and forth to accommodate the different size bottles: I haven&#x27;t received my oils yet.</li>
      <li>Love the extra large area at the back for larger bottles or accessories.</li>
      <li>then it is but love the small size.</li>
      <li>It does technically fit the really large 30ml bottles (only in the larger back areas not in the 18 smaller sections)</li>
      <li>It feels really sturdy and like it&#x27;ll last.</li>
      <li>Altogether it will tightly hold about thirty 10ml bottles of essential oils, if you use all the space available.</li>
      <li>Do not buy it, the slots are not wide enough.</li>

    <li> This was exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Wish it was bigger but it&#x27;s very well crafted and holds most of my oils about 30 oils! Underestimated how many oils I have! Simply love it!</li>
    <li> This case is absolutely adorable and Im in love with it. The bottom is attached so there is no oils falling through the compartments when carrying. It holds my 5 ml and 10 ml bottles perfectly. I like the 2 extra larger compartments to place an empty glass oil bottle and stainless steel oil funnel in one and a small container of carrier oil in the other. Whoever came up with that design high fives!!!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift and I&#x27;m so excited to give it to her, it&#x27;s so cute and great quality!!</li>
    <li> I have to return it. My bottles will not fit. Do not buy it, the slots are not wide enough. I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil bag. It fits a variety of sizes of oils. I also like the two bigger pockets upfront so that I can say other things instead of just oil.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bag but the zipper sticks</li>
    <li> Heavy duty canvas material and gorgeous print! I love it as my on the go emergency first aid kit.</li>
    <li> Good quality product if your looking for something small to carry your oils. Too small for me.</li>
    <li> Great carrier. I have already filled it so I do wish I had gotten two!  Or that they made a larger one in a more appealing fabric!  The fabric on mine is the blue and it is beautiful. Fits all my large and small bottles (5/15 ml). Love the extra large area at the back for larger bottles or accessories. It does technically fit the really large 30ml bottles (only in the larger back areas not in the 18 smaller sections) although you could not zip it if you had more than 1-3 of them in the large sections standing up. If you laid the bottles down no problem but I would not want to do that with my oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a really great carrier very well made, attractive to look at and holds bottles tight and secure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case!!! I can&#x27;t look at certain patterns and color combinations so I am so excited about this essential oils carrying case. I did not pay attention to the size when I bought it but that&#x27;s ok because I&#x27;m just getting started in essential oils and I don&#x27;t need anything large right now. It&#x27;s about the size of a small makeup bag. The colors are true to the picture and there should be no worries about the different sizes of the oils fitting because the sides on the inside move back and forth to accommodate the different size bottles: I haven&#x27;t received my oils yet. It feels really sturdy and like it&#x27;ll last.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and wonderful for toting my DoTerra oils!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Keeps oils organized and handy.  Pretty too!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed... may have to get another. Looks good and is sturdy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this case. I imagined it to be larger then it is but love the small size. The bottles fit nice and snug.</li>
    <li> Perfect bag for keeping my EO&#x27;s store safely and securely!</li>
    <li> Expensive for small size&lt;br /&gt;Size not specified</li>
    <li> Sturdy, tight stitching.  Wish it was bigger.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another.</li>
    <li> Comes exactly as pictured. I wish it held bigger bottles but it is a great carrying case for a starter kit! Would be nice if it came with stickers to put on the bottle caps.</li>
    <li> This is really nice and perfect for all the oils. Great not just for traveling but for displaying on your counter too.</li>
    <li> Super cute and perfect fof my oils!</li>
    <li> Good material. It&#x27;s very well made. Altogether it will tightly hold about thirty 10ml bottles of essential oils, if you use all the space available. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely WILL NOT hold 26 15ml vials. I&#x27;ll be lucky is I can fit 20 in there. DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
