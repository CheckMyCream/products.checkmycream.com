      <li>This satin hands kit is fun, fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s $69 in Australia!!&lt;br /&gt;Given that Mary Kay is a direct sales company and do not allow retail outlets to sell their wares online, I&#x27;m wondering how Amazon is able to circumvent this?</li>

      <li>but i got the product pretty fast</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff</li>
      <li>However, after about 3 weeks I noticed the lotion being very watery, to the point that I couldn&#x27;t even rub it on my hands and feel the texture of a lotion anymore.</li>
      <li>I appreciate how fast the product arrived.  </li>
      <li>Hand scrub was not full...1/4 empty and even though I order peach scent one of the creams was scent free!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of messy to have to unscrew the cap with your hands covered with step #1.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product that changes the skin on your hands from aged, dry, and wrinkled, to supple, moist, and young looking,and can only be trusted when buying fresh from an independent consultant, try www.marykay.com/cramlow and it will be fresh, new, 100% guaranteed, Free Shipping and Free Samples to boot!</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin that cracks easily.  </li>
      <li>My Husband even loves it, and my Mother and Sister use it everyday now next to their sink, and it&#x27;s sooo pretty to have out for guests in a guest bathroom and makes for a beautiful gift, the gift of younger looking hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a totally excellent product and the service was terrific.</li>
    <li> Crap, not at all what was supposed to be. There was no Mary Kay product in what I received</li>
    <li> Great!  Great price, great service, great product!</li>
    <li> A perfect gift!  The Mary Kay Satin Hands Pampering Set was reasonably prices and very good for the hands!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and does wonders to your hands</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and what a great price!  I use MK Satin Hands and got this set for my mother in-law , who loves it.</li>
    <li> i got this for me i love it</li>
    <li> Anyone who has ever used these products can tell you how wonderful they are. Amazing. I didn&#x27;t know there was a peach scent, and I love it, very nice, not overpowering, just enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 star rating because it is expensive and not what I was looking forward to.&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced at a Mary Kay facial party and was given a 1 time demonstration of the satin hands products. I fell in love with how soft my hands were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the hype. I bought a bottle. And the first few times it worked great. However, after about 3 weeks I noticed the lotion being very watery, to the point that I couldn&#x27;t even rub it on my hands and feel the texture of a lotion anymore. I would rub and my hands wouldn&#x27;t glide like the usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed it in the garbage and won&#x27;t be buying it again. It truly is a shame because when it worked it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> This has to be the smoothest that my hands have been after using&lt;br /&gt; the Satin Hands....yes there is 3 steps but is amazing results.</li>
    <li> This product set is perfect! From the peach fragrance to the effectiveness of each of the three product steps. I work for a competitor company that sells a similar hand kit, and I hate to admit, they have us beat!</li>
    <li> I love Satin Hands, HOWEVER, this set is NOT all PEACH scent. The moisturizer you use first will always come as UNSCENTED, even from Mary Kay direct. Secondly, the exfoliant was missing about 1/2&amp;#34; from top.... So I felt a little shorted.</li>
    <li> This is a good price on this product. It works well and my hands did feel soft and satiny. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I first have to say that I love the smell of this product, and I love that it makes my hands feel so soft. I have really dry hands, and they crack and bleed a lot because I use so much sanitizer, and I wash my hands a lot. This has been helping to keep them from cracking and bleeding. Thank you. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> You can not trust product not sold by an independent consultant, it&#x27;s like trying to buy quality salon hair products at the swap meet and getting old, bad product. This is an amazing product that changes the skin on your hands from aged, dry, and wrinkled, to supple, moist, and young looking,and can only be trusted when buying fresh from an independent consultant, try www.marykay.com/cramlow and it will be fresh, new, 100% guaranteed, Free Shipping and Free Samples to boot! My Husband even loves it, and my Mother and Sister use it everyday now next to their sink, and it&#x27;s sooo pretty to have out for guests in a guest bathroom and makes for a beautiful gift, the gift of younger looking hands.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Best hand care things I have ever used. It smells good. it feels good, an you only need to use a little, and it will last forever!</li>
    <li> exfoliation for your hand make your hands so soft and smooth.  creams makes it much better. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for mothers day and she loved it! I was a little worried about the peach but it smells so fresh! Mary Kay has great products and this satin hands set worked perfect as a gift. Who doesn&#x27;t love soft silky hands!</li>
    <li> I used this when a rep brought this to my work site. I use it myself and give it as gifts. It&#x27;s so easy to order online.</li>
    <li> I love the set the only thing is they sent me one item that was not peach  scent and it was a gift  was a little upset but i got the product pretty fast so was very happy with that</li>
    <li> I use it to pamper my feet, and my hands just can&#x27;t help but get pampered too!  A good product.</li>
    <li> First I only buy products from my consultant who happens to be my Sister. It is the only way to get your 100% satisfaction guarantee and to make sure that products being sold have not expired. I love this product it really keeps my hand looking smooth and youth full. For a full time Mom who is washing, cleaning, and doing horrible things to her hands this should be your first purchase. The peach sent is not overwhelming like some other Mary Kay products. This is one of the very few thing I will purchase time and time again.</li>
    <li> very nice product all my friends love it as I do The peach scent is really nice and my hands look great</li>
    <li> I just love satin hands. My hands feel great after using for hours....aids in keeping them young looking as well. I have used this product for years. Love it love it.</li>
    <li> Used as gift for Christmas and person receiving was very pleased.  Package came in tack with all liquids in containers that shipped well.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the pump was broken on the scrub when I received. It&#x27;s kind of messy to have to unscrew the cap with your hands covered with step #1. Didn&#x27;t think it was worth sending back for a new one.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, item was exactly as described! :)</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this as she works in a fast food place and her hands get really dry and chapped.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED ALL OF MARY KAY PRODUCTS, HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS COULD NOT FIND ANY ONE AROUND SO ORDERED IT ONLINE</li>
    <li> I have kept a set of this onhand for many years.  It is wonderful for dry, overworked hands.  Even severely dry hands will benefit.</li>
    <li> Thankyou for the quick service...I really like this stuff, it makes my hands feel and smell so good.  If you hadnt tried it you should.</li>
    <li> This satin hands kit is fun, fast and easy to use. It&#x27;s a 3 step kit which takes minutes to get soft peachy smelling hands. I even got my husband to use it so we can both pamper ourselves instead of paying top dollar for the spa. I have the paraffin wax machine which is good but takes an hour to heat up and creates a mess of wax when you&#x27;re done. Satin Hands is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This is magic for your hands.  Feels so good to use this, and the scent is not bad.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay products and their Satin Hands Pampering Set is wonderful. It helps keep my hands smooth and young looking!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  It is really effective in keeping my hands soft and \\&quot;crack free\\&quot; through the winter.  Love the peach smell!</li>
    <li> I bought my third set alteady. Can not stop loving it. Never will do without it again. I love Mar Kay</li>
    <li> After about two applications, I could tell a difference in the look and appearance of my hands.  This product delivers......</li>
    <li> Love smelling like peaches.</li>
    <li> Made a good gift to our daughter when she arrived home from working in Alaska. Her hands were so dry and needed some tlc.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product</li>
    <li> Best product for hands and feet, cures cracked skin.</li>
    <li> I just received the Satin Hands set.  I appreciate how fast the product arrived.  I have two big problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) All three items appear to have been used before.  The hand cream appears 50% empty; The softener appears about 15% empty.  The scrub bottle is about 1&amp;#34; down from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The scrub bottle does not dispense.  The top is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first negative review of a product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The material is first class I recommend to anyone who wants to buy that is very worthwhile because it is very good.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.  It makes my hands soooo soft. I already had my own set so I bought this one for someone as a Christmas gift.  It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> About every 6 months my husband complains that his hands are dry, rough and the skin is nearly cracking.  This product has worked for him for years.  The waxy cream and scrub really do the trick to remove the dead dry skin and smooth it all out.  I love it for my hands as well.  I use it every 3 months or so, but the lotion I use daily.</li>
    <li> Have loved this set for many years. perfect for dry winter hands. I also use it on my feet, knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for Christmas and it is much loved! Great product and shipped very quickly. Wonderful purchase will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says... my hands have a noticible difference in their apperance, and the softness is also... Pleased customer...</li>
    <li> Given as a gift; person enjoyed it</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin that cracks easily.  This product does a good job of smoothing out my hands.  Unfortunately, my skin does not stay that way very long.</li>
    <li> Makes hands soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Hand scrub was not full...1/4 empty and even though I order peach scent one of the creams was scent free!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It keeps my hands nice and soft and smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hands. I own a heating and cooling company, and it cleans ,some of the worst debris off my hands, and leaves my hands soft. I buy many sets from this site. I am very pleased,  and will buy more in the future, when I run out.</li>
    <li> My hands were having some challenges.  I remembered that years ago I had had Mary Kay Satin Hands Pampering Set ~ Peach .  So I went searching for some to buy.  This arrived on time and is just what the doctor ordered for my hands.</li>
    <li> Great product, used to sell Mary Kay.  This is one of the best products.</li>
    <li> What can I say? The product is aptly named your hands will be truly pampered and satinnie smooth. Try it!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for rough hands</li>
    <li> Satin Hands is a brilliant series. I purchase it from my local Mary Kay consultant. It&#x27;s $69 in Australia!!&lt;br /&gt;Given that Mary Kay is a direct sales company and do not allow retail outlets to sell their wares online, I&#x27;m wondering how Amazon is able to circumvent this?</li>
