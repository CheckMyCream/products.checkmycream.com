<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell and love that it&#x27;s natural, but it&#x27;s VERY drying.</li>
    <li> This nice thick soap smells coconut-y and mildly sweet -- and the smell gives off a sense of thickness and creaminess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using this soap for my whole body and my face, not just to get clean but also as shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot; especially for my legs. It&#x27;s almost like this soap can be used like lotion, kind of. What I do in order to get a really smooth feel on my legs after shaving for example is really rub in the soap on my skin, then shave, then rinse off but not too thoroughly, or with luke-warm water, that way you don&#x27;t end up with like alligator, scaly skin once you towel off. After using this soap, shaving, lightly rinsing, toweling off and not using anything else (like lotion) on my legs, they feel really soft and smooth, almost like I did use lotion on the shaved areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the ingredients list as none of them seem to be harmful or carcinogenic nor does the smell give me a headache, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes in products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as complaints, they&#x27;re pretty minor. This one might not even be a complaint but sometimes when I shave I freak out a bit because some of the little orange-brown-ish flakes come from the soap and at first I&#x27;m like \\&quot;oh my god is that a scab?!\\&quot; but no, it&#x27;s just from the soap as you wear it down from use :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint but nothing really serious sort of complaint I guess is price, since I&#x27;m currently reviewing on Amazon. It looks like the normal price for this is like $4? I know that you can buy this in bulk from amazon and that&#x27;s probably what you should do. Otherwise look elsewhere like vitacost to get them individually if you don&#x27;t feel like paying $4 or more. then again amazon gives you free shipping... up to you I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soap though.</li>
    <li> And it isn&#x27;t a bad soap but it feels a little sticky. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal for this brand but it&#x27;s a little bit off-putting. I used the whole bar though and liked it overall except for the stickiness.</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this soap as it is natural. It leaves the skin soft and may even minimize scars with continued use. The effectual aid it offers the skin is unlike any other I have tried. I use this on my face along with Nubian Raw Shea butter lotion. Raw Shea Butter not only helps repair skin and eases conditions like severe dryness, eczema and psoriasis. Raw Shea Butter helps prevent further damage by providing UV protection from the Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.[[ASIN:B000J3ZMQA Nubian Heritage Coconut &amp; Papaya Soap 5 Oz X 6 Bars]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000MC5US8 Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion 13 Fl. Oz]]</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like regular soap and the smell is great. I just ordered more!</li>
    <li> maybe its me and my skin but after a couple of uses my skin became dry and itchy with dry spots i throw it away</li>
    <li> Wonderful Scent !  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I think my husband and I will like it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the Nubian Heritage soaps. I purchased the papaya and carrot pomegranate soaps from a market a few months ago trying to brighten the areas of my body that I have shaved and have become darker, for example, my underarms. The soap did work with the brightening it was almost unbelievable. Nubian Heritage soaps make my skin so soft not to mention they all smell wonderful. They are affordable and the only soap I will purchase from now on.</li>
    <li> My order did arrive a little late(thats why it got 4 stars), but the soap is amazing! Me and my husband use it as our \\&quot;face wash\\&quot;, and it works wonders! It does better than all the chemical filled, extra pricey stuff we&#x27;ve used in the past. It keeps our faces clean, clear, and glowing! (sn# neither of us had seriously bad skin, just the occaisional pimple, but I did have dark spots from my teen years, and using this soap along with raw shea butter has made most disappear, and even the worst ones lighten, I&#x27;m sure in time they&#x27;ll all be gone.)</li>
    <li> This is the most rich &amp; luxurious soap ever. I love the feel &amp; smell of it &amp; how soft it leaves my skin. It&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel invigorated and clean, helps with my acne and such. two thumbs up for this amazing product.</li>
    <li> this soap an the shea butter soap works good. Dont buy the dudu-osun soap tho. It will leave your shower looking like mud. These soaps smell so good i wish i could eat them. Makes you wanna go to Africa an see what other secrets they been hiding.</li>
    <li> This soap smells good, but too sweet for me.it lathers well, and is moisturizing. nubian heritage have the best soaps out there. citrus scents are more up my alley.</li>
    <li> This is the first soap that I have purchased from Nubian Heritage. When I took it out of the box I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it. It smells Divine! I wish they made candy that tastes like this smells!&lt;br /&gt;It lathers very nicely, rinses well, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and it left my skin very soft and clean feeling. I also use this on my face. I have acne prone skin and it has dimminished my acne.&lt;br /&gt;My son has been using this soap and his acne on his arms has gone down almost 80% . Its a very healing soap. It contains coconut oil as well as coconut seed butter. The Bar seems to last a long time, as long as you keep it out of the water. I keep mine in a small plastic cup away from the shower stream. Tonight I washed my hair with it, used my usual conditioner. I have long, wavy ,somewhat frizzy, dry hair that has been color treated and bleached.  I was concerned about using it as shampoo, but my hairs ok, probably less drying than my shampoo, and I only use salon Products. My Hair is surprisingly soft! I love this soap, I will buy more, Its healing, smoothing and moisturizing! They would make great gifts. I actually bought mine at the Vitamin shoppe, they had it on sale for 3.14 so I said \\&quot;why not\\&quot; .... I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> This soap has been amazing. My daughter had a rash/severe dry skin. After just a week she was noticing a difference. Plus it smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Really nice sized bar of soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate your flesh like those chemical soaps in stores.  Doesn&#x27;t make your parts burn, if you know what I mean.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like most other soaps. Minimal burning of the eyes but nowhere near as bad as ordinary soap.  Smells great and lathers really well.  You really do feel clean after using this soap.  5 star quality product, and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After doing some research and finding out that most commercial soaps are full of chemicals and animal by-products and also tested on animals i found this at my local Vitamin Shoppe. I love that they only use natural ingredients. Cruelty free. And no animal by-products. And it smells fresh and clean and in my opinion much better than the other main stream soaps. I think I have tried all of their soaps and they all work very well and smell nice. I have been using them for over a year and will continue to use them. Very happy with their products.</li>
    <li> I bough this about a month ago use it every night before bed on my face and It is still about 5oz This bar will last me a long time . The smell is wonderful  and leaves my face feeling clean.  I have senitive acne pron skin and it does NOT break my face out. I love this soap for my face I like how soft it leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loooooveee this soap. The smell of this soap is heavenly. Smells just like the name of it. Not only does this soap makes a different on my skin from head to toe, its 100% natural... This company makes great soaps and other products that I use. I&#x27;m a buyer for life unless something happens and they&#x27;re no longer sold.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent and the exfoliating bits</li>
    <li> I actually do like the Coconut &amp; Papaya Soap, but it really hasn&#x27;t made a MUCH improvement for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a full month now. The only difference is that some of scars have faded just a little, but my major scars from years ago/stretch marks are still there. I also use this soap after I have applied the DuDu Osun soap first. The Coconut/Papaya just gives my skin that extra moisture from the DuDu Osun Soap. But overall this soap get a B+</li>
    <li> Fine as far as soap goes, but I had to throw mine away after a few weeks because I found the scent so irritating.  My whole bathroom smelled of this soap--it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It produces lots of bubbles and smells great! I use it with African Black soap to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is actually really good soap-for those of you who do not have issues with acne and break outs. This made my skin look AWESOME! I loved the way it glowed and felt. But I found myself getting breakouts on top of radiant skin lol. I&#x27;m going to treat these acne spots and maybe return to this soap with a good balance between the two.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the African black soap first and really liked it. My skin felt clean. It was noticeably brighter after my first wash and my pores weren&#x27;t as big. I noticed that some dark spots were lighter after the first few washes. While I loved the African black soap, it tended to be a bit too drying for the rest of my body. It&#x27;s fine for my face (it can get very oily) but it would make my skin kind of itchy even after I applied lotion. So that just gave me an excuse to buy another bar of soap lol. I decided to get the coconut papaya one because of all the good reviews it had, one youtuber said it even helped with her hyper-pigmentation, which i have a lot of. I love the scent of the soap. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong. It&#x27;s lather feels a lot richer than the African black soap, I&#x27;m guessing because it&#x27;s the coconut milk. Anyways, I love it. It moisturized my skin which is exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m really starting to like this brand of soap.</li>
    <li> Lovely coconut smell, creamy lather.  Only downside is that it has bit of what I think are actually coconut shell (which can startle you if you aren&#x27;t aware).</li>
    <li> I actually bought this soap from a local store since I didn&#x27;t want to wait and pay shipping.  Same brand though, love Nubian Heritage products.  This soap is divine.  I also use the black soap which is drying so I use the coconut papaya one after I rince off the black soap because it seems to conditions the skin and my skin is less dry.  Using the two together has been wonderful.  I have 20 year old stretch marks from childbirth that are fading!  Anything that can do that is a winner in my book. I thought I would be stuck with those for life and never really tried to do away with them since I thought it was a lost cause.  Then I started using these products and I swear in two weeks I started to notice that those stretch marks were fading and some disappeared all together.  I told my boyfriend and he said it was placebo effect but then he started to really notice dark spots fading and completely disappearing as well and now he is using the soap too which means now I have to buy more since it is going quite fast. Also got my teen and 22 year old to start using it.  Now my bathroom smells like a tropical paradise every time I bathe and now showering is no longer a chore but I actually look forward to the process. And my skin is smooth like a baby.  This soap is a little more expensive than your average chemical filled soap but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This smells great and works like it should. Makes my scars less noticeable and softens my skin like nothing else. This combine with African black soap has completely changed my skin and my husbands. I have used other papaya soaps and this one smells by far the best. Even if it didn&#x27;t work I would still buy it for the small.</li>
    <li> This product worked fabulous!Had it for about 2 monthes now and it helped rid me older stretch marks that I thought would stay there forever.It truly brightens the skin and makes you look radiant. Two thumbs up!I wash with it every morning and my ance is gone,scars fading and just plain even skintone. This soaps lasts pretty long and smells fantastic like a tropical island punched you in the face, and is a good morning pick me up!</li>
    <li> This product really surprised me, i ordered it on faith! I&#x27;ve tried many different products and nothing has every made me feel so beautiful. My skin is always glowing, i got both the soap and lotion use them twice a day (morning &amp; night) and on my upper  body and the lotion on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and i hope you enjoy this product as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this product is sold at your wholefoods also so i don&#x27;t have to wait for it anymore.</li>
    <li> Smells great, evens out your skin tone but you have to continuously use it to see results</li>
    <li> Allergic reaction!!! Im pretty sure its because of the oils that they use to make the scent. Itchy all over the place!!! Other than that its a pretty good soap. It lathers alot better than name brands like Dove and it doesnt dry my skin. I really do wish I wasnt allergic to this or ill buy it again. In the trash it goes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51yrs and I think I need T.L.C. with my cleaning products. I think this is a good place to start.</li>
    <li> This is a very luxurious soap.  It makes an excellent lather, smells great and does not dry out my skin.  Very satisfied !</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath soap. Gentle and does not cause me to break out.  I am trying to remove all things in my bathroom with harmful chemicals and harsh ingredients.  My skin feels soft, clean, and hydrated after using this soap.  I just wish I could get it locally.</li>
    <li> I love how it lathers, smells and makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s one of my favorites in this line and it seems to be working well for my eczema.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this soap in 2011 from a friend who is chemically sensitive to almost everything. This was the soap she gave me to use while visiting her home for a few days. It is wonderful, fell in love with the texture, the feel, the smell. Love how it cleans without leaving a soapy scum or a dry feeling. Just perfect for our family...and it seems to help with my youngest son&#x27;s breakouts on his back also.</li>
    <li> Such a nice sturdy bar soap without the harsh chemicals. Beautiful scent, leaves skin so nice.</li>
    <li> Really great soap. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this as I didnt like NH&#x27;s hemp-vetiver soap but this coconut-papaya soap feels much softer on my skin. This soap costs the same per bar as Mountain Ocean&#x27;s coconut soap but it&#x27;s 0.5 ounces bigger. I&#x27;m not a papaya fan but this soap smells terrific and the vanilla beans don&#x27;t scratch my skin. Definitely worth it!!!</li>
    <li> It is my first time to try this soap and I enjoy using it. the texture is smooth and it smells really good :-)</li>
    <li> I felt itchy like crazy and had a little rash on my body. I was itching all over. I wasn&#x27;t itching that way before I used it. So I know it has to be the soap. I used it twice. I loved the light coconut smell and the softness it delivered upon sudsing. However after I rinsed it left me dryer than before and I was itchy. Ugh. There must be something in it that I&#x27;m allergic too or my body doesn&#x27;t like. I will be switching to 100percentpure body coconut body gel. I love coconut. I wish I could find an all natural goats milk or buttermilk with honey body wash but there isn&#x27;t much of a choice out there. I wish that my area would get a more variety of natural body products. I bought this soap at my local VitameShop. A lot of these natural soaps out here still have harmful ingredients. So far I&#x27;m doing good with 100percentpure.com and bubbleandbee.com. They both have good products, I can&#x27;t stand the castor oil, I don&#x27;t even know why they put this in there and also comfrey root. My body can&#x27;t take all of this stuff. I have to go simple. But I do like lather. Don&#x27;t go for the hydrating body wash at 100% if you like suds, because you won&#x27;t get anything but foam and that wasn&#x27;t enough for me but it did offer an overall good natural product without anything harmful.</li>
    <li> Coconut papaya is my FAVORITE Nubian Heritage soap hand down! It is very moisturizing and softening. It smells amazing and my boyfriend raves about how good I smell when I use it. I&#x27;ve tried it on my face but I breakout easily and have oily skin so I can only use it in the winter when my face is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey but the bar is huge and it lasts me a very long time.</li>
    <li> My 2 daughters and myself have just started using this soap. Results were visible during the first week. Skins look clearer and brighter and feel much softer. Will definitely order more.  HIGHLY RECOMENDED</li>
    <li> I love the smell of coconut. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized and clean. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I really, truly love this soap and everything about Nubian Heritage! If you are looking for a natural skin product choose Nubian Heritage. Makes your skin smell good and feel soft!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and this year it has been especially dry. I&#x27;m always trying to find a soap I can use in the shower that is moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and doesn&#x27;t melt. This soap is wonderful! It is very moisturizing, I&#x27;ve had no break outs, and it&#x27;s lasting a very long time. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My Spouse&#x27;s favorite soap.  I like it, but think Mango is better, both are great on skin.</li>
    <li> We love all of Nubia&#x27;s soaps.  They are creamy and last a long time with nice scents and natural ingredients.  I always keep a stock of them in various scents.</li>
    <li> I purchased the lotion from Nubian Heritage and loved it so I decided to try the soap. I love the soap too. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it soft.</li>
    <li> I use this soap in particular to wash my face makeup off before I remove my eye makeup completely. Does a great job as it foams up a lot while exfoliates at the same time. Also not as drying as other coconut soaps I&#x27;ve used but this has really great ingredients in it. I also use this as my daily soap for showering and washing my hands, very moisturizing and it has a lovely scent. Will be using this soap as long as it doesn&#x27;t discontinue, and I would definitely recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much. It&#x27;s creamy, smooth, and smells great. Coconut has so many benefits for the human body... both inside and out... so I&#x27;m glad that I get to rub coconut (and Papaya and Vanilla) all over my skin my the shower! :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really great for my dry skin, and I use this on my face too, and it&#x27;s really helped a lot with my complexion. ^^</li>
    <li> It gets me clean, but it isn&#x27;t what I was hoping for. I wanted something to help reduce the amount of pigmentation I have over my body due to acne scars. Unfortunately, I lack the fortitude to stand in the shower without the water running so that the chemicals have time to take effect. It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;m not what would be considered a fan.</li>
    <li> Great price and came in good time. I love using all natural products and this one makes my skin so soft and smells so good...</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and leaves skin baby soft!!! I love this brand of soaps because they are not processed with tons of chemicals like other brands which can be deleterious to ones skin.</li>
    <li> Loved you at first, your lather &amp; scent were magnanimous but you left orange stains all over my tub. I assume it&#x27;s the papaya but i threw in the towel &amp; now only use it in the kitchen where the sink is stainless steel. I don&#x27;t need my soap to cause me more work to keep my tub clean - not a fair tradeoff; looked like a crime scene after 10 days of use. Although it may have saved my skin, it cost me more in soft scrub &amp; cleanser with bleach. C minus.</li>
    <li> Great Soap - keeps skin moisturized&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think very nice clean smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More economical than others on the market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even give them as small gifts!</li>
    <li> Great soap, reasonably priced, delivered in a timely manner.  I will continue to buy this soap as long as the price doesn&#x27;t rise too high!!!!</li>
    <li> Luv This Soap!! The shipping was fast and the aroma is excellent!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. There is some coconut shell included for exfoliating I suppose...  Clean, fresh and smells good.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nice smell but it&#x27;s advertise as a brightening soap. So far I see no difference. Will continue to use it and then decide if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t wet it or it wont work</li>
    <li> After reading tons of positive reviews,I bought this product from Vitamin shoppe next to my office and been using this since 3 days. Just after first use i can feel the extreme dryness and burning sensation on my face.I thought the natural ingredients are working on my skin and applied some moisturizing cream to get rid of burning. But even after using for 3 days (2 times a day) I can still feel the extreme burning and drying. May be not for my skin type and this was never happened to me before with any soaps as I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin. I will try this for a couple of days to see if my skin gets used to this soap if not I will stop using this.</li>
    <li> Great smelling soap.. My skin is brighter. I have been using the products for approx 3 weeks. I use once daily followed by the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this soap but it can be drying. It has helped clear up some minor blemishes but a moisturizer must be used in combination.</li>
    <li> Smells great but a Lil hesitant about this product . Not sure if it was the cause of a facial breakout so I discontinued the use . Won&#x27;t be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It smells wonderful and is SO high quality.  I am glad I got two bars! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like having aroma therapy every morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love coconut and what a nice way to start your day!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS AT WALMART AND IT CLEAR MY FACE OMG .. U MUST I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT HAVE ACNE</li>
    <li> Since I fell in love with Lotion by Nubian Heritage, I wanted to try their soap.  I only tried it on my face and it made my face feel very dry...it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting at all.  I was looking for soft and supple but got hard and dry instead.  I don&#x27;t think I will try this on my body since it left my face dry as the desert.  I did not like this soap at all and I do not recommend it because no one wants dry, ashy skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Lifts my makeup and oil on my face instantly.</li>
    <li> This soap smells really good and leaves the skin feeling good as well. It also lasts a long time and I love that.</li>
    <li> Because I am landlocked and a good 18 hrs away from the nearest ocean, I like to take olfactory escapes at least once a day. I belong by the water people! This Coconut &amp; Papaya definitely does the trick without being overpowering. It smells clean and natural. It also provides a creamy lather, and is a great addition to the African Black Soap. I get a good scrub on with the African Black and then I follow up with a light creamy lather of the Coconut &amp; Papaya and for a moment, I feel like I am in an oasis. I&#x27;ll even lather up my legs and use it as a shaving cream and it keeps my very sensative and very dry skin from itching and burning before I can apply lotion. I am very much looking forward to trying their other soaps!</li>
    <li> I brought this thinking, everyone who has acne prone skin does not react the same way. Well, I guess I should have taken the advice from others. I just used this product this morning and I instantly broke out from it. I received small bumps on the side of my face. This only makes things worst because i am trying to get rid of the acne marks and pimples. Yes, I can say it will make it worst. Do not even think this will be diffrent for you, i wish i was not a risk taker. If i wasnt i would not have to take the time to find another solution fot his problem of NEW acne that will leave more marks. UGH!</li>
    <li> I only use &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soap- fare skinned Swed prone to mild dryness from harsh soaps. This is my second fav soap so far. Highly recomend if you enjoy a pleasant refresh fragrance and smooth mild suds. I can even skip after shower moisturizer which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST soap on the entire planet!  Try their shea butter lotion, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nubian soaps overt the years and love how they cleanse leaving my skin soft and refreshed.  The formula I use depends on the season.  So when I saw that  I was ready for a new bar I posted my order and it came very quickly.  I&#x27;ll use this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> This soap smells good enough to eat its natural its makes you feel clean i would buy again alittle costly but you pay for good stuff i would buy again</li>
    <li> I liked it but I think the scent was a bit to soft for me. That is really the only negative thing.</li>
    <li> This soap is luxurious! It bubbles up into a nice lather but doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. The smell is heavenly and tropical. Great product! Very happy.</li>
    <li> i ONLY HAVE GIVEN IT 3 STARS BECAUSE I&#x27;VE ONLY USED 3 X.  I LIKE THE SMELL AND MY SKIN DOESN&#x27;T FEEL ALL TIGHT AND DRY AFTER I USE IT, SO WE&#x27;LL SEE HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT WITH MORE CONSISTENT USE.</li>
    <li> I first tried the black soap from this line and it dried out my skin. THe lemon grass soap didn&#x27;t do anything for me. But this one made a tremendous difference, particularly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels ALOT smoother and softer and post acne scars are fading!!! What more could I ask for? Great things come in small packages indeed :)</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it smells great and made my skin soft, fresh and even toned. I haven&#x27;t used that much after, I became so busy but will definitely get back on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my face to get rid of the dry patches an marks left by pimples..it only made my face break out more &amp; oily..so now I just use it on my body.</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been buying coconut soap for years because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but I&#x27;ve never happened upon this company and this particular bar of coconut soap.  The bar is HUGE according to soap standards and very very creamy and wonderful smelling.  I have used it many times a day and it never dries my skin out.  I have to wash my hands more often than normal, taking care of my disabled husband and his diabetic needs, and my skin is very soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out, even after washing my hands a dozen times a day.  Will buy this particular brand again.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> made my skin smell so good and soft i even use it on my 2 yr old. cant wait to try the other scents.</li>
    <li> Helps out great with dry skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft and smooth. this soap smells good and light feeling not sticky...its also good to wash your hair with.....what a buy</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft and pretty! It keeps my acne under control! I absolutely love the smell! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Same as any other soap. Didn&#x27;t do any negative nor any positive things to my skin. The smell is fine, but thats about it. It&#x27;s an okay soap.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work on me, but may work on others. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> I quite frankly don&#x27;t see much skin lightening taking place. But, it does smell good &amp; it does rid the skin of oils...that is evident with the dry skin your left with after showering. My cocoa butter lotion cures that dryness just fine for me though, so that&#x27;s not a dealbreaker for me. I will continue using in conjunction with my other soap...perhaps it&#x27;s too soon to see much result (been using for maybe 2-3 months)</li>
    <li> This soap is sooo softening on the skin and the smell is incredible! It is made from the coconut, instead of chemicals. It lathers like crazy and the smell lasts all day. It has a fruity/coconut scent. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is a very smooth soap with great lather potential.  I love it on my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Was not my kind of soap. I thought I&#x27;d like it, but just didn&#x27;t. I tried it a few times, then ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because it is too harsh for my face. Most bar soaps are, but I was hoping this would be better. Guess I have very sensitive skin. I do like this soap for the rest of my body though, no issues there. Just don&#x27;t use it on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend Alpen Secrets Fragrance Free Goat Milk Soap. It&#x27;s more mild and a lot cheaper too! You can find it here: http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00469O4OO</li>
    <li> Love this soap, does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Product isn&#x27;t like regular soap. But it&#x27;s vegan so I like it</li>
    <li> This soap by Nubian is fantastic - so bubbly and foaming and smooth! Rinses&lt;br /&gt;cleanly and leaves my skin nice and soft. Highly recommend it. Ooops, if I do&lt;br /&gt;that it will be even harder to find :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, telling the truth - it really is supreme.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best soap I have used.  Great fragrance and leaves your skin feeling soft.  I would certainly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> A+ transaction!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot because it does the basic job of cleaning my face. It didn&#x27;t feel super moisturized after I used it though. I also didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin tone or any of the scars I had on my face. I guess maybe I need to use it for longer than a few weeks to notice even a small difference? I think it might have made me break out a little too...so be wary of that.</li>
    <li> The soap softened my skin, and I love the way it smells. I only used the soap about three times, but so far I do  like it. I think it would have a good impact on my skin considering coconut is pretty good overall. I would probably purchase it again if I&#x27;m impressed with the results after using it for a while.</li>
    <li> I really picked this soap out because I absolutely LOVED the smell.  Calendula, Citrus Oils, Flower based Oils, etc actually make me a bit nauseous.  For some reason, the papaya based ingredient meshed well with the Coconut Oil.  I love the feel of the soap and how well it foams and how well it soothes. BUT there is ONE MAJOR PROBLEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT clean my B.O. ESPECIALLY under the armpit area.  Tonight, I literally scrubbed four times under each armpit AND i can still smell the faint smell of B.O. as I type this right now.  To be fair, perhaps this soap was ONLY designed as a facial or some type of body soap for women (I&#x27;m a guy) OR perhaps just my body chemistry does NOT mesh well with the soap.  Regardless, the soap is pretty useless at eliminating my own body odor.  At this point, I have it sitting there in the bathroom as a deodorizer.  Such a shame because It had so much potential.</li>
    <li> I mainly used this bar for my arms and back , and legs, its is amazing.  For my face , it was quite drying, but if felt smooth, but gave me a few acne  pop ups so  I discontinued this for now on  my face. However  for everything else, amazing, beautiful and makes skin feel like  soft rose petals.  You cant got wrong.  My skin for my face, had a  different reaction, so i needed to  take a break from it,.</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;m african so I&#x27;m used to all different types of smell. But this s*** right here? NAH. It probably smells like a coconut more then papaya. I&#x27;ve used so many different coconut products and have had no problems with the scent but this stuff makes me wanna throw up. I still use it on my skin cause I don&#x27;t want to waste it lol. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now after reading reviews, and watching YouTube videos. So far I would say it&#x27;s not very moisturizing cause my skin still feels kind of rough after my showers. The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long either. It might linger in your bathroom for a few minutes but that&#x27;s it. I had a breakout on my face after applying either this, or the Raw Infused shea butter with coconut and papaya so I&#x27;m not applying this on my face anymore. I&#x27;m going to be trying all the soaps and lotions on the Nubian Heritage line. So far, I will not be purchasing the coconut and papaya soap again unless I see a significant difference in my skin after the bar soap is gone. I would say I don&#x27;t necessarily have problem skin. Just my stomach and back is darker than my body so I&#x27;m trying to even it out.. Might do an update if I see any differences in my skin..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. It smells so good and it leaves my skin with a healthy glow. It&#x27;s also lightening up my acne scars, slowly. Best soap I&#x27;ve tried yet and will continue to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot because my skin feels really clean, but not totally stripped after using it. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have acne prone combination skin. After I wash my face all of the oil is gone and my skin is soft. I cut it in half to make it last longer and I&#x27;m still using the first half as of November 24, 2012. So at this rate it will last me a good while. I recommend this soap for sure. Very nice product.</li>
