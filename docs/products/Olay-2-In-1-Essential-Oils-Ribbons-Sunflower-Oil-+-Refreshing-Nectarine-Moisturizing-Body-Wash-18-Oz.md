      <li>I love the fragrance</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful; it&#x27;s very juicy and fresh.</li>
      <li>Now the price is even better than it was in the store.  </li>
      <li>Love the product and will order again.</li>
      <li>I was glad to be able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>nice wash that has a really nice texture and really does leave you skin feeling nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>, it is light and not too flowery like some.</li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift for my partner, I find myself also using it and enjoy it, and she enjoys the way it makes me smell.  </li>
      <li>The scent is amazing and it does really soften up my skin.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s at a very good price compared to other Olay body washes.</li>
      <li>I bought the one with almond oil in it at first but couldn&#x27;t find it when I needed more body wash and couldn&#x27;t get to the store by the time I needed it.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells nice, washes off easily, and does not dry out skin.  </li>
      <li>Nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t even irrate me either.</li>
      <li>With the tiniest amount it makes so much lathery, delicious-smelling suds, that leave your skin silky smooth after your indulgent shower!  </li>
      <li>I also am a bit of a night owl, and am often showering in the wee hours of the morning; the Olay wash is great for times when, let&#x27;s be honest, you&#x27;re just too lazy to do the whole bath time rigmarole.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be lucky if this thing even lasts two weeks.</li>
      <li>I was only able to purchase one at the time, but now I need to purchase more.</li>
      <li>I have recently purchased several Olay products for her that I have used myself and have found myself quite impressed with the products from Olay.  </li>
      <li>I love this body wash, but I was ripped off by the 3rd party vendor.  </li>
      <li>Smooth soft skin and rinses off well.</li>
      <li>It will probably give me cancer someday, but I love the Oil of Olay ribbons products, especially this scent.  </li>
      <li>leaves skin soft and smooth</li>
      <li>Enter the Olay 2-In-1 Essential Oils Ribbons Sunflower Oil + Refreshing Nectarine body wash, and my problem is solved.</li>
      <li>I will be sure not to purchase this in the future.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin soft I do feel clean</li>
      <li>Will certainly buy again.  </li>
      <li>Large container holds a lot of lotion.</li>
      <li>So much so that I don&#x27;t really need to put lotion on my arms and legs like I used to do.</li>
      <li>it has so much oil in them</li>
      <li>This series of soaps feels very moisturizing when you use it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to feel clean but not with this one I love it.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal because I take two baths a day, and I&#x27;m not out digging ditches, so I&#x27;m not generally too grubby.</li>
      <li>I demanded a full refund immediately and only after threatening to take them to the BBB</li>
      <li>The main test was to see if my bf was going to try it, which he almost didn&#x27;t (\\&quot;That looks so girly\\&quot;...).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice body wash, but it&#x27;s not too different from other washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Haha might sound a bit cheesy, but seriously, I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the skin feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin very soft and smelling like Sunflower &amp; peaches.</li>
      <li>but it was only one for a much higher price than I paid for two</li>
      <li>and they said it makes their skin soft..</li>
      <li>They leave your skin so soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I thought that with the &amp;#34;essential ribbons&amp;#34; and sunflower oil it would make my skin really, really soft.</li>
      <li>I love this soap but amazon&#x27;s price is ridiculous.</li>
      <li>Only takes a little dot to complete a full wash.</li>
      <li>They are already soft enough when I get out that I don&#x27;t need them.</li>
      <li>You can only purchase this fragance online directly from the manufacturer or drugstore websites.  </li>
      <li>All in all, this wash is nice occasionally, and I would repurchase it, but for me, it is too heavy for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It does leave a film on your loofa, as well as the tub; but it also leaves a very nice veil of moisture on your skin, so that aspect isn&#x27;t all bad.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this especially during the winter time when your skin is being sucked dry!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even as a guy, I must admit how great this feels and smells on my skin in the shower.  Purchased as a gift for my partner, I find myself also using it and enjoy it, and she enjoys the way it makes me smell.  I have recently purchased several Olay products for her that I have used myself and have found myself quite impressed with the products from Olay.  I would recommend this lotions for guys or girls.  It leaves the skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells nice, washes off easily, and does not dry out skin.  Large container holds a lot of lotion.</li>
    <li> It will probably give me cancer someday, but I love the Oil of Olay ribbons products, especially this scent.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> GOOD FRAGRANCE AND SILKY SMOOTH FEELING TO MY SKIN AND VERYGOOD FOR THE SHOWER. .GOOD PRODUCT AND I AM GETTING A SUPPLY EVERY MONTH. LOVE AMAZON AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER</li>
    <li> I get in a hurry and sometimes forget to put lotion on after my shower! This is a great 2 in 1 that I don&#x27;t worry about moisturizing immediately after the shower!</li>
    <li> smells so good.  love o&#x27;lay.  leaves skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I bought the one with almond oil in it at first but couldn&#x27;t find it when I needed more body wash and couldn&#x27;t get to the store by the time I needed it. Found this and got it. I don&#x27;t like switching body washes since I have senstitve skin but I am glad I got this one. The scent is amazing and it does really soften up my skin. So much so that I don&#x27;t really need to put lotion on my arms and legs like I used to do. They are already soft enough when I get out that I don&#x27;t need them. I think the sunflower oil is a great addition to my skin. Nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t even irrate me either.</li>
    <li> Olay is the best soap i have used to date. I have used multiple scents, but this is on of my preferable ones.</li>
    <li> SO good!  With the tiniest amount it makes so much lathery, delicious-smelling suds, that leave your skin silky smooth after your indulgent shower!  Haha might sound a bit cheesy, but seriously, I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s my third buy already, and I will definitely continue buying it.  Also, it&#x27;s at a very good price compared to other Olay body washes.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feel. Smooth soft skin and rinses off well. Only takes a little dot to complete a full wash.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash, but I was ripped off by the 3rd party vendor.  They charged me $11 per bottle and the wash is only $3 - $4 in the store.  PLUS they charged me $50 for STANDARD SHIPPING!!!!!!!!!!!  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I ordered body wash from a lighting company, but I wanted the body wash so badly (can barely find in the stores).  Spent almost $100 on 3 bottles!!!!!!!!  I demanded a full refund immediately and only after threatening to take them to the BBB did I finally get a refund.</li>
    <li> nice wash that has a really nice texture and really does leave you skin feeling nice and soft.  I highly recommend this especially during the winter time when your skin is being sucked dry!</li>
    <li> This body wash smells very nice. I thought that with the &amp;#34;essential ribbons&amp;#34; and sunflower oil it would make my skin really, really soft. I don&#x27;t think it did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice body wash, but it&#x27;s not too different from other washes I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m always trying to find a wash that will make my skin softer than Caress Silk, but this one couldn&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This series of soaps feels very moisturizing when you use it.  I especially like the smell of this one, it is light and not too flowery like some.</li>
    <li> This is a really great body wash. It leaves your skin soft and a little soap goes a long way with a loofah sponge. Lathers very nicely and the scent isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
    <li> Although I really love the fragrance, I cannot tolerate the consistency of this product. I will be sure not to purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered this based on a blogger&#x27;s review of the product. She loved the smell, the creaminess of it, and how well it washed off. I concur on all counts. The main test was to see if my bf was going to try it, which he almost didn&#x27;t (\\&quot;That looks so girly\\&quot;...). Then I made him sniff it. He looked at me curiously then didn&#x27;t say anything about it. Later, when I went to brush my teeth, I caught him singing in the shower, all lathered up. \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell? Why are you so happy?\\&quot; I asked. I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use it before he did. I&#x27;ll be lucky if this thing even lasts two weeks. Go figure.</li>
    <li> I love this soap but amazon&#x27;s price is ridiculous. Target sells it for $4.99.</li>
    <li> Discovered this @ a friends house, when spending the weekend.... Got back  home and couldn&#x27;t find it in my stores anywhere.  I was glad to be able to find it on Amazon.  I love the fragrance, I love the moisturizing, I haven&#x27;t had to use extra lotion awesome!</li>
    <li> Lovely smell and great product.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash quite a lot, in its place. If you&#x27;re looking for a body wash that will leave you feeling \\&quot;squeaky clean,\\&quot; this isn&#x27;t it. If you are covered in dirt and grime, this isn&#x27;t the wash you&#x27;ll be reaching for. For this reason, when I use this wash, I will pre-wash areas of my body with bar soap. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal because I take two baths a day, and I&#x27;m not out digging ditches, so I&#x27;m not generally too grubby. It does leave a film on your loofa, as well as the tub; but it also leaves a very nice veil of moisture on your skin, so that aspect isn&#x27;t all bad. I like to use this when I wash my hair, or when I&#x27;m too lazy to apply lotion. I have long, curly, dry hair, and I have to get my products in it while it&#x27;s sopping wet; if my hair dries too much, it&#x27;s difficult to distribute my products through it. I feel the same way about body lotion; if I don&#x27;t apply my lotion while my skin is still damp, it seems to just sit on the surface in a greasy film. This conundrum leaves me with the choice of whether to deal with my hair, or apply lotion; my hair always wins out, and my skin suffers. Enter the Olay 2-In-1 Essential Oils Ribbons Sunflower Oil + Refreshing Nectarine body wash, and my problem is solved. This wash is moisturizing enough that when I wash my hair, skipping the step of applying a moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave me with nasty, dry-skin consequences. I also am a bit of a night owl, and am often showering in the wee hours of the morning; the Olay wash is great for times when, let&#x27;s be honest, you&#x27;re just too lazy to do the whole bath time rigmarole. The scent is wonderful; it&#x27;s very juicy and fresh. All in all, this wash is nice occasionally, and I would repurchase it, but for me, it is too heavy for everyday use.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED  PRODUCT &#x3D; SO THICK AND HEAVY COULD NOT EXTRACT  FROM CONTAINER.  DEFINITELY  NOT  THE EXPECTED QUALITY PRODUCT  FROM  OLAY.  DO  NOT  RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Love oil of Olay products</li>
    <li> Pleasant! Personally I liked this product, might not be for others.</li>
    <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This made me and my bathroom smell devine! It makes your skin soft I do feel clean I know that with some of the body washes it has so much oil in them it&#x27;s hard to feel clean but not with this one I love it.</li>
    <li> Very creamy, best smelling body wash I&#x27;ve had in a while. Leaves my skin very soft and smelling like Sunflower &amp; peaches.</li>
    <li> I choice to give this product 5-stars because the scent is not over bearing, it leaves your skin feeling very smooth and the fragrance is no overbearing.</li>
    <li> I gave some of the Sunflower oil kind to my sister in-law and mom. I thought it smelled great and they said it makes their skin soft..everybody won on this one.</li>
    <li> This was a good variant of body ribbons. Will certainly buy again.  I hope to get more variations and great prices as wwll</li>
    <li> I found this product to be extremely over priced and I returned it I miss read the advertisement I thought it came in a package of 2 which I had previously purchased but it was only one for a much higher price than I paid for two</li>
    <li> My boyfriend actually purchased this for me over a year ago.  I continued to use this time and time again, until the store stopped selling them in-store.  The smell is wonderful, it leaves you and your bathroom smelling heavenly!  The ribbons are even an added addition.  They leave your skin so soft to the touch.  It makes you want to shower all day!  You can only purchase this fragance online directly from the manufacturer or drugstore websites.  outrageous. Now the price is even better than it was in the store.  I was only able to purchase one at the time, but now I need to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom just because of the reviews, and now I need to keep buying it because she says is one of the best she has ever used.</li>
    <li> AMAZING body wash!!! Leaves my skin soooooo soft and smells amazing!! A MUST in every girls shower! :)</li>
    <li> Enjoying it!!  Would purchase again.</li>
