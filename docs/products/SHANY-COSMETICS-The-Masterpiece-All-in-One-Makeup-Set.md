      <li>The colors are nicely pigmented and stays put for hours.</li>
      <li>I like to use the blush as eyeshadow sometimes, and they work nicely too.</li>
      <li>I really love this product because the colors are amazing, they arent chalky.</li>
      <li>I also love the pigmentation of these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a make up purist, but I love to try everything once.</li>
      <li>And I love it</li>
      <li>The whole set is good though the plastic covers are not that appreciative though.</li>
      <li>the quality is ok</li>
      <li>I will probably order again when I run out:)</li>
      <li>but I still love it...</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>and I love this mini make up set.</li>
      <li>Glad I did.</li>
      <li>The palettes are also easy to put away just put it back inside the box stack it perfectly.</li>
      <li>Beautiful textures and natural colours.</li>
      <li>It has both creme and powder , so you can do a full face and set it after!</li>
      <li>The blushes are all highly pigmented and the concealers are also good.</li>
      <li>The quality is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>The powders go on smooth and the creams are moist and dewy.</li>
      <li>The foundations and concealers are creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly pigmented the colors are amazing</li>
      <li>I just like to use more cream-based makeup to contour and this particular palette is powder.</li>
      <li>The concealers are nice and thick, and that&#x27;s a good thing for coverage.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely everything in more the quality is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I am in love with Shany Cosmetics so far!!</li>
      <li>ok, I only use the blushes and I only use 2 blushes lol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant and may wear off after some breathing time.</li>
      <li>The contour palette will be a nice back up for when I run out of the cream foundation and concealers.</li>
      <li>although this would be fun for people looking to start doing pro makeup</li>
      <li>Was shipped super fast!</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful and the pigments are very rich, so a little will go a long way.</li>
      <li>I received my order today, the colors are beautiful, the concealer colors are dense and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Overall I am pleased with what I received and would order again when I run out.</li>
      <li>The make up offered lots of variety for skin tones, and with high lighting and contouring powders I should never NOT have the right shade.</li>
      <li>Over all I am still happy with my purchase, this is the first time any powder SHANY products have come to me broken.</li>
      <li>I was especially grateful for the styrofoam covering of the product and the magnet for easy opening and closing.</li>
      <li>I love that it has almost all the essentials in one - minus of course</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>so better be careful in handling it if you want to keep it.</li>
      <li>The price is just so reasonable</li>
      <li>and I know I&#x27;ll order again - as gifts very soon</li>
      <li>The blushes are beautiful only because you need a small amount, unlike the concealers and foundations.</li>
      <li>The colors are always vibrant and luxurious.</li>
      <li>The colors are as vibrant as seen in picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a normal plastic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a photographer who offers on location or salon hair and make up with my high school senior packages.  </li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d have the basic ones first.</li>
      <li>absolutelly love it, concealers work great, base and powder base are good (would like more shades), i would like a rosier/peacher less fuscia blushes</li>
      <li>I did not expect much for the price, but my golly, this is probably the only brand I will ever need.</li>
      <li>The sizes of the make up are smaller than I thought but aside from that I really did like the product.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Shany&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Very pigmentet long stay make up set</li>
      <li>the blushes are pigmented very pretty little goes a long way</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product! Was shipped super fast! Great colors, I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter received this as a gift and loved the color selections. Very good price for the amount of make up in the kit. This is a great gift for someone who enjoys a variety of colors, and practicing blending colors together.</li>
    <li> ok, I only use the blushes and I only use 2 blushes lol. the quality is ok but I think its best to just buy quality products and stop being cheap. although this would be fun for people looking to start doing pro makeup but I would just save up and go to Sephora..........&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t fall into the hype</li>
    <li> I really love this product because the colors are amazing, they arent chalky. I thought it would too small but it is not, the size its perfect! I fell in love with the all in one, its perfect to carry on!</li>
    <li> i use it for makeup artistry school and it works great!</li>
    <li> The creams and highlight powders are awful. Super cakey and terrible pigment. The blushes are beautiful only because you need a small amount, unlike the concealers and foundations. Save your money and just buy the blushes separate.</li>
    <li> I had no issues with this purchase. Shipping was not a problem and the product came in very good condition. Everything was intact and sealed properly. The colors are as vibrant as seen in picture.</li>
    <li> Received and unpacked this today. The quality is pretty nice. The blushes have a semi heavy scent to them, but that may be from them being boxed and plastic wrapped. It&#x27;s not unpleasant and may wear off after some breathing time. The colors are beautiful and the pigments are very rich, so a little will go a long way. The foundations and concealers are creamy and smooth. The contour palette will be a nice back up for when I run out of the cream foundation and concealers. I just like to use more cream-based makeup to contour and this particular palette is powder. Overall I am pleased with what I received and would order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I am a freelance MUA and I bought this for a beginner friend of mine and she likes it! it is not amazing quality, but it is complete with all the basics for all skin tones and can be used for highlight and contour too! It has both creme and powder , so you can do a full face and set it after!</li>
    <li> I received the mini masterpiece makeup kit  as a birthday gift! And I love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Beautiful textures and natural colours. I use it even for bridal makeup. It&#x27;s a bit small but look at the price!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The application goes on smoothly, the colors are very nice and can be used for any colored skin! The only cons i would say is that i wish on the trays they say what each product is (concealer or blush ect) or the inteneded use and wish the size was bigger. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends and family. (:</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase! Love how the makeup looks so flawless on me and lasts longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I will probably order again when I run out:)</li>
    <li> I received my order today, the colors are beautiful, the concealer colors are dense and long lasting. I can&#x27;t believe the quality and the price. I will be reordering and I will be a customer. Fantastic! Mac who????</li>
    <li> absolutelly love it, concealers work great, base and powder base are good (would like more shades), i would like a rosier/peacher less fuscia blushes but they are just like the pic so no complains</li>
    <li> Im from another country and the palettes came melted.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to have a wonderful kit of my own and I love this mini make up set. I don&#x27;t know a lot about makeup so I thought I&#x27;d have the basic ones first. I love that it has almost all the essentials in one - minus of course the lipstick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful colors, especially love the concealer palette and blush palettes. They were perfect. I also love the pigmentation of these. So beautiful. The palettes are also easy to put away just put it back inside the box stack it perfectly. The price is just so reasonable and I know I&#x27;ll order again - as gifts very soon I am in love with Shany Cosmetics so far!!</li>
    <li> I received this set a day earlier than expected. The blushes are all highly pigmented and the concealers are also good. The whole set is good though the plastic covers are not that appreciative though. It&#x27;s just a normal plastic so better be careful in handling it if you want to keep it.

    <li> Fast shipping and I love this product!! It is smaller than what I expected but it&#x27;s definitely everything in more the quality is outstanding. It&#x27;s highly pigmented the colors are amazing</li>
    <li> On December 10, I ordered the Shany Cosmetics mini kit for my younger sister as a Christmas gift. I received my order today and it was absolutely perfect. It appears the same way as shown on the website. I was especially grateful for the styrofoam covering of the product and the magnet for easy opening and closing. This will be the best Christmas ever, thank you Shany Cosmetics! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kiara H.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Shany&#x27;s products. I did not expect much for the price, but my golly, this is probably the only brand I will ever need. The colors are nicely pigmented and stays put for hours. No need for a primer. I like to use the blush as eyeshadow sometimes, and they work nicely too. The concealers are nice and thick, and that&#x27;s a good thing for coverage. SO many shades to pick from too! Feeling bronzy in the summer? Use the browner shades. Feeling rosy during your paler winter skin? Use the pinks!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend&#x27;s daughter who is a makeup artists and loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a photographer who offers on location or salon hair and make up with my high school senior packages.  I needed a simple, on the go kit with plenty of option.&lt;br /&gt;I was super impressed with the packaging, and love the compact size of this kit.  The make up offered lots of variety for skin tones, and with high lighting and contouring powders I should never NOT have the right shade. Plenty of blush colors that can act as eyeshadows as well.  I&#x27;m not a make up purist, but I love to try everything once. Glad I did. Great investment, and looks gorgeous on my girls :)&lt;br /&gt;The only thing, now I wished I would&#x27;ve spent the extra $20 and got the eye and lip palettes too!!</li>
    <li> The kit is great n the blushes are pigmented very pretty little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love SHANY Cosmetics! The colors are always vibrant and luxurious. The powders go on smooth and the creams are moist and dewy. I totally recommend for all skin tones and types!</li>
    <li> I bought this product the packaging was good but the products weren&#x27;t labeled and the concealer / color corrector my shade was hard to mix because most of them seem to have a white base rather than a golden or yellow undertone but I still love it... Its jys not for ppl with yellow undertones</li>
    <li> One pallet of blushes was smashed when I received it. Over all I am still happy with my purchase, this is the first time any powder SHANY products have come to me broken. This is a compact way to take products with you when travelling.</li>
    <li> Very pigmentet long stay make up set good cover cobcealer 😁😁😁😁</li>
