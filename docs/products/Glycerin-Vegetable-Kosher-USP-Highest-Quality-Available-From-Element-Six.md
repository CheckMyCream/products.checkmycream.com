    <li> Excellent quality vegetable glycerin! Perfect! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good experience. I&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
    <li> Good price. Use this to vape.</li>
    <li> this is a little known substance that is great for your skin;  glycerin is a humectant.  it holds the moisture on your skin.  i mix this with rosewater and my skin is doing great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get all other ingredients and make my own lotions!</li>
    <li> This vegetable glycerin is reasonably priced but it caused me to have an allergic reaction and is also very sweet compared to essential depots brand. I made e liquid with this brand and experienced such dry eyes and throat from this vegetable glycerin I had to go to the urgent care. I switched over to essential depot and now everything is fine. I would not buy this brand again and the bottle just sits in my closet.</li>
    <li> I used to make Uberlather. It works fine..</li>
    <li> Great I use as an e liquid additive. Love not smoking.......</li>
    <li> used for vaping, its good but a little sweet</li>
    <li> Consumers must be careful when buying glycerin for consumption. Not all glycerol products are meant to be ingested. This company seems to have covered all of the bases.</li>
    <li> I was using some awful VG that was not made for ecigs &amp; it tasted horrible. This is completely different. No bad taste at all, kinda sweet. I like to thicken &amp; dilute the juice I use for dripping with a RDA. Also works great for saturating your wicks when changing. Keeps them put, like glue. Very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product for whatever you want to use it for. I think its better than stuff I was paying way more for.</li>
    <li> Good product. Using to make sensory bottles for my classroom. Just a few drops needed, but reasonably priced product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making homemade beauty products. Good size and easy to pour.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product along with Soda Bottle Preforms and Caps (30/pk) for long term freezer storage of Brewers yeast.</li>
    <li> this glycerin makes a good body wash for the shower.  whether mixed with essential oils or castille soap</li>
    <li> Awesome for vape flavors.</li>
    <li> Use for e-juice good stuff</li>
