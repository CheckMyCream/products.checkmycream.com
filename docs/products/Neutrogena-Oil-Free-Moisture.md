      <li>This pleasant, light scent is so refreshing in the morning.  </li>

      <li>Because this is easy to use, and effective, I&#x27;ll probably buy it, but I&#x27;d be more inclined to do so, and would give it five stars, if Johnson &amp; Johnson came out with an unscented version.</li>
      <li>so sure if it is as acne fighting as it claims to be</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased as punch.</li>
      <li>I  love the face wash too</li>
      <li>I liked the light grapefruit scent that this lotion has when you apply it to your skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome, 10/10, would totally recommend it!</li>
      <li>More times than not, the ones my girls chose are Neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>Besides using it on my face I&#x27;ve used it on the top of my hands.</li>
      <li>It has a nice and light scent that I like.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>My skin looks clearer and more even-toned.</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d find a better moisturizer than my Epicuren probiotic lotion.</li>
      <li>Why scent this product with anything at all, since fragrance is one of the top ingredients for causing skin allergies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>I travel a lot and being able to lock my face wash and lotions before throwing them into my luggage</li>
      <li>Most make my skin oily and clog my pores.</li>
      <li>but otherwise I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, it seems as though this product is working for a lot of people but as with most skincare products, what works for one person won&#x27;t work for all.  </li>
      <li>And it smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>I was able to apply my foundation easily, over the top of this.  </li>
      <li>The first morning I tried it, I walked out into the kitchen and instead of \\&quot;Good morning\\</li>
      <li>smell is grapefruit and OK, but a bit too chemical and strong.  </li>
      <li>and then i took note and found that on me the smell is fresh and pleasant and quickly disappears and does not interfere with any fragrance i may</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy/greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to use from pump bottle and hasn&#x27;t made me break out.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the salicylic acid gel I have, this moisturizer is so easy and convenient to use.</li>
      <li>It’s easy to apply and goes on with easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it looks like I have dandruff in my eyebrows sometimes and skin flakes fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer at a decent price, go for this Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product and plan on ordering again.</li>
      <li>It is strong and it lingers.</li>
      <li>Because the smell is too strong</li>
      <li>Absorbed into skin very easily.  </li>
      <li>The scent of pink grapefruit is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>I like the pump dispenser this comes in, very easy to pick up and get just the right amount without the hassle of removing a cap, tip over and squeeze.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, and I like how quickly it dries.</li>
      <li>Oil Free</li>
      <li>/&gt;Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin is actually free of pimples- not</li>
      <li>It does smell is fantastic though.</li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not oily.</li>
      <li>It feels light on my skin, alone or under makeup.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Also this product has certainly made the backs of my hands look better and feel softer.</li>
      <li>Secondly, this lotion made my skin feel great the first day I used it</li>
      <li>She liked the scent of the lotion and it seemed to help clear up her skin.  </li>
      <li>It provides a mild exfoliation that keeps the pores clean.</li>
      <li>I went in fully aware that this is a very mild treatment.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, without leaving a greasy shine.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena products because of their high quality and because they deliver on their promises.</li>
      <li>thing that I enjoy about this moisturizer is that it is oil-free, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and for the most part, when I came back from vacation from Tokyo, because of the sweets/chocolate I ate, I had a little breakout and surprisingly, as I do use moisturizer, having opted with this, it didn&#x27;t increase the acne and if anything, it made my skin feeling clean and</li>
      <li>once a day, usually, as I never remember to do more than that) and my chin is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells so good. It goes on light and isn&#x27;t that thick . I really like it very moisturizing without being oily.</li>
    <li> I first used this moisturizer in the UK. Then when I came back to the US I HAD to buy it! I have not come across any other moisturizer like this one. The texture is so creamy and relaxing, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, and I feel it moisturizing my face from the moment I put it on! This is a produce I&#x27;ll use for an eternity.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer!  Light, not at all greasy, and has really helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s skin!  Love Neutrogena products and this another good one.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like that this moisturizer is made specifically for skin that has acne problems.  For some reason, I have an impossible time explaining to my teenager that he needs to use cleanser on his face even when he doesn’t have a breakout.  He thinks the shower face wash should be sufficient.  Now try explaining to said male teenager why he needs to use a moisturizer if it doesn’t smell like Axe or Woods or Trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I said so…</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only been using this moisturizer erratically for about three weeks, I&#x27;ve seen results. My pores are smaller, and whiteheads and blackheads are disappearing. My skin looks clearer and more even-toned. It moisturizes my skin and makes it soft without making it feel oily or look shiny. In fact, it gives my face a nice, matte finish.  Compared to the salicylic acid gel I have, this moisturizer is so easy and convenient to use. Just apply it to your skin morning and night after washing, or anytime during the day. With either using it once a day, or several times a day, I&#x27;ve had no redness, flaking or peeling. It spreads easily, so not a lot is needed; I do have a tendency to use too much. From how much is left in the bottle, I&#x27;m guessing that I would go through about three of these in a year.  I would recommend this highly except for the smell. I&#x27;ve gotten sort of used to it, and it does fade eventually, but, ooh, I don&#x27;t like it. Knocking one star off for that.  Because this is easy to use, and effective, I&#x27;ll probably buy it, but I&#x27;d be more inclined to do so, and would give it five stars, if Johnson &amp; Johnson came out with an unscented version. To their credit, this product has no artificial colors, and I&#x27;m grateful for that.</li>
    <li> I liked the light grapefruit scent that this lotion has when you apply it to your skin.  The lotion comes in a convenient pump style bottle that you can use in the morning or at night.  Simply wash your face and apply a small amount onto your skin.  I tried this on my own skin and on my daughter.  She has recently started breaking out in one small area along her hair line.  She liked the scent of the lotion and it seemed to help clear up her skin.  I am pleased with the outcome and will continue to purchase it on my own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have true Acne, but rather very oily skin with dry skin in the zone between my eyebrows.  It&#x27;s bad enough it looks like I have dandruff in my eyebrows sometimes and skin flakes fairly easily.  The best thing I&#x27;d found before this was Coppertone sunscreen for faces that was a non-breakout formula, but that didn&#x27;t do anything for the oily skin.  I went in fully aware that this is a very mild treatment.  It has only 0.5% Salicylic acid.  If you have major acne breakouts and can tolerate stronger, you should probably get something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is grapefruit and OK, but a bit too chemical and strong.  I don&#x27;t slather on a lot of it and I still end up feeling like I&#x27;m putting on perfume or aftershave.  However, it tends to have dissipated by the time I get to work.  Not always, but sometimes I got a minor burning sensation when using it.  Sort of if a breeze were blowing on something where you&#x27;d skinned your knee.  It wasn&#x27;t painful, just unpleasant.  Didn&#x27;t happen every time.  As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s satisfactory.  It&#x27;s about the level of power I need for my situation, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Bought it at Target, had to return it. I have very oily acne prone skin, was hoping the salycilic acid would help clear up some small blackheads, made my face insanely shiny and oily looking, did not use it long enough to see if it worked because of the shine. It does smell is fantastic though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this facial moisturizer to clear stubborn acne, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any new break outs in my acne prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and goes on smooth. It wears well under my powder make up. I have a few dry areas that stayed dry and flakey even after using this. It has a nice and light scent that I like. I feel like this moisturizer is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; I have no complaints. I feel it is average.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Neutrogena products.  I like the scent of this lotion but it does make my face a bit greasy.  It goes on smoothly but if I use it in the morning I&#x27;m pretty oily/greasy by the end of the day.  Probably best used at night if you&#x27;ve got naturally oily skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this for several weeks on her face, and she noticed an immediate reduction in the roughness of her skin. She was plagued with those rough little bumps that aren&#x27;t exactly acne but made her feel self-conscious anyway.  This helped almost immediately and she loves it.  The smell is beautiful, as well. I used it myself and I particularly loved the smell.  It&#x27;s not meant for my 40-something skin, but I still like it.  For my daughter, though, it&#x27;s a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great! Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve found haven&#x27;t been for oily or acne prone skin and actually just make it worse. So I resorted to not using any moisturizers at all which isn&#x27;t good for skin balance and also really sucked for the dry patches on my skin. But one day when I was walking through Meijer and spotted this, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. So I bought it on a whim and tested it out on a week where I knew I wasn&#x27;t seeing anyone (God forbid I have a bad breakout and have to see a bunch of people). It worked amazingly! I apply it pretty liberally on the dry patches and a bit on my oily patches and I haven&#x27;t broken out once. It&#x27;s awesome, 10/10, would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really liked how this product moisturized my combination skin, without leaving it feeling greasy.  I&#x27;d tried other acne moisturizers (clean &amp; Clear) and didn&#x27;t like them because stye had a strong smell and bitter taste (if I ate or drank soon after putting it on).  The smell of this product is very pleasant, and no issues of tasting it if eating or drinking soon after. I strongly recommend this product and plan on ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer and helps with my problem acne at the same time.</li>
    <li> Absorbed into skin very easily.  Applying sunscreen over it is not a problem--not thick, uncomfortably, tight, etc.  Scent is wonderful.  It is not greasy which is a very big plus.  Skin is really cleared up--especially forehead.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but can&#x27;t give it a five star rating for two reasons.  First, I really love citrus scents, especially grapefruit, but I found this scent to be a little too artificial and lingering.  Some people might find it acceptable but I find it a bit strong/unpleasant.  Secondly, this lotion made my skin feel great the first day I used it but by day two it was causing quite a bit of noticeable irritation and I&#x27;m currently taking a break from it after 7 days of consecutive use (once a day, morning only).  It caused a few of my minor blemishes to get really &#x27;angry&#x27; looking (bright red and tender bumps - normally my blemishes don&#x27;t turn red and throbbing) and I have a painfully dry patch of skin on my left cheek.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the salicylic acid or some other ingredient that upset my skin.  I suspect it&#x27;s something else since I&#x27;m using a facial wash that also contains salicylic acid and it&#x27;s not having this affect on my skin - everything is going back to normal since I&#x27;ve stopped using the lotion. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it seems as though this product is working for a lot of people but as with most skincare products, what works for one person won&#x27;t work for all.  It would appear this lotion just doesn&#x27;t work well with my chemistry.  The one thing I really love about this product is the package design!!  I really like that you can easily &#x27;lock/unlock&#x27; the pump by twisting the top half ways.  I wish some of my other favorite skincare products would take note and do the same with their pump tops.  I travel a lot and being able to lock my face wash and lotions before throwing them into my luggage gives me a little added sense of security that I won&#x27;t arrive at my destination with everything having oozed out into my bag.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find a better moisturizer than my Epicuren probiotic lotion. This might not replace it 100%, but it&#x27;s a great addition to my skincare routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the grapefruit scent is to DIE for! I love it. I feel prettier already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the back of the bottle, I thought it was a little weird that a moisturizer had potential drying effects, because of the salcylic acid. But I haven&#x27;t experienced that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really bad adult acne, like the big cystic kind that hurts and doesn&#x27;t go away quickly. This lotion cut the healing time of both popped and unpopped zits AT LEAST in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this lotion highly enough. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had adult acne plaguing me for a few months now. This sounded like the perfect solution. It&#x27;s no miracle fix, but it is nice. The grapefruit smell is pleasant, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger. It isn&#x27;t thick and soaks in very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this 1-2 times a day for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m still breaking out. My skin isn&#x27;t better, but it isn&#x27;t worse either. It feels less oily, especially on my forehead and I&#x27;m not having any problems with this being too drying on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice enough moisturizer. Definitely nicer smelling than my plain oil-free facial moisturizer and absorbs quicker. I&#x27;ll probably continue with this moisturizer in the future instead of going back to the old one, but I will have to continue trying to cure my acne with other products.</li>
    <li> Smells like grapefruit and moisturizes very well. I have noticed that I don&#x27;t breakout out how I used to after using this. Love love love.</li>
    <li> I decided to give Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer a try.  And the positive is that it&#x27;s a product that has worked so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I enjoy about this moisturizer is that it is oil-free, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and for the most part, when I came back from vacation from Tokyo, because of the sweets/chocolate I ate, I had a little breakout and surprisingly, as I do use moisturizer, having opted with this, it didn&#x27;t increase the acne and if anything, it made my skin feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for everyone else, to have a moisturizer that is oil-free and it did help with my short acne flare up less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a solid product that I recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, and got it because of the inclusion in the ingredients of a small amount of salicylic acid. At the molecular level, it works on your skin to keep it shedding properly. The smell is GREAT! I usually give my hands a final smell before washing them. :-) I like this stuff so much, I bought a second bottle about a third of the way into my first.</li>
    <li> This uses a somewhat standard acne active ingredient, salicylic acid, which does help many people with acne.  Neutrogena brings it&#x27;s own powerhouse moisturizer along for the ride.  They also know how to make things apply/absorb well and also smell nice (mmm...grapefruit...not sure the pink makes a difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small bottle, the pump does a good amount for you and it will last, while also helping clear up acne.</li>
    <li> First thing I like on this product is the smell,it&#x27;s mild but kinda sweet.its lightweight too,and fast absorbing..&lt;br /&gt;Although I really don&#x27;t think,it&#x27;s gonna work on acne(alone)bse I use it one week and nothing changes.so I ended up buying other acne products on neutrogena...</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s acne moisturizer does what you want such a product to do. It&#x27;s strong enough to tackle acne, but also is a non-greasy moisturizer so that the product won&#x27;t dry out your skin. This lotion has a pleasant light citrus/grapefruit fragrance. It works well on breakouts, or as a whole face moisturizer. Unlike a lot of the salicylic acid products, I&#x27;ve found that this one is non-drying, and I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer at a decent price, go for this Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer.  However, if you&#x27;re really looking to get ready of acne/blackheads/etc., don&#x27;t bother with this one.  It did moisturize very well, it smells great, and I felt it added a nice sheen to the skin after.  However, the actual acne-fighting power is nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, try this as a decently priced moisturizer, nothing else.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works very well without leaving your skin oily. Since my skin is naturally silly, but my forehead is dry, this is the perfect moisturizer for me. I love Neutrogena products because of their high quality and because they deliver on their promises.</li>
    <li> Leaves a sort of film on face that can be rubbed away but i don&#x27;t see that as much of a problem! Smells nice, and i&#x27;ve had less breakouts since using! (doesn&#x27;t help clear breakouts) i would love to buy this again, and i would recommend to anyone with acne prone skin. it even has a handy closing pump lid which i loved! This helps moisturize well too!</li>
    <li> Nice scent , non irritating and skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Living in florida I need sunscreen every day. I like to use it under my makeup as the sun here is killer. This product isn&#x27;t greasy and has a fresh scent.  Easy to use from pump bottle and hasn&#x27;t made me break out.  It also has made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The lotion is nice. I use it under my makeup. I get a nice glide with it. The low rating is due to the fragrance. It is strong and it lingers. I  find that it reminds me of cat pee. I  love the face wash too but.... Ugghh the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using the body wash and the acne wash in this line as well as this and I&#x27;m pleased as punch. They all smell fantastic and don&#x27;t dry out my skin too terribly. This stuff just works so well without causing breakouts. I use it before bed and that seems to be enough to keep soft.</li>
    <li> With three teen girls under one room, acne products are a must. More times than not, the ones my girls chose are Neutrogena products. NEUTROGENA OIL-FREE ACNE MOISTURIZER, PINK GRAPEFRUIT, 4 FLUID OUNCE comes in a easy to dispense container. The sent is pleasant – I liking the smell of grapefruit. It’s easy to apply and goes on with easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Acne Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;• Oil Free&lt;br /&gt;• Pink Grapefruit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Moisturizer. Pink Grapefruit. 4 Fluid Ounces.</li>
    <li> I have yet to meet a Neutrogena product that I did not like. I had high hopes trying out this moisturizer. Yet again, Neutrogena did not disappoint. I have acne prone skin (yes, still. Even in my thirties). So, choosing a moisturizer is a big deal. Most make my skin oily and clog my pores. The ones advertised as acne fighting tend to overdry my skin in some areas and over moisturize in others. Not so with this product. My skin is soft, supple abs I&#x27;m not breaking out. It feels light on my skin, alone or under makeup. And it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Neutrogena products, except for the occasional overly perfumed ones, but I really like the grapefruit scent in this one. It&#x27;s a nice light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy/greasy and absorbs quickly. The scent hangs around for a bit, but you&#x27;re not getting it all day. I like the pump dispenser this comes in, very easy to pick up and get just the right amount without the hassle of removing a cap, tip over and squeeze. As for how it treats the acne? I am a bit old for the teenage variety, but I do get the occasional break out or worse - blackhead! I had a couple of those nasty blackheads the day the product arrived. I slapped some of this one, and they were healing quite nicely the next morning and less pronounced.</li>
    <li> .5% salicylic acid.  Glycerin.  Citrus extract.  I&#x27;ve used all these things for years and nothing has helped.  Stress breakouts are a regular thing for me, and I could never find a soap or a cleanser or a moisturizer or a wipe or anything else that worked, and oh boy, did I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer helps a lot.  I can&#x27;t explain why.  I&#x27;ll never have flawless skin, I&#x27;m sure, but something about this moisturizer is noticeably reducing my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong, a little too strong for me.  But it&#x27;s a pleasant scent, which helps a lot because I&#x27;m going to use it anyway. The first morning I tried it, I walked out into the kitchen and instead of \\&quot;Good morning\\&quot; I heard \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t know we had grapefruit juice,\\&quot; so it isn&#x27;t just me.  Because the smell is too strong I can&#x27;t use it at night, unless I manage to remember a couple of hours before bed.  (I usually don&#x27;t.)  So I&#x27;m using this once a day and still seeing improvement.  And the smell does fade after about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly, so I apply it and wait a few minutes before applying a primer and makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any oiliness or other problems, whether I&#x27;m staying home with no makeup or even loading up with sunscreen before makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser clogs easily, which means that every few days instead of a little moisturizer in the palm of my hand it sprays in an unexpected direction, wherever the clog breaks first.  I apply this before getting dressed now, and if I forget I take my shirt off before applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#x27;s nothing in this moisturizer that I haven&#x27;t tried before, but for some reason this is causing a visible improvement in my complexion.  There are negatives, and if this didn&#x27;t help me I&#x27;d have tossed this in the trash a long time ago.  The smell alone is enough to keep me awake if I apply it at night.  But it promises to clear breakouts, and for me it does, and everything else is secondary.  I am so happy I stuck with this for the time it took to start to see improvement.e time it took to start to see improvement.</li>
    <li> I have trouble spots on my chin, mostly, and I avoid any regular moisturizer there.  This has been great.  I&#x27;ve been applying it nearly daily (once a day, usually, as I never remember to do more than that) and my chin is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell of grapefruit, which I like.  It is noticeable for the first few minutes, and then it fades away.  It absorbs fairly quickly.  On days I&#x27;m actually wearing makeup, I apply the moisturizer, then do something like brush my hair or my teeth, and then I apply foundation.  It only takes a minute or two to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with the amount I get from the pump, and that has been consistent.</li>
    <li> The grapefruit scent is way to strong and unpleasant and with only .5% salicylic acid it not only doesn&#x27;t help my acne, but the moisturizers have made it worse.  I was hoping for something to replace Neutrogena&#x27;s acne stress control moisturizer that they&#x27;ve discontinued, but this is not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I got a bad windburn/ sunburn in the middle of Feb.  I never use moisturizers because I have oily, acne-prone skin.  I took a chance and got this (along with a spot treatment) to heal the dry skin and help with acne.  Since I already had dry skin/sunburn/windburn, I tried this by itself before adding the other products.  I&#x27;m not sure that this alone actually helped with the acne, but it&#x27;s definitely a great moisturizer that did not make the acne worse.  Now I&#x27;m using it with the Grapefruit wash and Neutrogena&#x27;s spot treatment.  This combo is slowly clearing up an outbreak without irritating my skin.  (Added bonus is that it smells great!) 4 stars for being an excellent moisturizer for acne prone skin/ 1 star removed for not clearing acne without additional products</li>
    <li> The summary:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;I really like the pump design that allows for a quick turn to lock it from dispensing more product without having to press down the dispenser and thus waste product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Right away, the grapefruit scent almost knocked me over.  While I expected some aroma, it was so powerful that I had a hard time using it.  Despite that, I persisted in using it for several days so that I could review it properly.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing to my skin, and it caused acne breakouts during a time in my cycle when I&#x27;m usually clearing up instead of actually assisting with blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and tends toward the dry side, so your mileage may vary.  I just know I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> This pleasant, light scent is so refreshing in the morning.  It absorbs quickly, without leaving a greasy shine.  I was able to apply my foundation easily, over the top of this.  It is a creamy, white consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state that you can apply this 3 times per day, but it warns that it can dry out your skin.  You are going to need to find what works best for you.  I am going to start with 1 time per day, and increase it if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it is working for me.  I love the scent, and I like how quickly it dries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this morning and night for six days and really like it. Besides using it on my face I&#x27;ve used it on the top of my hands. I usually use fragrance free products however I never noticed the grapefruit smell until I read about other reviewers claiming it to be ver strong and then i took note and found that on me the smell is fresh and pleasant and quickly disappears and does not interfere with any fragrance i may wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The .0.5 percent salicylic acid solution goes on easily, does not dry my skin or make it oily and leaves my skin ready for powder and a bit of blush. My skin looks fresher, i think this product has helped my skin shed all those dead skin cells. Also this product has certainly made the backs of my hands look better and feel softer.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not oily. I am not a huge fan of the grapefruit smell though - it just is a little off and stronger than what I would want for a face lotion.</li>
    <li> Moisturized my combination skin without drying. Nice consistency, love the smell! My daughter has used it only on her forehead. Acne is clearing but she is also using other products so can&#x27;t say it helps acne for sure but definitely does not make it worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so sure if it is as acne fighting as it claims to be but I will say that it did help dry out some pimples that I had when I started using it. It probably helped my routine a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend for persons with extremely dry skin or in cold climates. It&#x27;s perfect for my oily skin, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skiny overly moisturized or shiny. If you have really dry skin you may need more moisture than this can offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF protection but otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> Most moisturizers- even the silicon based ones- tend to cause some breakouts for me, and when I put them on at night, by next morning my skin is oily looking and feeling. This one does *not* do that- unless I use too much it goes on dry feeling and stays pretty much that way over night. So, yeah! Despite not being oily, it&#x27;s non-drying, too. It&#x27;s got the right balance for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of salicylic acid is  quite low, but since I&#x27;m not breaking out it must be doing it&#x27;s job. It provides a mild exfoliation that keeps the pores clean. My skin is actually free of pimples- not a single one- for the first time in years. This is a break through for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was a little leery of at first was using a leave on salicylic acid product- I had been using rinse off products. They all had a nasty smell and I didn&#x27;t fancy having that on my face all night. But this product smells of nothing but fresh, juicy, pink grapefruit juice; it smells quite edible so I&#x27;d watch out for it around little kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked a little higher percent of the active ingredient, but other than that, this seems to be a great product for me.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer contains a \\&quot;speck\\&quot; of salicylic acid -- 0.5%. It probably won&#x27;t do anything for you if you suffer more than the very, very occasional breakout. If you have real acne to fight, you can use it as the last step in your regime after you layer on more powerful medications. But don&#x27;t expect any miracles if you use it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, this is a nice, non-greasy lotion. The scent of pink grapefruit is very pleasant. However, it lingers! I could smell it almost all day. Why scent this product with anything at all, since fragrance is one of the top ingredients for causing skin allergies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lifelong acne sufferer, I recommend [[ASIN:B00LK08HR2 Mary Kay Clear Proof Oil-Free Moistruizer for Acne-Prone Skin]] instead.  I use it after cleaning, toning, and treating, only on the drier sections of my face. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, leaves skin soft and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell!</li>
