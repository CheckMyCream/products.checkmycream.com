      <li>My hair is now a beautiful indigo color, which is what I was going for.</li>

      <li>Love that this dye doesnt smell like chemicals!</li>
      <li>I also liked the conditioner that it came with.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>I purchased the midnight muse and it delivered nicely on my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know the strength of the developer this color came with, so I used my own.</li>
      <li>About a month or so ago I spotted this new collection from Vidal Sassoon and it&#x27;s incredible!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the color.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Just a touch of blue is perfect.</li>
      <li>Worked well and the color midnight muse blue is beautiful!</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair silky &amp; smooth!</li>
      <li>My hair looked healthy and shining for a while, but the color faded after a month.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s lovely while it lasts.</li>
      <li>but as of now, I love my color.  </li>
      <li>but you sure aren&#x27;t going to get dramatically blue-hued results.  </li>
      <li>Loved it the first day.</li>
      <li>Easy to mix, easy to apply, and easy to rinse.  </li>
      <li>It does perfect for dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
      <li>I used midnight blue muse and was really happy with the color.</li>
      <li>After 5 days, those 3 hairs are back to their bright silver.  </li>
      <li>I had bright red hair (used henna).</li>
      <li>thing that I found that was really cool</li>
      <li>To add insult to injury, the color washed out alarmingly quickly.  </li>
      <li>And even then my friends tell me there&#x27;s nothing I need to cover, but this makes me feel a little happy</li>
      <li>First, I marked the bottle to show how much developer it had, I dumped it out, then replaced it with my own 40-volume (which removes 4 levels of color).</li>
      <li>Long lasting and great color, lots of compliments!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Colour was very well represented on the box!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be optimistic about getting a strong blue tone.  </li>
      <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t mistreat your hair, it has that going for it.</li>
      <li>I wish it wouldn&#x27;t wash out as fast</li>
      <li>about Midnight Muse Blue, it -is- a deep, rich, shiny black and this formula is one of the more pleasant-smelling home hair dyes available.</li>
      <li>Nice hint of blue in the sun and a nice dark black that I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This will probably remain my go-to shade for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay as a blue-black dye, IF you have naturally dark hair ( I DON&#x27;T)</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t damage the hair like most other brands!!</li>
      <li>looks like a deep, cool black inside, and outside, under the sunlight, shines in beautiful, rich deep and dark blue tones.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With shampooing with shampoo for dyed hair maybe every third day, 4 weeks in and my hair is back to being light brownish.</li>
      <li>Hers did the same, burgundy at first, fading into a purple.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first hair color product I have used in 4 years that has actually taken to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Not bad, but not as &amp;#34;va-va-voom&amp;#34; as other brands.</li>
      <li>The color was more black than blue.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t show expect color on original black hair.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this product, especially to any ladies out there who noticed a change in their hair after pregnancy.</li>
      <li>And don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a few days.  </li>
      <li>Looks great for a few days but then the blue washes out and you&#x27;re left with black hair.</li>
      <li>A friend saw it and went out the next day to buy the exact same color.  </li>
      <li>I use this to retouch my ends after a few months of washing when I think my already-dyed-black ends are dulling or fading from true black-black.  </li>
      <li>This is your standard blue black, but I will say as it fades, you see much more blue (which I like).</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the color is dark with a dark blue sheen.&lt;br /&gt;Something fun without being too &amp;#34;abrupt&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Great if u want to do something fun and work in a conservative workplace</li>
      <li>I used 2 boxes to color my long, straight, dark, healthy Asian hair on Sunday 26 June, and have only washed my hair with color-safe cleansing conditioner twice since then (5 days) and the color is already faded back to my original dark brown/warm black.  </li>
      <li>, that was with my hair outcome at least, any dramatic light change can change it from a vibrant black-blue to looking almost pure black, BUT does not happen in most lighting.</li>
      <li>I tried multiple brands and tried getting it done professionally, but nothing seemed to work.</li>
      <li>It applied evenly across my 3b natural curls and did not strip my hair whatsoever which is very crucial for those with curly hair!</li>
      <li>Now my hair actually has a greenish tone but looks natural otherwise.</li>
      <li>So slight in fact that it only shows up beneath the right lighting.</li>
      <li>There is no grey coverage to speak of.  </li>
      <li>The blue is subtle so it doesn&#x27;t really show, but the black is so black I love it</li>

<li> The blue is subtle so it doesn&#x27;t really show, but the black is so black I love it</li>
<li> I have been dying my hair black since I was in high school (about 15 years) using a variety of brands.  </li>
<li> When I first dyed it, it came out a dark wine color, almost black but with highlights of burgundy.  </li>
<li> If you have long hair you will need 2 boxes to get all of your hair though.</li>
<li> I would try other colors from this line, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use Midnight Muse Blue again.</li>
<li> I did leave it on longer than 30 minutes (about 45) only because I was doing some other stuff.</li>
<li> It did, however, give me some added shine from the included tube of conditioner, which is a generous size, and will last about 2 weeks, assuming you only wash your hair every few days.</li>
<li> I ordered midnight blue, but received black.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not even comparable to the blue black that other brands carry.</li>
<li> In the next few days it will lighten.</li>
<li> This is the bluest black I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used at least 4 different store-bought brands of blue black.&lt;br</li>
<li> Was black inside and in the sun it looked a little blue.</li>
<li> I never had this problem with any other hair color and haven&#x27;t switched shampoos.</li>
<li> should have listened to the other reviews of this product.  </li>
<li> This is just black.</li>
<li> I dye my hair black once a month to go over the roots.</li>
<li> Turns your hair Elvira black.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s almost as if this is a just meant to be a demi-glaze that gives a few days of shine, instead of a permanent hair color.&lt;br</li>
<li> However, after my son was born a few years ago my hair basically refused to hold color.  </li>
<li> is the first I have dyed my hair, I got sick of my dark brown hair, and I thought I would try this.</li>
<li> This feels like false advertising--the color is a cool-toned black.  </li>
<li> I was worried it would have a red base to it, which I did not want.  </li>
<li> I was severely disappointed in the color and annoyed, it didn&#x27;t look like the box at all.</li>
<li> The color payoff is disappointingly non-existent.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
<li> So disappointing!</li>
<li> thoroughly disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Disgusting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not at all blue. thoroughly disappointed. it&#x27;s not even comparable to the blue black that other brands carry. never again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the color. I wish it wouldn&#x27;t wash out as fast but it&#x27;s lovely while it lasts.</li>
    <li> I had bright red hair (used henna). I don&#x27;t know the strength of the developer this color came with, so I used my own. First, I marked the bottle to show how much developer it had, I dumped it out, then replaced it with my own 40-volume (which removes 4 levels of color). Mixed in the color and went for it. My hair is now a beautiful indigo color, which is what I was going for. I did leave it on longer than 30 minutes (about 45) only because I was doing some other stuff. In the next few days it will lighten. But I&#x27;m happy with the results. Great color!</li>
    <li> I had been using the purple and blue Splat dyes over my medium brown hair to give it a tint for about 6 months before I found the Vidal Sasoon Deep Velvet Violet in stores.  I was worried it would have a red base to it, which I did not want.  When I first dyed it, it came out a dark wine color, almost black but with highlights of burgundy.  I was severely disappointed in the color and annoyed, it didn&#x27;t look like the box at all. But after the fading stopped (about 1-2 weeks) my hair looks auburn only indoors.  Outdoors there is a purple to it.  I&#x27;m thinking of doing the blue-black color next but as of now, I love my color.  A friend saw it and went out the next day to buy the exact same color.  Hers did the same, burgundy at first, fading into a purple.  I still think there is too much red in the color but it doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillowcases or hats so for the summertime, I will keep it.</li>
    <li> I used midnight blue muse and was really happy with the color. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. I dye my hair black once a month to go over the roots. I will stick with this color for now!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine product. My hair looked healthy and shining for a while, but the color faded after a month. Now my hair actually has a greenish tone but looks natural otherwise.</li>
    <li> Looks great for a few days but then the blue washes out and you&#x27;re left with black hair.</li>
    <li> Loved it the first day. Was black inside and in the sun it looked a little blue. But it is already fading. Whenever I wash or condition my hair it washes out. I never had this problem with any other hair color and haven&#x27;t switched shampoos. Even with the conditioner that was provided makes it wash out. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really good quality hair dye! It leaves the hair silky &amp; smooth! Doesn&#x27;t damage the hair like most other brands!!</li>
    <li> Love that this dye doesnt smell like chemicals! And it didnt dye my skin! Colour was very well represented on the box!  Home run! #gotitfree as a sample, would definitely buy!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Worked well and the color midnight muse blue is beautiful! If you have long hair you will need 2 boxes to get all of your hair though.</li>
    <li> GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first I have dyed my hair, I got sick of my dark brown hair, and I thought I would try this. It came out JUST LIKE THE COLOR DESCRIBED. It does perfect for dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I found that was really cool, that was with my hair outcome at least, any dramatic light change can change it from a vibrant black-blue to looking almost pure black, BUT does not happen in most lighting. I don&#x27;t mind, thought I would point it out. It could just be me or my hair, but it may happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;The color did come out perfect. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I purchased the midnight muse and it delivered nicely on my hair. Nice hint of blue in the sun and a nice dark black that I was looking for. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last long. With shampooing with shampoo for dyed hair maybe every third day, 4 weeks in and my hair is back to being light brownish. I&#x27;m now looking for another one that might stay longer.</li>
    <li> Zero blue to be found. Turns your hair Elvira black. Bummer.</li>
    <li> This is the bluest black I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used at least 4 different store-bought brands of blue black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a deep, cool black inside, and outside, under the sunlight, shines in beautiful, rich deep and dark blue tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The blue is subtle so it doesn&#x27;t really show, but the black is so black I love it</li>
    <li> While there&#x27;s nothing actually &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; about Midnight Muse Blue, it -is- a deep, rich, shiny black and this formula is one of the more pleasant-smelling home hair dyes available. This will probably remain my go-to shade for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I love this color and it works wonderfully</li>
    <li> Easy to mix, easy to apply, and easy to rinse.  The color looked great on my dark-brown hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. Just a touch of blue is perfect. I&#x27;ve only had it on for 4 days so I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair black since I was in high school (about 15 years) using a variety of brands.  However, after my son was born a few years ago my hair basically refused to hold color.  I tried multiple brands and tried getting it done professionally, but nothing seemed to work. I could never get my hair as &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; as it used to be and the color always faded within two weeks.  About a month or so ago I spotted this new collection from Vidal Sassoon and it&#x27;s incredible!  It&#x27;s the first hair color product I have used in 4 years that has actually taken to my hair.  My hair dyed darker and has lasted longer than it has since before my pregnancy.  I absolutely recommend this product, especially to any ladies out there who noticed a change in their hair after pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Omg, rich beautiful gorgeous color!!! Lovee!!</li>
    <li> Long lasting and great color, lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;However, the color is dark with a dark blue sheen.&lt;br /&gt;Something fun without being too &amp;#34;abrupt&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Great if u want to do something fun and work in a conservative workplace</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only slightly blue. So slight in fact that it only shows up beneath the right lighting. This is just black.</li>
    <li> This color system is awesome! It applied evenly across my 3b natural curls and did not strip my hair whatsoever which is very crucial for those with curly hair! I also liked the conditioner that it came with. Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t do it.  It&#x27;s okay as a blue-black dye, IF you have naturally dark hair ( I DON&#x27;T) but you sure aren&#x27;t going to get dramatically blue-hued results.  I use this to retouch my ends after a few months of washing when I think my already-dyed-black ends are dulling or fading from true black-black.  And even then my friends tell me there&#x27;s nothing I need to cover, but this makes me feel a little happy so there are two stars instead of one. It certainly doesn&#x27;t mistreat your hair, it has that going for it.</li>
    <li> The color was more black than blue. Not bad, but not as &amp;#34;va-va-voom&amp;#34; as other brands. But it doesn&#x27;t bleed and it dyes evenly. I would try other colors from this line, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use Midnight Muse Blue again.</li>
    <li> This feels like false advertising--the color is a cool-toned black.  Apart from that, there is no blue.  To add insult to injury, the color washed out alarmingly quickly.  I used 2 boxes to color my long, straight, dark, healthy Asian hair on Sunday 26 June, and have only washed my hair with color-safe cleansing conditioner twice since then (5 days) and the color is already faded back to my original dark brown/warm black.  There is no grey coverage to speak of.  I have about 3 permanent shiny silver hairs in my bangs that I always try to mask with color so they blend with the rest of my head.  After 5 days, those 3 hairs are back to their bright silver.  It&#x27;s almost as if this is a just meant to be a demi-glaze that gives a few days of shine, instead of a permanent hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to the other reviews of this product.  The color payoff is disappointingly non-existent.  Don&#x27;t be optimistic about getting a strong blue tone.  And don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a few days.  It did, however, give me some added shine from the included tube of conditioner, which is a generous size, and will last about 2 weeks, assuming you only wash your hair every few days.</li>
    <li> So disappointing! Color doesn&#x27;t even reflect any hint of blue. Disgusting.</li>
    <li> This is your standard blue black, but I will say as it fades, you see much more blue (which I like). It also has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t show expect color on original black hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered midnight blue, but received black. This is going back asap.</li>
