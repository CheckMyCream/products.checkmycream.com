### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great makeup remover!!</li>
      <li>Removes great, kinda stings if you get it too close to your eye when cleaning bottom lashes!</li>
      <li>Very good product..</li>
      <li>Seller was great, however the Almay makeup remover not sufficient for eye make up removal.  </li>
      <li>will keep looking for a great remover; one that is not oily, more the feel of a water-based product, but one that can do the job of removing waterproof mascara, and eye liner...</li>
      <li>Expect more from the brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
      <li>These are OK.  </li>
      <li>no tears or burning and gets most of the eye makeup off before using the cleanser.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>THESE WORK  FOR TAKING OFF EYE MAKEUP, VERY GENTLE, AND A GOOD PRICE.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this pads for a long time and for me work perfect.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and travel with and easy on the skin too.</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it really didn&#x27;t have a smell</li>
      <li>Handy to toss into travel makeup bag, but not so great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I have to really scrub under my eyes with these; over and over through many pads.</li>
      <li>No mess,  Nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Not expensive.</li>
      <li>I found this product gentle, but it did not remove my eye-makeup...</li>
      <li>I really dislike them.</li>
      <li>They absolutely will not take off my mascara.</li>
      <li>was fast, thanks.</li>
      <li>Remover itself is gentle and does not hurt eyes or skin.  </li>
      <li>You have to use several at a time which I don&#x27;t care for since that means more rubbing on the sensitive eye area.</li>
      <li>These are definitely &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; as they barely do much for removing eye makeup.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>So I wanted something general like Arbonne.</li>
      <li>These little pads remove all eye makeup quickly and thoroughly, with absolutely no irritation.</li>

<li> I really have not liked these pads.</li>
<li> These seemed a little &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> They did their job, but I had to add a little water to the contain after a few weeks.</li>
<li> it takes me two just to remove makeup from ONE eye (and I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, or do the smokey eye thing...</li>
<li> so, I imagine if you do that it would take at least three pads).  </li>
<li> but I had to use quite a few of the pads for each eye as they are really thin.  </li>
<li> The pads are too small!</li>
<li> However, these are small and tissue paper thin...</li>
<li> The pads are so thin you end up using at least 5 at once to get your makeup off.</li>
<li> Be advised the pads are very small and thin, approximately 1 1/2 inches diameter.  </li>
<li> /&gt;To thin.</li>
<li> They are so thin and flimsy.  </li>
<li> Nothing horrible, just not what I expected from Almay.</li>
<li> I purchased these Almay Makeup Remover pads but slightly disappointed.</li>

<ol>
    <li> great makeup remover!!</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of these.  They are so thin and flimsy.  I&#x27;d have to use about 30 of them to get my eye makeup off.  Now I just use them for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Seller was great, however the Almay makeup remover not sufficient for eye make up removal.  I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> These are definitely &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; as they barely do much for removing eye makeup. You have to use several at a time which I don&#x27;t care for since that means more rubbing on the sensitive eye area.</li>
    <li> The pads are too small!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted a makeup remover for eyeliner and mascara. I liked the fact that it really didn&#x27;t have a smell but I had to use quite a few of the pads for each eye as they are really thin.  I will not purchase this product again I will try something else.</li>
    <li> Removes great, kinda stings if you get it too close to your eye when cleaning bottom lashes!</li>
    <li> I really have not liked these pads. They absolutely will not take off my mascara. I just use regular Loreall mascara!&lt;br /&gt;I used to have an Arbonne face cleanser that removed all my makeup. It was discontinued. So I wanted something general like Arbonne. I have to really scrub under my eyes with these; over and over through many pads. I never get it all off. I go to bed like a raccoon and have probably damaged the skin under my eyes. I really dislike them. Buying something else!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes.  These little pads remove all eye makeup quickly and thoroughly, with absolutely no irritation.</li>
    <li> I purchased these Almay Makeup Remover pads but slightly disappointed. The pads are so thin you end up using at least 5 at once to get your makeup off. It is not oily and I didn&#x27;t have any unwanted reactions or burning in my eyes. I just wish the pads were thicker because my bottle was gone in about week.</li>
    <li> These seemed a little &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  I like that they are oil-free, though.  They did their job, but I had to add a little water to the contain after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and travel with and easy on the skin too. No mess,  Nice fragrance. Not expensive. Stay moist.</li>
    <li> Expect more from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;To thin.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for probably 10+ years. My preferred eye makeup remover product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this pads for a long time and for me work perfect.</li>
    <li> THESE WORK  FOR TAKING OFF EYE MAKEUP, VERY GENTLE, AND A GOOD PRICE.</li>
    <li> I like this product!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, thanks.</li>
    <li> I found this product gentle, but it did not remove my eye-makeup...(Maybe I need the non-gentle version)&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking for a great remover; one that is not oily, more the feel of a water-based product, but one that can do the job of removing waterproof mascara, and eye liner...</li>
    <li> Remover itself is gentle and does not hurt eyes or skin.  Be advised the pads are very small and thin, approximately 1 1/2 inches diameter.  Handy to toss into travel makeup bag, but not so great for everyday use.</li>

    <li> Very good product..no tears or burning and gets most of the eye makeup off before using the cleanser.</li>
    <li> These are OK.  My eyes don&#x27;t burn, and it does remove makeup...However, these are small and tissue paper thin... it takes me two just to remove makeup from ONE eye (and I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, or do the smokey eye thing...so, I imagine if you do that it would take at least three pads).  Nothing horrible, just not what I expected from Almay.</li>
