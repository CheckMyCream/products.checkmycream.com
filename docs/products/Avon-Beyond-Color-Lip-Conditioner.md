### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent for my lips.</li>
      <li>Avon seems to have discontinued this product so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The best lip conditioner on the market is Maybelline Baby Lips; in my opinion.</li>
      <li>BEST PLUMPER EVER!</li>
      <li>This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It was in very good condition.</li>
      <li>Very good lip conditioner.</li>
      <li>I use this with Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Lip Treatment and the combination works great.</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer, that&#x27;s where it begins and ends.</li>
      <li>but girls, IF YOU WANT THAT PERFECT LIGHT TONED COLOR, THIS IS THE LIP GLOSS FOR YOU!</li>
      <li>Results are good and as others have said.  </li>
      <li>It is a great lip plumper as well as a nice primer.</li>
      <li>Bought this on a \\&quot;why not try it\\&quot; whim and am glad I did!</li>
      <li>nothing redeeming about this &#x27;product&#x27;!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This lipstick feels absolutely amazing on my lips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this lipstick before and liked it.</li>
      <li>i even kept the tube in case i ever try to make my own lip product.</li>
      <li>It may not be a miracle plumper, but it does have a nice tingly feeling and it seems to moisturize well.</li>
      <li>does the job nicely for that.</li>
      <li>This is a nice lip balm.</li>
      <li>A good retinol-infused product will leave lips more moisturized and healthy the longer you wear it.  </li>
      <li>the quality of this is good and because of the price and the fact that it has a nice tint and goes on so smooth</li>
      <li>The best for soft and protected lips!</li>
      <li>Great lip conditioner and good plumping action.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say this is pretty good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure on whether any plumping lipstick works, and I bought this for this conditioning aspect-</li>
      <li>Makes my lips feel great and really does fill or plump the lip lines.</li>
      <li>The top of the lip stick did not broke off after two weeks.  </li>
      <li>Favorite lip plumper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years &amp; just love it.</li>
      <li>I liked this because it really feels good on my lips.</li>
      <li>I am about to order more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a lipstick than a gloss...</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love the feel of conditioner just for lips.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping to save some precious dollars by buying Avon.  </li>
      <li>As for moisturizing, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>not any better than chap</li>
      <li>In the 80s, my favorite lip product was Blistex with SPF.  </li>
      <li>only plus to this product is the very attractive and sturdy packaging.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much and was glad to find such good service and to have the product arrive in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carollane</li>
      <li>I have pretty good lips anyway, but don&#x27;t see that this does anything more than a 99 cent tube of chapstick.  </li>
      <li>Nice Sheene colar and not bad of taste.</li>
      <li>Was excited to be able to purchase this from Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over two years now with great success and am very grateful</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special</li>
      <li>The price is certainly great - most plain  lipsticks cost more than that!</li>
      <li>Their Anew products are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice as a lipstick, but I really can&#x27;t see any plumping effect.</li>
      <li>It had such great reviews.  </li>
      <li>,Avon was a good price and this goes on easy ,not dry and waxy</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was free and quick.</li>
      <li>I only loved this product because it gave me the lighter color looking lips</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for mostly a moisturizing lip product, this is adequate but don&#x27;t expect to get much in the way of plumping.</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars, however,  because it&#x27;s my new favorite lip gloss</li>
      <li>Works well not only on my lips &amp; around my mouth but also on the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; from my nose to my mouth, on my chin, my \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; around my eyes, fine lines on my forehead &amp; between my brows as well as any fine lines on my neck toward my chest from sun-exposure...&lt;br /&gt;Mind</li>
      <li>IT IS SO WORTH</li>
      <li>A poor product at best....</li>
      <li>I order these regularly, use daily and have loved it for years!</li>
      <li>Just another good lip moisturizer, doe not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
      <li>Nice creamy lipstick, but completely ineffectual as far as plumping the lips.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much but moisturize and the darn thing melted after leaving it in our bathroom, and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot Summer day!</li>
      <li>Its also has a nice subtle color that you may be able to wear out.</li>
      <li>my bottom like did get bigger but top lip</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Sally&#x27;s Extreme plumper and it works better for me!</li>
      <li>Lip stick broke off first use.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it since I don&#x27;t like using lipstick on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>and the combination is nice - other customers might not want or need as much plumping help as I do, and would like to get both.  </li>
      <li>This product keeps my lips soft &amp; full. . .</li>
      <li>The LipFusion XL (ranked 3rd in that particular survey) has always been my favorite, but it costs close to $40 on Amazon and this one costs $7.50.  </li>
      <li>I would originally use cover up or concealer (what most girls do to get the pale color) on my lips</li>
      <li>some more so if you suffer with dry peeling lips this may be the solution for you too...</li>
      <li>It certainly does plump and condition.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my water bottle or cups as much as Chapstick.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;a very timely fashion.</li>
      <li>However, I will say this one seems to be as much a primer as a plumper</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t lick my lips so much with this............</li>
      <li>Just buy a cheap lip gloss or chapstick, it will work the same.</li>
      <li>Ready to use.</li>
      <li>tried product 3 weeks straight applied product throughout the day ..</li>
      <li>I like it, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>So now I have a lip conditioner at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product does much of anything.  </li>
      <li>This product does nothing but put a thin, white, waxy coat on the lips, one that acts (at best) as a primer.  </li>
      <li>However, I am quite pleased with this product and will stick with it as with regular use, my lips stay soft and don&#x27;t flake.  </li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to spend time comparing lipsticks for special conditioners or pay for extra long-lasting ones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky at all, goes on so smooth, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly because of chapped and aging lips.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your lips a little lighter colored, so if you need color in your lips, you will need to layer on your favorite shade.</li>
      <li>i use a lot of plumping products and this has been the least effective of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The secret seems to be a good conditioner followed by powder and then lipstick application.  </li>
      <li>The doctor told me that certain products were made or more concentrated from petroleum and that was a fairly common reaction.  </li>
      <li>Lessons learned: If you live in AZ, don&#x27;t order anything meltable online.</li>
      <li>I put it on at night before I go to bed &amp; wake up in the morning with very very soft lips.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s clear!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as the LipFusion plumper, so will go back to the more expensive one next time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite lip conditioner.  I started using it one time instead of Chapstick when my lips were flaking and on the verge of cracking during a cold, cold winter and when I was sick and sleeping a lot.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a slick feeling surface on your lips like Chapstick and doesn&#x27;t have an aftertaste when you lick your lips or long after application when you are eating or drinking.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my water bottle or cups as much as Chapstick.  In the 80s, my favorite lip product was Blistex with SPF.  Then one day after years of use, my lips swelled up big, turned red, started burning and got bumps.  I actually had to go to the doctor the next day for a hydrocortisone topic prescription and it still took weeks for the bumps to go away.  The doctor told me that certain products were made or more concentrated from petroleum and that was a fairly common reaction.  So since that time, I&#x27;ve had to be very careful trying lip conditioners and lipsticks.  I miss the &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34; tingle of the Blistex, and often the extra SPF protection that isn&#x27;t found in every lip product.  However, I am quite pleased with this product and will stick with it as with regular use, my lips stay soft and don&#x27;t flake.  It is a good base for lipstick as well.  I just outline my lips after applying this, pat a little loose powder on them and then apply the lipstick and almost any lipstick color stays on longer with that method.  Now I don&#x27;t have to spend time comparing lipsticks for special conditioners or pay for extra long-lasting ones.  The secret seems to be a good conditioner followed by powder and then lipstick application.  So now I have a lip conditioner at a reasonable price and I save money by not having to buy expensive lipstick with all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever used.  It does not feel waxy like chapstick, and isn&#x27;t sticky like lip smackers or other lip glosses.  As far as the plumping aspect goes, it seems to plump a little.  But importantly, it does not feel like the typical lip plumping products, in that it doesn&#x27;t make your lips swell up in that weird, scary, holy-crap-am-I-anaphalaxing?! sort of way.</li>
    <li> Favorite lip plumper.</li>
    <li> Been using for years - I was an Avon rep in the 1980s and I never stopped using this lip conditioner.  My lips are still soft and plump considering I am in my late 60s and I do use lipstick that remains on your lips all day.  My lips are still soft and not dry.</li>
    <li> Lip stick broke off first use.  Don&#x27;t know if the product or the way it was shipped in plastic wrapper through the US Mail.  Also, did not see any difference from this lip conditioner than from just using petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> This lip plumper didn&#x27;t work for me so well. I&#x27;ve tried the Sally&#x27;s Extreme plumper and it works better for me! You can find it at walmart for $7. I only loved this product because it gave me the lighter color looking lips I&#x27;ve always wanted. My lip color is an ugly red and I&#x27;ve always wanted the paler colored lips! I would originally use cover up or concealer (what most girls do to get the pale color) on my lips but girls, IF YOU WANT THAT PERFECT LIGHT TONED COLOR, THIS IS THE LIP GLOSS FOR YOU!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much but moisturize and the darn thing melted after leaving it in our bathroom, and it wasn&#x27;t even a hot Summer day!</li>
    <li> This goes on so smoothly&amp; long lasting. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years &amp; just love it. Was excited to be able to purchase this from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Great lip conditioner and good plumping action. I use this with Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Lip Treatment and the combination works great.</li>
    <li> I like it, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> But, it was discontinued by Avon.  I have been trying to find something to replace it ever since with no luck.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of conditioner just for lips.  Soothes chapped lips and keeps them soft during cold winter months.  Use every day</li>
    <li> Just buy a cheap lip gloss or chapstick, it will work the same. And the colour was about the same as the old style white lip zinc.&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Very good lip conditioner. I have used it for years, and I try not to run out of it.</li>
    <li> I liked this because it really feels good on my lips. It lasts for  hrs . I don&#x27;t lick my lips so much with this............&lt;br /&gt;Jewell</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer, that&#x27;s where it begins and ends. There is absolutely no visible lip plumping effect. Just another good lip moisturizer, doe not worth the money I paid for it. Would not buy this product again..</li>
    <li> I bought this assuming actual plumbing properties. No...it&#x27;s just over priced chapstick.</li>
    <li> This lip conditioner makes my lips so soft. I put it on at night before I go to bed &amp; wake up in the morning with very very soft lips. I like Avon products.Its also has a nice subtle color that you may be able to wear out.</li>
    <li> Results are good and as others have said.  The top of the lip stick did not broke off after two weeks.  You need to put this lipstick down ALL the way after each use, I left it up a little bit, like I usually do with other lipsticks .  In this one there is a protruding piece in the cap that will jab the stick and pull/break it off if you don&#x27;t put it down all the way or if you apply it to hard and shift the stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up just using a lip brush.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips feel great and really does fill or plump the lip lines. Makes my thin lower lip plumper and fuller looking. The effect is temporary, of course, but there is a generous amount of lipstick in this item. And at this low price, I&#x27;ll never run out.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was free and quick.</li>
    <li> Lessons learned: If you live in AZ, don&#x27;t order anything meltable online. Okay, so it&#x27;s a little misshapen due to the heat but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. This product provided minimal plumping, barely noticeable, like only 10% if that. As for moisturizing, it&#x27;s okay. So if you&#x27;re looking for mostly a moisturizing lip product, this is adequate but don&#x27;t expect to get much in the way of plumping.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product does much of anything.  I have pretty good lips anyway, but don&#x27;t see that this does anything more than a 99 cent tube of chapstick.  Maybe if I had totally thin lips, I&#x27;d see a difference.</li>
    <li> dont waste your time/money this product does nothing to my lips as far as plumping. I will use it up only for the moisturizing effects. I find chap stick to work as well for that!!</li>
    <li> Ok. Light moisturizer. I would not buy it again. You can get the same amount of moisture from lotion or moisterizerss</li>
    <li> not any better than chap stick  and lip balm you buy at the grocery store, Doesn&#x27;t plump lips as advertised. Do not waste your money for it.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say this is pretty good however I prefer Peter Thomas Roth lip balm over this ,Avon was a good price and this goes on easy ,not dry and waxy it has a slight tint to it so you could wear alone or if you prefer with lipstick over it.If your looking for lip plumping I would say no this wont do that this is just a lip conditioner like any lip balm the quality of this is good and because of the price and the fact that it has a nice tint and goes on so smooth I would order this again.</li>
    <li> the worst lip plumper EVER! EVER! the plumping effect - 0, the moisturizing  effect - 0. I think grease from fried chicken would done better job then this thing! what&#x27;s in it?</li>
    <li> This does not plump lips at all?  Its rather sticky on my lips when put on... like wax, would not recommend</li>
    <li> I order these regularly, use daily and have loved it for years! The best for soft and protected lips!</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly because of chapped and aging lips.  I&#x27;ve tried myriad other products and nothing... I mean nothing ever worked for me.  So with trepidation I decided to try once again.  I purchased the exfoliator from Avon as well as the lip conditioner and I must say I am amazed that they actually WORK!  No more chapped peeling lips - Hooray!  Plumping... well yes I would say there is some but nothing drastic - maybe a few less deep lines but maybe that&#x27;s just wishful thinking as well?  I just came back to buy some more so if you suffer with dry peeling lips this may be the solution for you too... I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> A poor product at best....&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;worthless for the reason that it&lt;br /&gt;was intended...supposely....to moisturize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No...nothing redeeming about this &#x27;product&#x27;!</li>
    <li> As the title states, I have noticed absolutely no plumping whatsoever from this product. I gave it four stars, however,  because it&#x27;s my new favorite lip gloss /moisturizer. It&#x27;s not sticky at all, goes on so smooth, and lasts a long time. I will buy this again,  but not for its plumping properties.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would!!! I have never been a fan of Avon (call me a makeup snob) but I will definitely purchase this again. It is a great lip plumper as well as a nice primer.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lip balm. The moisture lasts for a bit, but if you are looking for something to plump your lips, move along. This has a matte finish, not sticky or tacky. It leaves your lips a little lighter colored, so if you need color in your lips, you will need to layer on your favorite shade. I don&#x27;t hate the product, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It certainly does plump and condition. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much of the plumping but than everyone&#x27;s different. Nice Sheene colar and not bad of taste. Helps moisturize lips throughout the the day. Need to apply frequently.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t get the hype about this product. i use a lot of plumping products and this has been the least effective of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also exfoliate my lips everyday and they are very smooth and moisturized, but if i put this on in then later go to reapply it balls up on my lips and makes them feel disgusting and look extremely chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this did not moisturize my lips at all and the amount of product you get is pathetic for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the formula is very soft and broke off at the base after just a few applications making the tube really messy every time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only plus to this product is the very attractive and sturdy packaging. i even kept the tube in case i ever try to make my own lip product.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my lips.Never again I have my lips dry.</li>
    <li> I have used it all up align with fusion beauty lip fusion as recommended but no difference in lips. None.</li>
    <li> I like it but its not my fave.  wasn&#x27;t too expensive though, so I guess it was worth it.  doesn&#x27;t seem to plump my lips at all</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! BEST PLUMPER EVER! IT REALLY WORKS! DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THIS WAS RATED NUMBER ONE ON THE MARKET! NOW I KNOW WHY! DO THE RESEARCH... IT IS SO WORTH IT AND THE COST IS LOW!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a \\&quot;why not try it\\&quot; whim and am glad I did! Works well not only on my lips &amp; around my mouth but also on the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; from my nose to my mouth, on my chin, my \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; around my eyes, fine lines on my forehead &amp; between my brows as well as any fine lines on my neck toward my chest from sun-exposure...&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I don&#x27;t just put it on and let it rest - I Rub it IN everywhere I apply it and use my small electric wrist-massager to further work it in and smooth out the fine \\&quot;ridge-lines\\&quot; that&#x27;ll form on either side of facial creasing from daily smiling and squinting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over two years now with great success and am very grateful to&#x27;ve found it again here on Amazon as it disappeared from the Avon-consultant route and I resorted to using the \\&quot;beige\\&quot; color to plump and soften my look nightly before I found it here in the \\&quot;Beyond Color\\&quot; clear-shade - WHEW !!!&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope it works for others as it&#x27;s worked for me, and again - rather than merely applying it I DO rub it in be it on my mouth &amp; face at bedtime followed by my moisturizers or for simple daily lip-care</li>
    <li> I have a problem with chapped lips from December to March every single year. Started using this in October, it&#x27;s the end of January, and I don&#x27;t have even a bit of chapped lips. I use it every morning under my regular lip tint. If you&#x27;re looking for actual plumping, look elsewhere- it doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I&#x27;m not so sure on whether any plumping lipstick works, and I bought this for this conditioning aspect- does the job nicely for that.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of complaints from other reviewers stating that this product doesn&#x27;t plump. This is because it plumps your lips through the ingredient, retinol, which takes time to take effect. This is not the instant lip plumping stuff; if you are looking for immediate results, I suggest DuWop&#x27;s Lip Venom Gloss, which burns and tingles to plump up your lips. However, that is a temporary effect that goes away after a few hours, while Avon&#x27;s plumper is more of a permanent fix, when used regularly over time (not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t cause pain). My lips are smoother and feel healthier than they ever have before. This lipstick feels absolutely amazing on my lips. Also, the 15 SPF is definitely a plus. I actually did some research on lip plumpers and Avon came out as the #1 lip plumping product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works because I haven&#x27;t used it everyday, but I do like it as a lip moisturizer....feels good especially if you have chapped sore lips!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice as a lipstick, but I really can&#x27;t see any plumping effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lipstick before and liked it. It may not be a miracle plumper, but it does have a nice tingly feeling and it seems to moisturize well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I absolutely love it since I don&#x27;t like using lipstick on a daily basis. It moisturizes your lips while giving it a hint of shine.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Have tried others, but they just don&#x27;t compare.  This product keeps my lips soft &amp; full. . . no need for chap stick at this time of year!!</li>
    <li> tried product 3 weeks straight applied product throughout the day .. my bottom like did get bigger but top lip minimal. not worth it ..</li>
    <li> I bought this lip conditioner because of the rave reviews.  It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special and I won&#x27;t purchase again. The best lip conditioner on the market is Maybelline Baby Lips; in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice creamy lipstick, but completely ineffectual as far as plumping the lips.  Also, I think you have to use a sunblock when using a retinol product and for at least several days after stopping use, so you should be careful.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to save some precious dollars by buying Avon.  Their Anew products are fabulous.  But they definitely need to go back to the lab on this one.  This product does nothing but put a thin, white, waxy coat on the lips, one that acts (at best) as a primer.  A good retinol-infused product will leave lips more moisturized and healthy the longer you wear it.  Avon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Conditioner&amp;#34;?  No way.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed in this product.  It had such great reviews.  It&#x27;s more of a lipstick than a gloss...I know it doesn&#x27;t say gloss but it&#x27;s clear!  It&#x27;s a little waxy for my liking.</li>
    <li> Avon seems to have discontinued this product so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It arrived in&lt;br /&gt;a very timely fashion. It was in very good condition. Ready to use. I am about to order more. I like this product very much and was glad to find such good service and to have the product arrive in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carollane</li>
    <li> I found something on line that rated this plumper as a top choice, with others I had used before ranked 2nd and 3rd behind it.  The LipFusion XL (ranked 3rd in that particular survey) has always been my favorite, but it costs close to $40 on Amazon and this one costs $7.50.  So, of course, I wanted to try it.  It&#x27;s not as effective as the LipFusion plumper, so will go back to the more expensive one next time.  However, I will say this one seems to be as much a primer as a plumper and the combination is nice - other customers might not want or need as much plumping help as I do, and would like to get both.  The price is certainly great - most plain  lipsticks cost more than that!</li>
