      <li>Good:</li>
      <li>Good product and good service.</li>
      <li>These are amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>Loved it, easy to use and very light.  </li>
      <li>Works great and it was certainly what I had in mind.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair cutter .</li>
      <li>My friend/hairdresser was amazed and highly pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>I will be doing my husband&#x27;s hair also:)</li>
      <li>Just love them.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s proportionate to the length of my hair which I couldn&#x27;t make it do for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I replaced the blades and they work better.</li>
      <li>works well, these combs are very easy to use and the blades can be easily maintained</li>
      <li>Works pretty good once you figure out how to maneuver it.</li>
      <li>for- thinning out my daughter&#x27;s very full hair.</li>
      <li>(price was excellent) wanting to use the other one for my dog.</li>
      <li>it is easy for me to  cut/trim my son hair without messup as before I used scissor</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving them so far. !:)</li>
      <li>Bought these for thinning hair on our horses this spring before the &amp;#34;big shed&amp;#34; We like these because some horses don&#x27;t like the sound of the clippers around their face.</li>
      <li>: Plastic that protects scalp is cheap.</li>
      <li>Like my old Popeil  trim comb better but can&#x27;t buy them any more.</li>
      <li>I used bit more force to run through and maybe that&#x27;s why so much hair thinned out so quickly.</li>
      <li>work exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to, easy to handle and operate</li>
      <li>I got home and used it which was pretty straight forward, I was more than happy as my hair tends to grow out poofy rather than growing long.</li>
      <li>And he might turn hairless quickly.</li>
      <li>I love it and would highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
      <li>Luckily I bought two and was able to complete the haircut.</li>
      <li>Just to be on the safe side, I pinned up some hair and ran the comb through only on the back of the head and boy am I glad I did that.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>BUT I HAVE THE IMPRESSION I WILL HAVE TO BUY MORE BLADES LATER.</li>
      <li>This does a great job of thinning out the bottom of my hair as I have pretty thick hair.</li>
      <li>If you want to trim or cut a lot off, angle it more flat towards your head.</li>
      <li>fantastic job!I was able to cut my whole head of  super thick hair.</li>
      <li>The handle on this one makes it much easier to use.  </li>
      <li>It cuts very evenly this way.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and you pretty much can&#x27;t really mess up even if you&#x27;re a rookie.</li>
      <li>you actually use it, it very much depends on the angle you&#x27;re using it.</li>
      <li>OMG this thing will pull your hair and take it all off, ven if you barely touch your hair to use it is pulling or shredding way to much hair off</li>
      <li>Not sure how they will stand up long term in the barn, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>The item is unsafe and should be returned completely!</li>
      <li>Next time (though I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t need to thin out daughter&#x27;s hair for quite a while), I&#x27;ll try to comb very very gently.</li>
      <li>I used the long side of the trimmer and it doesn&#x27;t cut as much as you think which is great, because you can&#x27;t uncut</li>
      <li>and I like that I can use standard straight razor blades for replacements.</li>
      <li>Super sharp!</li>
      <li>The blade is very sharp and cuts quickly without any pull.  </li>
      <li>If you want to be more careful and cut less, angle it away from your head.</li>
      <li>It will remove a lot of hair without much effort so be careful.</li>
      <li>It shreds hair...and left me with major split ends.</li>

<li> Awful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I always wanted a hair trimmer but I was nervous about how my hair would turn out. Then I saw this bad boy and I said to myself, &amp;#34;A hair trimmer AND a comb? Couldn&#x27;t get any easier than that. Sign me up!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home and used it which was pretty straight forward, I was more than happy as my hair tends to grow out poofy rather than growing long. Now it&#x27;s proportionate to the length of my hair which I couldn&#x27;t make it do for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you actually use it, it very much depends on the angle you&#x27;re using it. If you want to trim or cut a lot off, angle it more flat towards your head. If you want to be more careful and cut less, angle it away from your head. I used the long side of the trimmer and it doesn&#x27;t cut as much as you think which is great, because you can&#x27;t uncut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I cannot recommend enough for people with thick poofy hair.</li>
    <li> It did what I bought it for- thinning out my daughter&#x27;s very full hair. Par other&#x27;s review, I washed and dried her hair before using this comb. Just to be on the safe side, I pinned up some hair and ran the comb through only on the back of the head and boy am I glad I did that. Bunch of hair dropped to the floor in seconds. It did pull so I used bit more force to run through and maybe that&#x27;s why so much hair thinned out so quickly. Next time (though I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t need to thin out daughter&#x27;s hair for quite a while), I&#x27;ll try to comb very very gently. The comb was not flimsy. Wish it didn&#x27;t pull. I bought two (price was excellent) wanting to use the other one for my dog. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll tolerate the pull. And he might turn hairless quickly. I&#x27;ll update my review if I try on him. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase bc it did what I hoped it&#x27;d do and price was excellent (2 for $6).</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job</li>
    <li> Good: Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Plastic that protects scalp is cheap. One of the notches broke exposing the razor after one use. Luckily I bought two and was able to complete the haircut. I wrote to the seller to explain the issue and they wanted pictures of the item and then wouldn&#x27;t pay for the return ahipping cost. Why pictures? The item is unsafe and should be returned completely! I printed out the return shupping label at the top just to see that I still had to pay the return postage even though I wanted to just exchange the bad razor out for a new one. It&#x27;s one thing to return an item because you don&#x27;t like it (in that situation it makes sense for the buyer to cover the cost of the item). However, after one use the item became dangerous/defective to use.</li>
    <li> work exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to, easy to handle and operate</li>
    <li> I love this hair cutter . it is easy for me to  cut/trim my son hair without messup as before I used scissor</li>
    <li> thrown in the garbage</li>
    <li> Bought these for thinning hair on our horses this spring before the &amp;#34;big shed&amp;#34; We like these because some horses don&#x27;t like the sound of the clippers around their face.

    <li> Loved it, easy to use and very light.  I will not have to go to the beauty shop anymore.  I will be doing my husband&#x27;s hair also:)</li>
    <li> Good product and good service.</li>
    <li> works well, these combs are very easy to use and the blades can be easily maintained</li>
    <li> Works great and it was certainly what I had in mind.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of thinning out the bottom of my hair as I have pretty thick hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and you pretty much can&#x27;t really mess up even if you&#x27;re a rookie.</li>
    <li> I purchase to cut my dogs hair with. So-so. It works but not as good as those kickin scissors I got from a amazon add-on!</li>
    <li> I had recently cut off all 26inches of my hair into a Pixie and then as it started to grow I realized I had to figure out a way to maintain it and I found these. Just love them. Will recommend to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT BUT I HAVE THE IMPRESSION I WILL HAVE TO BUY MORE BLADES LATER. I WASN&#x27;T COUNTING ON THAT.</li>
    <li> Awful! It shreds hair...and left me with major split ends.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. We purchased two of them. My daughter wanted one to maintain her short haircut so she wouldn&#x27;t have to have it trimmed so often, I wanted one for trimming our dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on hair. Our dogs fur is a bit thick for it, but it did work on the dogs face,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the coolest features of these is that the blades are replaceable, and you can purchase replacement blades locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem we had with them is that my daughter threw hers in a bathroom drawer and thinking it was a regular comb, my husband used it on his hair not knowing that he was cutting it.</li>
    <li> Super sharp! fantastic job!I was able to cut my whole head of  super thick hair.</li>
    <li> The blades are weak and do not cut well. I replaced the blades and they work better.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good once you figure out how to maneuver it. Like my old Popeil  trim comb better but can&#x27;t buy them any more. Nice it uses standard double edge blades.</li>
    <li> These work great I&#x27;m loving them so far. !:)</li>
    <li> OMG this thing will pull your hair and take it all off, ven if you barely touch your hair to use it is pulling or shredding way to much hair off</li>

    <li> My friend/hairdresser was amazed and highly pleased with this product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use it for my 3 boys.  It helps me save some money in between haircuts.</li>
    <li> I have thick &amp; used-to-be long hair.  Got carried away on this.  Then had to hire a stylist to even out.  So it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> works great, I use it on my yorkie &amp; I love it!!!</li>
