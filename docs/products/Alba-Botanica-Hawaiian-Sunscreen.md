### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>AND smells delicious too.</li>
      <li>This Alba Botanica spray is an excellent sunscreen item.</li>
      <li>In terms of convenience the spray feature is excellent to cover exposed skin in an expeditious manner.  </li>
      <li>I was impressed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Alba Botanica has some beautifully engineered products.  </li>
      <li>Great convenience and smell but</li>
      <li>Like being in the Carribean, works great</li>
      <li>Great spray</li>
      <li>The smell is great.</li>
      <li>Great list as there are some brands I have never heard of.</li>
      <li>The SPF is perfect for me because I burn very easily.  </li>
      <li>This is a good option smell notwithstanding.</li>
      <li>Definitely the best can of spray sunscreen ever, and best of all we didn’t burn.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen has a nice, understated coconut smell that makes it pleasant when you put it on but fades into the background so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>My daughters and I love Alba lip products, they always smell great.</li>
      <li>LOVE that this is AIR POWERED &amp; AEROSOL FREE!!!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this sunscreen too: it smells how sunscreen should smell, like your at the beach!</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, it smells great, and it is in a spray form which makes it easy to go on.</li>
      <li>Kind of reminded me of the products we used in the 80&#x27;s -- all tropical, all the time.</li>
      <li>With this spray I had to kind of &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Perhaps, someday, Alba Botanica could be spun off into its own company or purchased by someone else.</li>
      <li>I liked this sunscreen product for a number of reasons: to begin with, it isn&#x27;t an oil or a cream.  </li>
      <li>Alba Botanica does not seem to be its own company, just a brand of Hain Celestial.  </li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and burn easily.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is that of light coconut and is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Just a light pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Very easy to apply, just sprays on&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: the scent is not as pleasant as the oil, and while it is easy to use - it&#x27;s too much money for a sunscreen for me unless it smelled a bit more pleasant.</li>
      <li>and I ok with it having inhalants etc.</li>
      <li>I thought I would love, love, love this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I believe as a spray-on sunscreen, the product would work well for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It carries that warning that the spray is flammable--so smokers beware when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to evaluate, but I would buy this product on my own once the sample is gone.</li>
      <li>I love Alba Bontanica coconut oil, so</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Seems more ecologically minded than most products of its kind</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, it just has an odor that is no to my liking</li>
      <li>/&gt;BACKGROUND:  Most everyone in my family got to try this item out, either around our pool or at the beach.  </li>
      <li>Also, the cap has a twist closure so it will not accidentally spray during travel - my favorite item about</li>
      <li>I was impressed that it did not leave a smell after the initial spray settled on our body.</li>
      <li>Also, the aerosol is &amp;#34;air powered&amp;#34; so it is environmentally safe.  </li>
      <li>They have many SPF sunscreen products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love spray on sun screens, as a rule:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this!&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, this sunscreen has a nice, light scent that is not cloying.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>and feel confident it is fairly safe</li>
      <li>It has a nice light coconut smell.  </li>
      <li>and I love the coconut</li>
      <li>I am pleased.  </li>
      <li>This smells really good and applies super easily without leaving you choking on a noxious cloud.</li>
      <li>It is SPF 50 which is pretty good protection.  </li>
      <li>super nice... works well</li>
      <li>The packaging is nice, the spray volume more than adequate, and the product goes on easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde with very fair freckled skin, living in the South, so I get a lot of sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and has a nice light coconut scent.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and does not feel at all oily.  </li>
      <li>Sprays easily, doesn&#x27;t get clogged up, even after being in a beach bag and in the sand</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, one of the major aspects that I found attractive of Alba Botanica was the fact they have 100% Vegetarian Ingredients and not tested on animals.  </li>
      <li>I found the smell fine and the bottle easy to hold (in spite of damp hands from humidity and heat).</li>
      <li>Alba Botanica has several beautifully engineered products.  </li>
      <li>and I just rubbed it in and was fine.</li>
      <li>Nice smell (only mildly coconutty) and good coverage.</li>
      <li>#34;gluten-free.&amp;#34;  Most people do NOT have gluten sensitivities, and certainly, I don&#x27;t imagine there are many people in this world that have a contact sensitivity to gluten on their skin.  </li>
      <li>It has an aerosol free sprayer.</li>
      <li>This is just as light as the Hawaiian Tropic SPF 8.  </li>
      <li>This is light sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>so I am sure that is why there is no artificially manufactured &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; smell infused within it.  </li>
      <li>The sunscreen went on smooth, isn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it to the limits of its SPF rating, but, so far, so good.</li>
      <li>I used a different non-spray kind for my face and this kind for our bodies.</li>
      <li>It emits a very fine spray that coats the skin evenly on the first pass.</li>
      <li>This is an easy to use product that dispenses a good amount of liquid that I use on my face and arms prior to going into the sun.  </li>
      <li>We received a can of &amp;#34;Alba Botanica Hawaiian, Coconut Spray Sunscreen SPF 50, 6 Ounce&amp;#34; via the Vine program to evaluate, and we were initially excited to extend our experience with Alba Botanica&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Unless you have open sores, and I don&#x27;t think you should be spraying a chemical like sunscreen on those sores anyway.to be absorbed systemically in great quantities.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seemed effective when I tested it on our first hot summer day two days ago; nobody got any sunburn on our trip to the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is fast drying, but it suggests that you put it on 15 minutes before going into the water to make sure it is fully dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is probably true for the Alba Botanica labeled products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>QUICK SUMMARY:  </li>
      <li>”&lt;br /&gt;There aren’t too many individuals on the planet who know more about celiac disease than Dr. Fasano, so please, do not let anyone, including medical professionals convince you that gluten protein can be absorbed through the skin and cause a celiac disease reaction.</li>
      <li>”&lt;br /&gt;There aren’t too many individuals on the planet who know more about celiac disease than Dr. Fasano, so please, do not let anyone, including medical professionals convince you that gluten protein can be absorbed through the skin and cause a celiac disease reaction.</li>
      <li>It applied SUPER easy and very even.</li>
      <li>The scent of the spray is subtly coconut that is very pleasant, but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to work well - no sunburn or even much tan which is fine with me.</li>
      <li>The spray came out so evenly that it was fun to use.</li>
      <li>It uses no artificial colors or synthetic fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sunscreen has a pleasant slightly coconut scent.  </li>
      <li>I know people like spray sunscreens because it goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t end up getting your hands all greasy from applying a lotion, but I prefer being able to see where I&#x27;ve applied it to avoid the mystery sunburn that you don&#x27;t realize you&#x27;ve gotten until the next day!</li>
      <li>The SPF rating is high, good for when you have long sun exposure</li>
      <li>This kept the sun away from me completely, has a fresh light scent and is greaaseless.  </li>
      <li>It works well, is easy to apply, with no mess &amp; nothing to rinse or rub off my hands afterwards.</li>
      <li>Both have very capable products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant and not strong in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This includes individuals with dermatitis herpetiformis.&lt;br /&gt;According to Dr. Alessio Fasano, Medical Director of the Center for Celiac Research, University of Maryland, “If you have celiac disease, then the application of gluten containing products to the skin should not be a problem, unless you have skin lesions that allow gluten to be absorbed systemically in great quantities.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, when you apply it, do it outside, pay attention to where the wind will blow it, and don&#x27;t breathe, because it smells overwhelmingly of alcohol.</li>
      <li>It applies like most sprays (do they all get the sprays from the same place??).  </li>
      <li>Covers very well without streaking!</li>
      <li>the lotion works much better as a sunscreen especially for the beach or pool.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I want it to do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I gave this stuff the ultimate test. I took our extremely white family to a water park for all day. We only applied this once before getting started and never reapplied. I used a different non-spray kind for my face and this kind for our bodies. I was impressed that it did not leave a smell after the initial spray settled on our body. It feels a little oily upon application, but it soaks in after a bit. I did not feel weird or greasy the rest of the day. I didn&#x27;t even realize it was still there. It applied SUPER easy and very even. I did not have to rub it in. I just sprayed and went. I did spray too much on one place and I just rubbed it in and was fine. After we were done, I could not even tell we had been in the sun. If you are after a real tan, this is probably not for you. This stuff prevented any of us from suffering any lingering affects from all day sun exposure and being in the water where it could have worn off. That also tells me that it went on evenly enough to not miss places. I did not have any weird places accidentally missed. My husband did have one weird place on his face that got burned where he missed using the other kind we used for our faces. I know that this spray works better than the lotion because you don&#x27;t have to really try so hard to get every place. I have tried other sprays before like Coppertone, but I found it harder to apply. I also like that this one has a lid that you can twist to off so that it doesn&#x27;t spray while in your bag.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  It is not sticky and hasn&#x27;t clogged once.  The SPF is perfect for me because I burn very easily.  Unfortunately, most of the higher SPF are so thick that I can&#x27;t stand the feel of it.  This is just as light as the Hawaiian Tropic SPF 8.  It&#x27;s also not oily.  Overall, I have really enjoyed this and will probably purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> Sprays easily, doesn&#x27;t get clogged up, even after being in a beach bag and in the sand (I wiped it off before going home and it worked fine the next day). Would be a 4-star product except the smell...it&#x27;s VERY coconutty. I smelled like a Mai Tai. Yeah, not always a bad thing (yum, Mai Tais!) but it&#x27;s pretty overwhelming, even for someone with a bad sense of smell. Kind of reminded me of the products we used in the 80&#x27;s -- all tropical, all the time. Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty solid product.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use product that dispenses a good amount of liquid that I use on my face and arms prior to going into the sun.  The packaging is nice, the spray volume more than adequate, and the product goes on easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble with the product is the smell.  It&#x27;s a power, sort of unpleasant smell.  It&#x27;s not horrible, it just has an odor that is no to my liking</li>
    <li> Alba Botanica has several beautifully engineered products.  Terrific shampoo and conditioner, solid moisturizers, and a nice face cleanser.  They have many SPF sunscreen products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, for a sunscreen, has an acceptable smell.  It is less off-putting than many sunscreens.  It feels ok on the skin for being such a high SPF, and it seems to work very well.  I believe as a spray-on sunscreen, the product would work well for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, one of the major aspects that I found attractive of Alba Botanica was the fact they have 100% Vegetarian Ingredients and not tested on animals.  This is probably true for the Alba Botanica labeled products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Alba Botanica is only a brand of the Hain Celestial Group.  Alba Botanica does not seem to be its own company, just a brand of Hain Celestial.  The problem is Hain Celestial also owns turkey and chicken meat brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem spending money on &amp;#34;vegetarian&amp;#34; products when the same headquarters are profiting from animal slaughter.  Furthermore, while I cannot vouch for the authenticity, I read an online blog of a partnership Hain has in Asia, and that company may or may not test on animals, it was not clear.  In other words, Hain is a very large company and much more than a vegetarian personal care products company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Alba Botanica has some beautifully engineered products.  However, it&#x27;s simply a line or brand from Hain Celestial which makes my stomach uneasy. Our family plans to use up the Alba Botanica products remaining in our home, and then move elsewhere. Kiss My Face might be one option.  A second option is 100% Pure brand.  Both have very capable products.  Perhaps, someday, Alba Botanica could be spun off into its own company or purchased by someone else.</li>
    <li> When buying a new sunscreen product, my hope is always to find one that has the light texture of the dry oil products for hair. While Alba Botanica Hawaiian comes close, it still leaves a detectable film on the skin. The thing I dislike about the feeling is that when at the beach, the salt and sand adheres to it. That said, this sunscreen has a nice, light scent that is not cloying. I haven&#x27;t tested it to the limits of its SPF rating, but, so far, so good. It works well around the pool, and I haven&#x27;t burned yet, which is saying something. I&#x27;d buy it again, but am still looking for a sunscreen that won&#x27;t leave my face feeling yucky.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen made by alba Botanica. The single-touch sprayer works with no problems. The sunscreen went on smooth, isn&#x27;t oily at all. It dries quickly and has a nice light coconut scent. It&#x27;s spf 50 so should keep you protected when under the harsh rays of the sun. It&#x27;s also water resistant for up to 80 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you prefer eco-friendly products, this is your sunscreen. It has an aerosol free sprayer. It uses no chemical or flammable propellants. It consists of 100% vegetarian ingredients, so no animal testing.  It uses no artificial colors or synthetic fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and the price is competitive with like products.</li>
    <li> This is light sunscreen.  It sprays on evenly and does not feel &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34;.  Although there was no reason to rub it in I did a few time to spread the oil and was not left with sticky residue on my hand.  The only drawback for me is that the smell was not that appealing. The way I choose sunscreen is the SPF and the smell and this particular sunscreen advertises coconut oil.  This sunscreen is supposed to be all natural and vegan so I am sure that is why there is no artificially manufactured &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; smell infused within it.  As a consumer if you are interested in this product you are more than likely looking for a less harmful all natural alternative for what is currently available in stores.  This is a good option smell notwithstanding.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and burn easily.  This kept the sun away from me completely, has a fresh light scent and is greaaseless.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We received a can of &amp;#34;Alba Botanica Hawaiian, Coconut Spray Sunscreen SPF 50, 6 Ounce&amp;#34; via the Vine program to evaluate, and we were initially excited to extend our experience with Alba Botanica&#x27;s products. Then, we researched the active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;First, the ingredients, straight from Alba Botanica:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient: Homosalate - 15.0% (Sunscreen), Octocrylene - 8.0% (Sunscreen), Ethylhexyl Salicylate - 5.0% (Sunscreen), Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane - 3.0% (Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Alcohol Denat, Acrylates/Octylacrylamide Copolymer, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Diisopropyl Adipate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Coumarin, Anisyl Alcohol&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The main active ingredient, Homosalate, may possibly break down into toxic compounds as well as have negative impact on androgen and estrogen receptors...nothing proven, it seems, but there us enough on the web to urge caution in its use.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that Octocrylene, the second active ingredient, contributes to the increased production of free radicals under illumination...which can lead to DNA damage.&lt;br /&gt;This was enough to help us decide to not use the spray any more; it also has us rethinking our use of the many other Alba Botanica (and Hain Celestial Group, who bought them) products.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a pleasant slightly coconut scent.  It goes on easily and does not feel at all oily.  It is SPF 50 which is pretty good protection.  I also like the fact that it is &amp;#34;vegetarian&amp;#34; and not animal tested.  Overall I found nothing negative about this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I love Alba lip products, they always smell great. I love the smell of this sunscreen too: it smells how sunscreen should smell, like your at the beach! For me, there is a certain nostalgia that goes along with using sunscreen that smells like this.I don&#x27;t love spray on sun screens, as a rule: I just feel the coverage isn&#x27;t as good as smearing on a lotion, and that a lot of product goes to waste, spraying everywhere but on your skin.  So that is a drawback to this product for me personally. But overall, it seems to do the job, and I felt protected on my shoulders especially after a day outside. I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde with very fair freckled skin, living in the South, so I get a lot of sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that there are concerns about some of the ingredients in this sunscreen. I don&#x27;t use sun screen everyday, and I&#x27;m not putting this on a very young child. Not that I don&#x27;t think these concerns are valid, I just don&#x27;t think they apply to me personally. There are plenty of sites you can use to find out about the products and chemicals we use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do question why a sunscreen needs to be &amp;#34;gluten-free.&amp;#34;  Most people do NOT have gluten sensitivities, and certainly, I don&#x27;t imagine there are many people in this world that have a contact sensitivity to gluten on their skin.  Out of curiosity, I did a quick Google search on the topic, and came up with this from Gluten Free Dietician: Personal Care Products: Do You Need to Worry About Gluten?&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: There is no scientific evidence that the use of gluten-containing products that are not ingested is harmful to persons with celiac disease. This includes individuals with dermatitis herpetiformis.&lt;br /&gt;According to Dr. Alessio Fasano, Medical Director of the Center for Celiac Research, University of Maryland, “If you have celiac disease, then the application of gluten containing products to the skin should not be a problem, unless you have skin lesions that allow gluten to be absorbed systemically in great quantities.&lt;br /&gt;“The reason why this should not be a problem is that, based on what we know right now, it is the oral ingestion of gluten that activates the immunological cascades leading to the autoimmune process typical of celiac disease.”&lt;br /&gt;There aren’t too many individuals on the planet who know more about celiac disease than Dr. Fasano, so please, do not let anyone, including medical professionals convince you that gluten protein can be absorbed through the skin and cause a celiac disease reaction. It simply isn’t true.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.glutenfreedietitian.com/personal-care-products-do-you-need-to-worry-about-gluten/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. This is simply another marketing ploy to sell product.  It really does not matter, even if you have a specific gluten allergy, or condition, if you put gluten on your skin.  Unless you have open sores, and I don&#x27;t think you should be spraying a chemical like sunscreen on those sores anyway.to be absorbed systemically in great quantities.&lt;br /&gt;“The reason why this should not be a problem is that, based on what we know right now, it is the oral ingestion of gluten that activates the immunological cascades leading to the autoimmune process typical of celiac disease.”&lt;br /&gt;There aren’t too many individuals on the planet who know more about celiac disease than Dr. Fasano, so please, do not let anyone, including medical professionals convince you that gluten protein can be absorbed through the skin and cause a celiac disease reaction.

    <li> My kids claim it looks shinier on their skin than other sprays. The smell is great. Hard to say if it actually works any better than other brands, but we didn&#x27;t notice any unexpected sun burns (we&#x27;re in S. California). 6 oz. goes fast, which makes me appreciate all the &amp;#34;bonus size&amp;#34; offers I see in the stores for other brands.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily or messy. Spray is convenient but can be somewhat wasteful. Have to like the scent of coconut.</li>
    <li> Review of:  Alba Botanica Hawaiian, Coconut Spray Sunscreen SPF 50, 6 Ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that Alba claims that it is an all natural (vegetarian) sun screen.  I have read that the company tries to cut down on the synthetic materials used in similar products offered for sale.  I decided to try this sunscreen hoping to find a product that can strike a balance between effectiveness and toxins.  After use I found that the sunscreen works well (SPF-50) protecting the skin.  The fragrance is that of light coconut and is pleasant.  In terms of convenience the spray feature is excellent to cover exposed skin in an expeditious manner.  If you need a product that you can employ immediately at baseball games, parks, etc. and feel confident it is fairly safe then this is the one for you.  I am pleased.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> I liked this sunscreen product for a number of reasons: to begin with, it isn&#x27;t an oil or a cream.  When you spray it on, it&#x27;s quickly absorbed and more or less disappears into the skin. It seems to last most of the day, once applied.  It claims to be water resistant for up to 80 minutes--I haven&#x27;t put it to the test for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level of protection is high (SPF 50)--as high as practical coverage gets.  The scent of the spray is subtly coconut that is very pleasant, but not overpowering.  The manufacturer claims that the spray contains NO parabens or phthalates and that it does not use animal testing.  It carries that warning that the spray is flammable--so smokers beware when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to evaluate, but I would buy this product on my own once the sample is gone.</li>
    <li> Like most sunscreens, it&#x27;s a little hard to tell with this product what is important and what is marketing hype. This sunscreen has a nice, understated coconut smell that makes it pleasant when you put it on but fades into the background so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It sprays on nicely, without any oil or other substance that you need to rub in. Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to its vegetarian nature, and to its ingredients, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s any better than other products or not.</li>
    <li> This smells really good and applies super easily without leaving you choking on a noxious cloud. It&#x27;s sweat and water resistant for 80 minutes. My husband and I recently wore it to a big festival on a blazingly hot and humid day. We were walking to different vendors for 2 and a half hours, without reapplying mind you, and this kept us protected when I burn at the drop of a hat. Now our faces were protected by hats but my arms, chest and back were still exposed but left the pale color they started out at.</li>
    <li> YES. This sunscreen is not only all natural, it smells AMAZING -- like the sand, sun and coconuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in LA, I use sunscreen daily and I am very sensitive to some ingredients in most commercial sunscreens. I had been using Babyganic, which I also really like, but I think I&#x27;ll switch to Alba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, from this line I really like the face wipes!</li>
    <li> I found the smell fine and the bottle easy to hold (in spite of damp hands from humidity and heat). I do like the spray option but there are some concerns with that form of sunscreen as far as safety. In addition it is hard to determine what&#x27;s got sunscreen and what doesn&#x27;t as far as skin. The reason I choose spray, rather than lotion, is that it overall seems less messy and sticky. With this spray I had to kind of &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; where I put it - the spray goes on sticky so it&#x27;s not hard to feel where it might be. It seemed to work well - no sunburn or even much tan which is fine with me. Overall this is an ok product - it does not look like it contains some of the ingredients it did last year that caused some consumers to question it&#x27;s safety. Due to coverage and the fact I still cannot escape the sticky hands syndrome I would likely choose lotion over this form of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Parents, if you are tired of attempting to smooth sunscreen lotion all over your kids before they run sprinting off into the water, this may be the solution for you. Though I have tried other brands of spray on sunscreen and been disappointed that you have to actually rub the spray into the skin still, this one actually lives up to its promise. It emits a very fine spray that coats the skin evenly on the first pass. It seemed effective when I tested it on our first hot summer day two days ago; nobody got any sunburn on our trip to the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two things I don&#x27;t like about it have to do with the smell. First, when you apply it, do it outside, pay attention to where the wind will blow it, and don&#x27;t breathe, because it smells overwhelmingly of alcohol. Second, the fragrance itself when sitting on your skin smells like really cheap air freshener. When I think of Alba Botanica, I think of natural products, so I didn&#x27;t expect to have something that smells like glade air freshener sitting on my skin. That said, if you are outside at the beach, you may not even notice the fragrance. Given how easy it is to apply and use, I hope the company plans to make an unscented version or one that is fragranced with only essential oils such as lavender.</li>
    <li> Covers very well without streaking! Love it! AND smells delicious too.</li>
    <li> While I enjoy the smell of this sunscreen, I do not enjoy false advertisement. The bottle says biodegradable in the picture, but it actually isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great spray and I love the coconut smell!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety rating apparently isn&#x27;t that high but I personally don&#x27;t worry much about this as the protection is more important than avoiding certain bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Like being in the Carribean, works great</li>
    <li> I purchased this to toss in my diaper bag for my son.... It works well, is easy to apply, with no mess &amp; nothing to rinse or rub off my hands afterwards. LOVE that this is AIR POWERED &amp; AEROSOL FREE!!!</li>
    <li> super nice... works well</li>
    <li> Used twice and can was empty.</li>
    <li> Great convenience and smell but the lotion works much better as a sunscreen especially for the beach or pool.</li>
    <li> Nice smell (only mildly coconutty) and good coverage. It feels a bit sticky when you first spray it on, but as it dried it becomes less so. As any other spray sunscreen, it can be hard to tell where you&#x27;re getting it and what spots you&#x27;re missing, so you could end up with some weird-looking sunburns. I know people like spray sunscreens because it goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t end up getting your hands all greasy from applying a lotion, but I prefer being able to see where I&#x27;ve applied it to avoid the mystery sunburn that you don&#x27;t realize you&#x27;ve gotten until the next day!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I went into our pool on a very sunny day for about 4 hours and I didn&#x27;t turn red at all. I burn immediately and then go back to my normal color. It&#x27;s pretty frustrating. I try not to burn so hard. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shock of how cold it was at first was surprising but not unexpected. I was just hoping I&#x27;d get enough coverage! I definitely did. It worked so well. I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant and not strong in my opinion. It does exactly what I want it to do. I can&#x27;t wait for another sunny pool day!!!</li>
    <li> I did visit the EWG&#x27;s website before starting to write my review, and I think that based on their writings , as well as my use of the product, that I will still rate this 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells great, and it is in a spray form which makes it easy to go on. I use it as an every day sunscreen and I ok with it having inhalants etc. I think that we have to weigh the risks vs benefits. One of the EWGs concerns is that it doesn&#x27;t go on as intended and you may inhale the contents. I spritz it on outside and I use the product while zipping around on errands. I feel that for me, I prefer having something on, than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the EWG actually has a list of sunscreens that one can purchase through Amazon.com. Great list as there are some brands I have never heard of.</li>
    <li> This Alba Botanica spray is an excellent sunscreen item. First, it is aerosol, so it does not need pump action - just gently press the bottom and it works. Also, the aerosol is &amp;#34;air powered&amp;#34; so it is environmentally safe.  Also, the cap has a twist closure so it will not accidentally spray during travel - my favorite item about the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it does NOT have any paragons or phthalates which are harmful, especially to children. It is called &amp;#34;hawaiian&amp;#34; because it has coconut oil, which is highly nourishing for the skin, but at the same time the scent is not overpowering. This sunscreen is go for active use, and water resistant for up to 80 minutes. Do not spray directly on the face - spray it into your hands and then rub onto the face. This is fast drying, but it suggests that you put it on 15 minutes before going into the water to make sure it is fully dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband sweats heavily and has to do lots of outdoor work, and he really likes this and said it stayed on and kept him from getting a sunburn, so we really like this.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies to perfumes, so I’m wary to try new products. I was impressed. The scent was very light, and not like a typical sunscreen. The sunscreen was so silky that I sprayed it on a friend, so that she could test it. The spray came out so evenly that it was fun to use. Definitely the best can of spray sunscreen ever, and best of all we didn’t burn.</li>
    <li> QUICK SUMMARY:  Easy-on, very eco-minded product, but it&#x27;s pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACKGROUND:  Most everyone in my family got to try this item out, either around our pool or at the beach.  Overall consensus is that we like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT WE LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to apply, just sprays on&lt;br /&gt;- Seems more ecologically minded than most products of its kind&lt;br /&gt;- The SPF rating is high, good for when you have long sun exposure&lt;br /&gt;- The water resistance seemed on par with other, similar products we use&lt;br /&gt;- No one got sun burned, even hours in the sun (with re-application after 80 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- No one complained of having it sting their eyes (when sprayed onto one&#x27;s hand and gently rubbed onto one&#x27;s face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT WE DIDN&#x27;T LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little sticky once it&#x27;s dried on your skin&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;ve applied this product all over your skin, unlike lotions where you have more control&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s expensive; I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase this item after the review sample is used up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  Seems like a good product overall, although it&#x27;s more expensive than other, less-easy-to-use products that are just as effective.</li>
    <li> I love Alba Bontanica coconut oil, so I thought I would love, love, love this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;SPF of 50&lt;br /&gt;Sprays easily&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells less like the oil and more like coconut oil ala early 90&#x27;s - it&#x27;s a bit...loud smelling - less every day and more hanging out at the beach&lt;br /&gt;Felt a little sticky to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the scent is not as pleasant as the oil, and while it is easy to use - it&#x27;s too much money for a sunscreen for me unless it smelled a bit more pleasant.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen worked well for me.  Went out golfing with it on and was not burnt anywhere (since it is SPF 50 - I wasn&#x27;t even tanned).  It applies like most sprays (do they all get the sprays from the same place??).  You spray it on and optionally rub it in (if you think you may have missed somewhere).  It is not greasy and dries quickly.  It has a nice light coconut smell.  Not the chemically strong smell of some sport ones or the sand/beach smell of some other ones.  Just a light pleasant smell.</li>
</ol>
