      <li>Giving it four stars as there are reports that say it includes some harmful ingredients called sodium laurel sulfate that is used to make it penetrate into skin better and cause allergic reaction or skin irritations.  </li>

      <li>Best product around for keeping your skin smooth and to prevent dry itch.</li>

      <li>It was recomended by my dermatologist and I liked it so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cetaphil is widely available.</li>
      <li>We tried it out and it helped heal the rashes and keep the skin itch free.</li>
      <li>Great in all seasons, but especially winter.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin smooth and moisturizes for upwards of 24 hours.</li>
      <li>It has no fragrance but is absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>Good lotion for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am a very senior citizen and need extra help with dryness of my skin and this product is perfect.</li>

      <li>Everyone love it so much we have to buy these in 3X packs!</li>
      <li>I stopped buying face moisturizers from Clinique, and switched to this one instead, it feels amazing on my face; I live in Utah (desert)</li>

      <li>it!i bought it for my bb,and it&#x27;s useful</li>
      <li>Been using this for while and helps a lot with my eczema, 100% far better then 99% of the stop you buy at a retail store</li>
      <li>back is an area that gives me problems, the cream in the tub will adhere to an applicator (I think mine was a kind of plastic icing spatula) and allows me to apply to unreachable places with no dripping or wastage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am an avid and loyal user of Curel Itch Relief.</li>
      <li>THE PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin and for people that are sensitive to products with chemicals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for all seasons, provided it&#x27;s always so dry in USA.</li>

      <li>exactly what i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for more than 10 years now because it is a very mild moisturising cream that prevents my sensitive skin from being dry.</li>

      <li>No other lotion, however rich it was, helped.</li>
      <li>I can tell a huge difference in my skin after the first use and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
      <li>without slathering on large amounts</li>

    <li> Works so will with my daughters extra dry skin.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for dry, scaly, and cracked skin. I have ichthyosis and this has been my go to cream for years. It&#x27;s the only thing that works in those dry winter months and keeps me from wanting to scratch my skin off.  This stuff is amazing, fast absorbing and stays with you all day. I can tell a huge difference in my skin after the first use and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Tha best moisturizing cream!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best moisturizing cream I have every tried.  Everyone in the family love this product.  It feels very natural and works great.  No sticky, oily feel to it at all.  Everyone love it so much we have to buy these in 3X packs!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product</li>
    <li> Item received as described and on time!</li>
    <li> Good cream for winter dryness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for more than 10 years now because it is a very mild moisturising cream that prevents my sensitive skin from being dry.</li>
    <li> All of my family member can use it.</li>
    <li> It was recomended by my dermatologist and I liked it so much. It&#x27;s an excelent product for dry skin and has a good price.</li>
    <li> our  whole family uses  this whole family.  it doesn&#x27;t smell, feels  nice, does  what it is meant to  do,  and doesn&#x27;t anger our  allergies.</li>
    <li> All Cetaphil products are recommended by my Dermatologist.  Their soap is also great.  Better than the more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I have tried many.  Cetaphil really works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your hand slimy.  I buy it for my very elderly father also, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil religiously for several years and my skin feels and looks amazing.  I apply it twice daily</li>
    <li> love it. exactly what i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;love it.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my baby skin feel great works well as she has eczema and it helps to keep her skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and love what it does for my skin. I am a very senior citizen and need extra help with dryness of my skin and this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> My toddler had moderately bad eczema and none of the lotions/creams I was using was helping. Within 2 days of using this, the eczema started clearing up and she vastly reduced her scratching. A little over a month after using it (after every diaper change), everything is cleared up and the scars are starting to clear away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years. It has no fragrance but is absolutely fantastic. It can be used all over the body and for face. Keeps skin smooth and moisturizes for upwards of 24 hours. Highly recommend, especially if you live in a cold climate and it is winter.</li>
    <li> Having tried many different makes and types of product for sensitive dry flaky skin, Cetaphil Moisturising Cream does the business.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for keeping eczema at bay and keeping your skin thoroughly moisturised.</li>
    <li> very useful and great product. my husband and my son like to use it in winter. I am so happy that I bought it at a great deal price.</li>
    <li> my dd has dry sensitive skin. 1 month of continous use, and it has worked wonders :) . . .  her skin now feels great</li>
    <li> My kids were getting rashes in the winter due to very dry skin. No other lotion, however rich it was, helped. Pediatrician recommended anti-itch medication and Cetaphil as it is an emollient and not a regular moisturizer. She explained how it worked on the skin. We tried it out and it helped heal the rashes and keep the skin itch free. We continue to use this and will not use anything else. It is unscented and rich so a little goes a long way. Great price on amazon and with the bulk purchase of 3, the savings comes to about $7 a jar (For what it is sold in my area).</li>
    <li> Awesome got 3 for the price of 1</li>
    <li> It is a good product, and used it for my daughter before ........ good experience with the seller</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> Gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin soft will buy again</li>
    <li> I have used cetaphil for the past 4 yrs. Since my child was an infant.  I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> i love it!i bought it for my bb,and it&#x27;s useful</li>
    <li> There is only one Cetaphil. Best product around for keeping your skin smooth and to prevent dry itch. Stay with the fragance free cream, not the pump bottles or tubes. This three pack is the best price I could find anywhere, and I saved about $15 over buying it at the big box drug store.</li>
    <li> The best of its kind.  Not greasy, not slimy, and doesn&#x27;t stain either.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil more than 35-40 years and love it!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil  used it for years and will continue/great price/fast delivery  Appreciate it</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a long time. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I like it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping n items as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great. Skin is never dry. Soaks in fast, doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily. Great in all seasons, but especially winter.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I also have to congratulate the shipping dept.  In all the terrible snow upon snow that has piled up at my home, the shipment was one day later than expected.  There was one day when we had no plow or anything else and everything was icy!  Spring will be MOST WELCOME!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me for my entire body. I used to get it at Walmart, but they don&#x27;t carry it at my store anymore. So I found it here. It is the best cream, but only in the jar, not bottle, that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> good product. mom and I love this. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good lotion for sensitive skin.  We either buy this or Vanicream, depending on price, they are the same for our needs.</li>
    <li> great product, use it all over my body</li>
    <li> My university roommates all love this product. Simple, fragrance-free, easy to apply, and very effective to protect skin against any unfriendly weather. I will keep on using it everyday.</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended, best product I have used.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and for people that are sensitive to products with chemicals.</li>
    <li> Product review is for the 3 pack of the 1 lbs tubs of fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between age, allergies and allergy meds, dry skin has been a progressively bigger problem every few years. I do not have rashes or scaling or medical problems that require fancy solutions. The itching can be distracting and even wake me from deep sleep. Having tried many alternatives Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream addresses all of my needs with the least side effects. The tub seems to me as the most efficient container and the most flexible for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically what I like:&lt;br /&gt;Fast relief&lt;br /&gt;Little or no residue&lt;br /&gt;No Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Relief without slathering on large amounts&lt;br /&gt;My back is an area that gives me problems, the cream in the tub will adhere to an applicator (I think mine was a kind of plastic icing spatula) and allows me to apply to unreachable places with no dripping or wastage.&lt;br /&gt;No other product I have tried is close on all the above criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil is widely available. Evan at Amazon I have seen wide variations in prices and some of the higher prices do not come with free shipping. The 3 pack seems to be the best deal and as of today may be better priced than local brick and mortar stores . Shoppers do your shopping. What is in the 16 ounce tub of Cetaphil is the same everywhere. Shopping around can save you as much as 50% per tub.</li>
    <li> Lotion. If you&#x27;re using anything else on your skin you&#x27;re doing it wrong. THis is amazing, never gives me a rash, I throw some scented oil on the tip, mix it around with my finger, and I have the best, most luxuriant body lotion in the world.</li>
    <li> Es una crema sin aroma, con buena consistencia, buen tamaño y lo mejor me ha funcionado de maravilla durante mis dos embarazos, sin estrías, no requiero aplicarla varias veces al dia, porque la piel no me picaba y siempre permanecía bien humectada.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Was recommended by my dermatologist. Keeps skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Been using this for while and helps a lot with my eczema, 100% far better then 99% of the stop you buy at a retail store</li>
    <li> This great product helps with eczema skin, even of the dry, grey, scaly variety. Sometimes you have to schlak it on per the doctor until the skin recovers them follow with &#x27;normal&#x27; application. He was right!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with skin that get so dry in winter it burns and &#x27;tears&#x27;. Heavier application may be necessary for soothing and healing. As always, applying right after a shower/bath is best for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price, though fluctuating with their subscription, is competitive thus far.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist for my dry skin... really works great!</li>
    <li> The moisturizing cream is good ,I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only skin moisturiser that makes my skin soft and gives it a shine all day. It really works and I wouldn&#x27;t be with a few jars around the house.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> as always this cream is wonderful....we both use it daily and it helps with very dry skin problems. love it...</li>
    <li> Love Cetaphil, we use this cream daily on my two little ones and myself. I stopped buying face moisturizers from Clinique, and switched to this one instead, it feels amazing on my face; I live in Utah (desert) so we need extra moisture all the time. With Clinique I had apply 2 to 3 times a day in order to feel my face moisturized, I even tried the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief, but nothing worked like plain Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> use it on my toddler and myself. hydrates effectively, no skin side effect and helps with dry patches.  great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for all seasons, provided it&#x27;s always so dry in USA.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works very well no matter what weather we&#x27;re experiencing.  I&#x27;ve been using all Cetaphil products for about 7 years now and wouldn&#x27;t trust anything else on my skin.  I LOVE IT!!!  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am an avid and loyal user of Curel Itch Relief. I got this as a great deal on Amazon so I thought I would give it a try.  Well, I don&#x27;t think this brand is as moisturizing as Curel, but it is a good cream. No scent for those who are sensitive and a little goes a long way. Not sure if I am converted from Curel, but a decent alternative.</li>
    <li> I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FRAGRANCE FREE MOISTURIZING CREAMS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!  THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND IT WILL LAST YOU A LONG TIME.........THANK YOU, AMAZON:)))))))</li>
    <li> The moisturer can be lasted for one full day. Does not need to apply  a thick layer on the face or body. Just normal apply will do.  After 2 weeks,  able to see the charges on my skin. My skin no longer feel and appear dry.</li>
    <li> great for dry skin all over the body. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, Excellent buy and already seeing improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for our daughter since her birth.  Our daughter does not stay still so there is very precious time to apply it so I prefer this one over the pump style as I can scoop a big chunk of cream fast.  No skin irritation for my daughter so far so we use this as a default moisturizer for our daughter.  Buying it at amazon saves money so we order pack of 3 at a time.  Giving it four stars as there are reports that say it includes some harmful ingredients called sodium laurel sulfate that is used to make it penetrate into skin better and cause allergic reaction or skin irritations.  Our friend stays away from Cetaphil due to this and recommends physiogel but we have seen no negative symptoms so we are still using Cetaphil as physiogel costs a lot more.</li>
    <li> Cream was recommended by dermatologist. So far I really like.</li>
    <li> For my kids, very good moisturising cream.</li>
    <li> Great value on Cetaphil which was recommended by my dermatologist. I have used previously and bought through Amazon as the 3-pak value was terrific. Non scented, creamy, and does a great job on moisturizing.</li>
