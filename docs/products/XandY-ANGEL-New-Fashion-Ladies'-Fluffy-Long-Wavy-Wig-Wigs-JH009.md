      <li>really cute</li>
      <li>I was wig shopping for a long time for the perfect and I stumbled upon this one.</li>
      <li>I put it on as soon as I got in the door with it, brushed it out a bit and am so so incredibly</li>
      <li>I wore a hat with it and it looks fine now.</li>
      <li>I got light brown</li>
      <li>Fast shipping from China was a bonus!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and such a cheap price, definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>cause it&#x27;s very comfortable and looks surprisingly real.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty great wig especially for the price.</li>
      <li>i really think its cute</li>
      <li>If you want a believable wig that looks like real hair this is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I like it, but i recieved the dark brown one instead of the light brown one.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good wig.</li>
      <li>This is a very good quality wig, plenty of hair, but it is MUCH darker brown and has a slight reddish hue.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it any time!!!</li>
      <li>Thanks for the really quick delivery!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a pretty cool wig</li>
      <li>The wig is very soft and i just love the pretty waves.</li>
      <li>Not too shiny or plasticy, and just the right amount of curl.</li>
      <li>All the reviews were so right about this wig.</li>
      <li>Nice volume and its quite long.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely adore it!</li>
      <li>AND it looks exactly like the picture posted.</li>
      <li>This is my first wig purchase</li>
      <li>I have had it on all day and everyone thought it was my real hair!</li>
      <li>Highly suggest this for anyone looking for a wig for fun or whatever occasion.</li>
      <li>It is soft, natural feeling, and just plain beautiful.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that it&#x27;d be a lighter shade somewhere in between blonde and light brown but was actually a lighter auburn color/orange, this is my own error and my ipad might&#x27;ve registered the color differently than intended in the pictures.&lt;br</li>
      <li>People think it&#x27;s my real hair when I wear it.</li>
      <li>coloring your real hair ladies</li>
      <li>It looks like real hair and feels like it</li>
      <li>It does get tangled easily but long wigs and hair tend to do this.</li>
      <li>a little too orange on the top but its</li>
      <li>It came in two weeks early!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to style, feels very silky and has a slight layered cut to it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for use in a professional stage play and was fully prepared to not use it if it didn&#x27;t look real.</li>
      <li>Although be careful about colors because I ordered light brown when it was available and got dark brown.</li>
      <li>I like this wig, but I ordered light brown and it cam dark brown.</li>
      <li>I ordered this in light brown, but it came as dark brown</li>
      <li>Wow, this really is a soft wig, it&#x27;s a dark brown with a light brown sheen, I got this for a friend and she likes the &amp;#34;soft curls.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>the only thing is that i have to play with it a bit to get it too look real.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and looks completely natural.</li>
      <li>The wig in person is a few shades darker with a light hit of red but still gorious (just to let you know before you buy).</li>
      <li>The color to be more precise is darker then dirty blonde but lighter than regular brown.</li>
      <li>I was schocked at how pretty, LONG, REAL, THICK, and so worth it</li>

    <li> Its great to spice things up but its not so easy to maintain</li>
    <li> I like it, but i recieved the dark brown one instead of the light brown one.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good wig. Not too shiny or plasticy, and just the right amount of curl.</li>
    <li> I was wig shopping for a long time for the perfect and I stumbled upon this one. It&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL! That&#x27;s all I have to say about it. Just perfect. It looks like real hair and feels like it AND it looks exactly like the picture posted. The only thing that wasn&#x27;t like the picture was the hair color, it&#x27;s not exactly the same 6.6. The wig in person is a few shades darker with a light hit of red but still gorious (just to let you know before you buy). The color to be more precise is darker then dirty blonde but lighter than regular brown. In all, this wig is the best when it comes to craftsmanship and quality ^-^. The timing was shocking wonderful too! It came in two weeks early!! If you want a believable wig that looks like real hair this is worth every penny. Trust me you will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig last week and I got it today and I absolutely adore it! I have had it on all day and everyone thought it was my real hair! It&#x27;s soft and looks completely natural. The bangs were a bit long but I cut them and I could not be happier. I would recommend this wig. It&#x27;s beautiful and such a cheap price, definitely worth it. I will be buying more wigs from this seller (:</li>
    <li> Not as pictured at all. Cute ... I bought to test hair colors before I dyed it. This just didn&#x27;t turn out as expected.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!! All the reviews were so right about this wig. Did I say wig, I mean hair. When I got it it was perfectly wrapped so there were no tangles, it was in a hair net. When I took it out I was like a kid in a candy store, happy, that&#x27;s an understatement!!!!!!  I was schocked at how pretty, LONG, REAL, THICK, and so worth it this was. I though at worst I would have it to wear on halloween. NO WAY!!!! The quality and style is AWESOME. Don&#x27;t think twice about this, it&#x27;s perfect. It even has webbing inside to hook together to keep on your head instead of being loaded with bobby pins. You will LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!! But when I put it on, I did scare my dog. She looked at me strange and backed up...Ha! Ha! I got this after crying after the hair loss I had with the bad haircut, I could have told her to just shave off and finish it. This makes it all better!!!</li>
    <li> The wig is very soft and i just love the pretty waves. I wish the color was a tad lighter but its a keeper none the less. Nice volume and its quite long. I bought 3 wigs from this company already. I was only disappointed with one, and its not this one.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality wig, plenty of hair, but it is MUCH darker brown and has a slight reddish hue. This is NOT light brown. Aside from this, the quality is great!</li>
    <li> really cute i love it! the only thing is that i have to play with it a bit to get it too look real. a little too orange on the top but its okay i really think its cute</li>
    <li> I like this wig, but I ordered light brown and it cam dark brown. It&#x27;s a little itchy and you can see the wig on the hair line. Not the wig cap, the wig. I wore a hat with it and it looks fine now. But over all it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous wig! I purchased this for use in a professional stage play and was fully prepared to not use it if it didn&#x27;t look real. It&#x27;s beautiful! I placed my order late night on November 1st. It shipped Nov 3 and arrived Nov 20.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really is a soft wig, it&#x27;s a dark brown with a light brown sheen, I got this for a friend and she likes the &amp;#34;soft curls.&amp;#34; Thanks for the really quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Fabulously sexy!!! Love it love it love it. I highly recommend it any time!!! It&#x27;s fabulous and sexy! Nice nice</li>
    <li> For the price that I got it($18.95) it&#x27;s a really nice quality. There was also a wig cap included and that was a kind gesture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to style, feels very silky and has a slight layered cut to it. The curls are very nice and stayed wavy even after messing around with it. I was hoping that it&#x27;d be a lighter shade somewhere in between blonde and light brown but was actually a lighter auburn color/orange, this is my own error and my ipad might&#x27;ve registered the color differently than intended in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> fits well, looks good, and my daughter has received lots of compliments from her friends.  This is way better than hacking/coloring your real hair ladies/girls.  Fast shipping from China was a bonus!!!</li>
    <li> I have a serious addiction to dying my hair -- And, finally it fried! So I had no choice but to shave it. Hence began my quest for a wig. I am so happy I purchased this one. It is soft, natural feeling, and just plain beautiful. It fit perfectly -- I didn&#x27;t have to make any sizing adjustments. I put it on as soon as I got in the door with it, brushed it out a bit and am so so incredibly happy!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived way sooner than the Amazon Shipping Estimate (was estimated for June 17th) and came to day, May 16th. Affordable, wonderful, and adorable! I&#x27;m in love! Highly suggest this for anyone looking for a wig for fun or whatever occasion.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Gorgeous shape, great color! It does get tangled easily but long wigs and hair tend to do this. It looks so great people thought It was my hair. I will be using this as my go to costume wig or if I am too lazy to do my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty great wig especially for the price. People think it&#x27;s my real hair when I wear it. Although be careful about colors because I ordered light brown when it was available and got dark brown. But it&#x27;s a pretty cool wig and I wasn&#x27;t picky so I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in light brown, but it came as dark brown, that&#x27;s why the 4 stars instead of 5...It still really beautiful!! I decided to keep it cause it&#x27;s very comfortable and looks surprisingly real. LOVE this style!!!! Great quality!</li>
    <li> My estimated delivery date was in mid April and I received it today, 3/23! I got light brown and it is absolutely beautiful. This is my first wig purchase and I bought it for the price, just to see if I could pull off wearing a wig. I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
