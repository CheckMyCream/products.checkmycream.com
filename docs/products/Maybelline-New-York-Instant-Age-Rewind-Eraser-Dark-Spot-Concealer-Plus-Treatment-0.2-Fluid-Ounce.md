      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars as it wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s probably the best of the half dozen products like this that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is wonderful - not cakey, and lasts a good long time.</li>

      <li>but I finally got a shade that was perfect for under eye circles.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the long term erasing feature as I just started using it, but as a concealer, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
      <li>It does a perfect job of covering the dark circles under my eyes without going into the creases.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light weight</li>
      <li>I like the way it covers and blends easily, but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>

      <li>I bought it long time ago, because i love this product, only problem was that it came empty!!.</li>
      <li>i thought it would be an easy tube to twist up and apply, but it was so hard to just get it to click</li>
      <li>I had to try a few colors before I found the right one</li>

<li> Getting the liquid started in the sponge applicator can be a little frustrating because it takes several (or more) clicks, but hang in there.</li>
<li> gets rid of blotching, blemishes, and works especially well for dark circles under the eyes.</li>
<li> The formula is a little too shear, this prevents creasing but also means less coverage.</li>
<li> Either the Eraser ist empty or broken.</li>

    <li> This stuff is wonderful - not cakey, and lasts a good long time.</li>
    <li> Nothing comes out! Either the Eraser ist empty or broken.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Blends nicely and has good coverage.</li>
    <li> I bought it long time ago, because i love this product, only problem was that it came empty!!. Yes. As the product wasn&#x27;t coming out I decided to open it yesterday and found no product at all. So disapointed.....</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how well this product covered and for a very reasonable price.  I couldn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars as it wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s probably the best of the half dozen products like this that I&#x27;ve tried.  It also blended well with my skin tone and then by powdering over, the mark was almost invisible.  I can&#x27;t speak to the long term erasing feature as I just started using it, but as a concealer, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> perfect for covering up two scars I need to keep covered.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product religiously... gets rid of blotching, blemishes, and works especially well for dark circles under the eyes. A very good concealer...</li>
    <li> Love this product! Getting the liquid started in the sponge applicator can be a little frustrating because it takes several (or more) clicks, but hang in there. It will get started! I like the way it covers and blends easily, but it&#x27;s not heavy. Can be used throughout the day for touch-up.</li>
    <li> I love this, it cover my under eye circles great and it&#x27;s light weight</li>
    <li> i made a tiny mistake in buying this..i thought it would be an easy tube to twist up and apply, but it was so hard to just get it to click and like nothing would come out of it.  had to practically poke it into my fingers but i gave up on it cuz i didnt want to do any damage.  i would not buy this again, but i MIGHT buy a Maybelline age rewind concealer product if it were in a much easier to use package.  thanks anyway</li>
    <li> The formula is a little too shear, this prevents creasing but also means less coverage.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is a drugstore brand concealer! I&#x27;ve tried high-end concealers that cake and look powdery under the eyes. Not this one. I had to try a few colors before I found the right one but I finally got a shade that was perfect for under eye circles.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It does a perfect job of covering the dark circles under my eyes without going into the creases.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and love the coverage.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but the sponge started crumbling halfway through the tube. I just used a normal sponge then.</li>
    <li> this has been yellow tint to this which is absolutely perfect if u suffer from redness on the cheeks or face i love this product its my favorite</li>
    <li> best concealer ever!  provides antioxidants while covering!  who could ask for more???</li>
