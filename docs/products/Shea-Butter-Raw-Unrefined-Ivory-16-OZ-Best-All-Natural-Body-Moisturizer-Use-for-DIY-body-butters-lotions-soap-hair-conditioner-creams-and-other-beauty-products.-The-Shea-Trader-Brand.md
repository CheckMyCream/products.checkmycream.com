<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best Brand! Works great, won&#x27;t use another - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> Although the packaging came with a broken lid, the product itself is well made, works very well and offers long lasting softness. Little goes a long way so make sure to use the least or else it looks like oily skin.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Good product.</li>
    <li> very good skin product!!</li>
    <li> love shea butter and I buy it a lot, each batch I buy has a different smell but still works the same. Mix a scent in with it if you want a sweeter scent</li>
    <li> This shea butter is really good. The smell is not too intense however I don&#x27;t care for it. When heated it makes for a great conditioner for the hair. This product can be used for recipes to make other products. It is also good for bug bites and skin allergies. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My skin feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> My friend is a nurse and has very raw skin she is hooked on this.</li>
    <li> UPSET!!!! The shea butter arrived me broken</li>
    <li> Lovely product and, best of all, no stinky odor like other Shea butters I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Love the consistency.</li>
    <li> I have used shebutter for YEARS and I always like trying new ones, this has forever earned a spot in my bathroom. It absorbs quickly, has long lasting moisture and it just works. the only thing I wish was different was the size of the bottle.it&#x27;s a little big for my counter, but that&#x27;s probably just a personal preference. Other than that, I adore this little tub of awesome. Oh also. TIP: it works wonders on my legs after I shave!</li>
    <li> So wonderful. Creamy and Perfect for my dry skin !</li>
    <li> Husband is a diabetic shea butter is really helping with the dry skin thank you this is a great product Elaine</li>
    <li> Lovely shea butter. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Worked very well with my lotion recipes and was very easy to measure and blend in. Very nice that it had not much of its own scent so that it didn&#x27;t distract from my essential oils. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great quality. The fact that I only use very little at a time, this tub will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Wife uses every day and loves it.  She will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. One of the few products I can use on my daughter with eczema that does not burn her skin. Will purchase from the seller again.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands and torso...  its really helping my skin to tighten back up and look much better</li>
    <li> I love using shea butter and have been using shea butter for years on my skin and hair, it leaves skin smooth and remove dark spot, also leaves hair soft. Shea butter is the best moisturizer on the market for an all around use</li>
    <li> It is good for summer weather.&lt;br /&gt;I think this shea butter protect me from sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my skin everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this shea butter. Goes on really smoothly. I use it for hands and feet (heels in particular) and for legs after shaving. Takes a little while to sink in, but that is normal. Ever noticed how you can touch paper after rubbing shea butter on your hands and you don&#x27;t leave greasy finger prints? Try it :-)</li>
    <li> Great consistency and amazing price for pure shea butter. As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s not as hard as other pure shea butters that I&#x27;ve used in the past which is great because you can apply it straight to the skin. Will be using this for homemade body cream, deodorant and spot application to extra skin.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It just takes a bit too much prep to use it (warming it).  But it is still a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It works once you get it warmed up and mix it with some coconut oil. But it has a not so pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> came with safety seal stuck to the bottom of jar , dried out and lid cracked...very disappointed</li>
    <li> So smooth definitely 100% pure and natural.</li>
    <li> This is so buttery soft and feels amazing just dipping in and rubbing it on your skin! There&#x27;s no bad odor at all. I love this Shea butter and will use to make body butters and lip balms. Very high quality!</li>
    <li> The value of shea butter is pretty well known. No problems with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea butter for making soaps, lotions, lotion bars as well as many other bath and body products. This Shea butter is right up to par with the high quality Shea I have used in the past and in a convenient smaller size than the Shea I get in huge tubes. I used it straight out of the box on a sunburn I had recently received the same day. It felt/smelled as expected and I plan on using it for our family batches of bath products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE shea butter.  You can use it in just about anything for any purpose.  I mix it with different essential oils to create everything from lotion to sunscreen to face creams.  This is a great quality butter and is very smooth and easy to transition into anything you please.  I like that it&#x27;s smooth and the smell is subtle.  I will be ordering again because it&#x27;s a great deal for the size!</li>
    <li> GooooooD~Very good :)</li>
    <li> Great product for using in all my moisturizing recipes!</li>
    <li> I would give it 10 stars if I could. It arrived exactly as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is wonderful!  Very creamy and doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell to it!  Also, there were no black specks or debris in the cream. Exactly as described!  Great product, would recommend for those who are making their own beauty and skin products too.  I made shaving cream with this and it turned out awesome!</li>
    <li> I prepared it and used it in some of my body lotion and my skin has felt significantly softer! I applied it after I shaved and showered &amp; i didnt get any razor irritation because my skin was so soft!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent but works great on cracked heels/feet.</li>
    <li> I love that is is 100 percent organic. My son has eczema and this stuff really works for him.</li>
    <li> Amazing shea butter! This is the real-deal here. I use this on my hands &amp; chest (for mid-breast crease upon waking) and it moisturizes my skin so well, it looks like somebody else&#x27;s! The moisture lasts all day. No fragrance so no need to worry about allergic reactions. The texture is wonderful; I warm it a bit in my fingertips before applying &amp; it feels delightful! Seller is prompt &amp; courteous!</li>
    <li> I just received this the other day. I have not &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; it yet. I have only put a little between my hands and rubbed it into my arms. Smell is not so nice. I will definitely have to mix it with something else to create a lotion or lotion-soap and add a few essential oils, otherwise it would be way too greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  A tiny dab makes my feet, elbows, etc super soft. This will surely  last a long time.  I also plan to use it for mixing with essential oils. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own body butter. This is a very good shea butter.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies, and I&#x27;m okay with this in that respect.  I keep it in the shower, so the heat from it softens the butter.  I mostly use a combo of pure jojoba and coconut oils, but this is nice for really rough areas like knees, elbows, feet, and stretch marks.  The smell takes some getting used to.  It does have a kind of smoky/burnt smell, but it is subtle.  I haven&#x27;t tried to make soap or anything out of it.  That would probably require emulsifiers and preservatives, which is where I tend to get into trouble, allergy wise.  I&#x27;ll probably just use it as is.</li>
    <li> amazing stuff, we use this to make lip balms, body scrubs and put straight on after showers</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Made homemade lotion out of it and it&#x27;s super moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Great and generous size.This Shea Butter goes on and sinks in love the feel of my skin after applying. Highly recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> This is a huge jar of shea butter. Its rich and creamy and shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> Although rich, but it&#x27;s moist. Think I have is useful in winter.</li>
    <li> My new found love. This has so taken the place of coconut oil. I still use coconut oil for cooking but this does so much more for skin hair and everything else. using it as face moisturizer, my face has never been softer and lines are disappearing. Shea butter has amazing healing properties. Read this and you&#x27;ll start buying this by the gallons. http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/best-benefits-of-shea-butter-for-skin-hair-and-health/</li>
    <li> This Shea butter by The Commodity trader is awesome! It is perfect to use as a base for soaps, lotions, bath melts and so much more! I love that it is truley unrefined, pure and contains no GMOS which is super important to me!  I love the tin it comes in which is perfect for someone who does not work in large quantities or for personal use. It has a tight resealable lid that keeps the butter fresh! The butter itself is creamy and has that great smokey, nutty shea butter smell! It feels great on the skin and is perfect for mixing with essential oils&#x27; bout I absolutely love this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter! This stuff is a little thick, but it is not at all chunky or hard. I would say that it is the consistency of pudding with added flour, if that makes sense. My son loves the feel of it. I have to make sure I screw the lid on tightly so that he doesn&#x27;t get into it (he&#x27;s 3). I use this to make my own natural deodorant (Yes, it DOES work). It makes the deodorant a lot smoother and makes my skin really soft. I have tried it in my hair, but I think that it is really too oily for that unless you have REALLY dry hair. But it does work well on really dry feet, too. I also put it on my husband&#x27;s hands (he works with cardboard all day), and it really helped his hands not crack. This jar is also a nice amount because a little bit goes a LONG way, so I shouldn&#x27;t need more for a while.</li>
    <li> Wife love this product. She applies a small amount to her hands  by letting the heat of her hands melt it a little. She uses it on her legs and arms and she swears it leaves her skin feeling great .</li>
    <li> The smell is HORRENDOUS!!</li>
    <li> Really like this shea butter.  Keeps my skin very soft and moisturized.  Large bottle - great value.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel....  I added a bit of lavender oil and it just makes it even better...</li>
    <li> Really good product &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great to add to lotion or oils. Very moisturizing.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product for your entire body. soaks in and makes your skin so soft. Easy to add essential oils to create your own fragrance.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is fantastic! IBest way to warm, is to place it in either a bowl of warm water or stick it in the sink with warm water running so it melts a little, and the texture is amazing on the skin. It is 100% pure, absorbs great into the skin, a little greasy at first but what I do is apply before bed, put my jammys on, and let the magic happen while I sleep! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it all over your body in the morning, sometimes I add a little to my elbows and knees, but at night all over is the best! I even put some on dry areas of my face. Great product will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So luxurious! Great for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is wonderful!  My skin is super soft.  Once you warm it up a bit it is easier to get out of the jar.  Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> I really like the way this Shea butter makes my skin feel, however, it&#x27;s hard to get past the smell. It has a very natural smell which is nice because it&#x27;s not full of chemicals, but the smell is strong. I would use this lotion every day, all day if it had a more pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;Great lotion, but would love some essential oil adds to give it a clean smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Smooth and creamy, and great for a lot of different uses. I put in in chapstick and heel balm, and it melts nicely.</li>
    <li> So good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger skin</li>
    <li> Great shea butter. Smells exactly right. Seems pure. Using it in my natural beauty products&#x27; recipes.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews about unrefined shea butter &amp; pretty much stayed confused until I came across this item. What impressed me was the last line in the description area - &amp;#34;This is the highest quality shea butter we could find&amp;#34;. Item is as described. No black stuff in the butter, it didn&#x27;t smell rancid. I was very pleased with the product. For those new to unrefined shea butter, it does have a slightly nutty/smoky smell to it, not at all unpleasant, just a bit different.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very pure. I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> I received a discount on this item to review it. I really like this she&#x27;s butter. It is smooth and moisturizes my skin well. I use it on my children and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is great for the skin a must try. I like to make whipped body butter with it. great product.</li>
    <li> Do you have dry skin?  Order this product and you will never have to worry about that again.</li>
    <li> Very very good  good!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has really bad eczema and I usually use a bit of shea butter mixed with other things to form a salve of sorts to treat it. I actually can use this one straight out of the jar. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it least you can tell that it is real and pure. This brand is great.</li>
    <li> I am new to Shea Butter but I love the product! It is wonderful on my dry skin and is not to smelly. The size of the jar (16 oz) will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Amazing! so fresh butter!&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair and face smoother.&lt;br /&gt;and very absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;awesome. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I used this to make fantastic soap</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this product. A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a huge tub, 1 pound to be exact, of shea butter. I am so excited to be able to use this! I tested this out on my hand and it is very smooth and kind of waxy feeling. I am thinking that I will be going to be making a body butter.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this right here took care of my dry legs without using much at all. The best part though is that even after showering my legs are not anywhere near as dry as they normally would be...just after one application! now I only put it on my legs to try it out because I actually got this for my son who has mild eczema and plan on making him a cream with this. But to be honest I don&#x27;t think I need to add anything for him to use and I&#x27;ll be using myself. One note though is that it does have a glossy feel to it, it&#x27;s not greasy I don&#x27;t think but can&#x27;t think of the right word so glossy it is but definitely not something to worry about. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and as advertised I can&#x27;t wait to try making my own body butter</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this product.  My granddaughter suffers from severe eczema and this provides some relief and seems to assist with minimizing the flare-ups.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Product came in jar with right color and fragrance.  I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Although the product seems ok, I have to add my gripe about the packaging. The lid to the jar was broken when it arrived. Poor quality control.</li>
    <li> Love  it  so  far!  Good  for  so  many  uses</li>
    <li> Too good for skin and really work for me..</li>
    <li> This is the best ever!  I recommend</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter and the packaging. I am sold on this brand because they package it well, the butter melts smoothly on my hands and it smells nice fresh and nutty.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! I make homemade beauty products and this might be the best shea butter I have used for them! Makes my skin so soft and has so many uses! At this amazing of a price, you&#x27;d be crazy not to buy this right now!</li>
