<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have eyelash extensions, so the oil free version is great for me.  It removes all of the eye makeup, while leaving my lashes lush:)</li>
    <li> Burns my eyes, will not be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> Best product around for removing eye makeup. Zips it right off too. Leaves no offensive odor. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These work fairly well, they don&#x27;t get mascara off very easily likely need a little more moisture &amp; pads a bit thicker, but for the $ they are really nice &amp; easy. I think with a thicker pad &amp;more product they would be perfect.</li>
    <li> This is always rated great. I&#x27;ve been using for years. I love that it&#x27;s not oily. When I travel I pack them in a little snack bag, no spilling in my luggage. Great product.</li>
    <li> Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads are the only makeup remover products that I ever use! I wear waterproof mascara every day, as well as eye liner, eye shadow and eye brow highlighter. These pads remove 95% of my makeup at night. In the morning, I use another pad to wipe away what little mascara that remains. These pads are very easy to use and never leave a greasy residue in or around my eyes. I suggest buying them in the large containers of 120. Often I can find them at a \\&quot;buy one get the second one at half price\\&quot; deal at some of the major drug stores like Walgreens and CVS.    My daughter is a competitive dancer. Her dance team needs to wear a lot of stage makeup while competing. The girls usually use Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads to remove their stage makeup before we leave the arena. While it may take 4 or 5 pads to remove all of the makeup, it still leaves the girls looking clean and normal when they leave.</li>
    <li> item came as described and timely.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and does not leave the oily film on your eyes when done &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I definitely will NOT purchase again. There are better brands available. It takes numerous pads to remove eye liner and mascara.</li>
    <li> Has a very strong odor</li>
    <li> Wish these weren&#x27;t so dry but they work okay.</li>
    <li> I really like these--and I have tried many others.  What impresses me most is that I don&#x27;t have to deal with that oily residue that most other makeup remover pads leave behind.  I find it harder to remove the oily residue and if you don&#x27;t get it all off, it can adversely affect your makeup the next day--mascara and eyeliner runs and smudges, etc.  I guess I haven&#x27;t had the problems other people are finding with waterproof mascara, etc.  I find that it does remove that.  I just leave the pads on my lashes a little longer, soak them well, etc., before I start wiping off the mascara.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> These work really well removing eye makeup.  They don&#x27;t leave your eyes feeling greasy, but they do feel moisturized afterwards.  I used to use baby oil to remove my eye makeup,  I&#x27;m happy I purchased these.</li>
    <li> My wife like Lancome but it is pretty expensive.  She ordered these because they are very inexpensive (80 pack - should last 80 days, right?) but she has to use three or four to get all of her eye makeup off.  They work, it just takes awhile and a few pads.  Not bad for traveling if you don&#x27;t want to worry about carry a liquid.  My wife does not use waterproof makeup, so I don&#x27;t know how that would work, but these work for regular mascara, urban decay liner, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Seems drier than when I first started using these. Have to work pretty hard to remove mascara, which defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Works good but I always need two just for my eye makeup so it doesn&#x27;t last long for the price.  I&#x27;ve had better, but I&#x27;ll need to find the kind I ordered previously and get that again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most makeup removers, so I decided to tried this one since it was supposed to be oil free. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month. It removes most of the makeup (not all, though) and it&#x27;s still a bit oily, but not enough to trigger my allergies. OK for the price.</li>
    <li> These work great, but they are a little small</li>
    <li> These are awesome little makeup remover pads. Granted, the more eye makeup you have on the more pads you will have to use. They left my eyes feeling so soft and hydrated yet NOT oily. LOve, love, these pads! Best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Did not work well.  Have to use multiple to remove mascara from one eye.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a contact wearer with sensitive skin. No problems with this product. Works great for me. There is no irritation around my eyes &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy, nor is it drying to my skin. I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best; it&#x27;s the only eye-makeup remover that I use and I order it in bulk. Not at all greasy and great for sensitive skin or people who wear contact lenses (never irritates them). Buy it-- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought these make up remover pads for my teenage daughter.  They are a good price as a subscribe and save item.  They remove make-up well and do not irritate her skin.  I love the convenience of getting them in the mail.  I don&#x27;t have to remember to pick them up at the store.  Besides, the price would be double in the store!</li>
    <li> These pads are terrible. First there are tiny, so you need to use several to be able to clean on eye, and they DO NOT take make up let alone mascara out.  Do not waste your money with these. Really bad item.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years, however, this container was completely dried-out and therefore, a complete waste of my money.  I was very disappointed and will never buy these from amazon again.  From now on, I&#x27;ll  just buy them locally from the neighborhood stores.</li>
    <li> You will need several pads to remove your waterproof mascara</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover.  At the end of the long day, I rarely feel like taking off my makeup.  I know it&#x27;s very important, and it&#x27;s a particularly bad idea to sleep with eye makeup on- but I tend to be lazy.  These have been a lifesaver.  Ever since I found them, I don&#x27;t wake up with raccoon eyes and bad skin.  They are incredibly convenient and do a fantastic job of removing eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many makeup remover wipes are either too damp or too dry-- these are just right.  They don&#x27;t leave any residue, and don&#x27;t cause old mascara and eyeliner to drip into my eyes. The wipes are very gentle, and work great on my sensitive skin.  If it&#x27;s a day when I don&#x27;t have much makeup on, I can get away with using one pad for both eyes- saving me some money.  It&#x27;s best to look out for deals -- I can get a two pack at BJs for about 7.99 - but they&#x27;re not always available.  I found a fantastic deal and scored two for $3 on Amazon -- but I think that was a fluke. Anything for $4 a bottle should definitely be worth the value!</li>
    <li> Effective and safe makeup remover</li>
    <li> These pad are very small, so I ended up using more that one per eye at night and went through them quicker.  But I continue to use them because the don&#x27;t irritate my eyes, even when I go a little too far getting the eyeliner off.  Worth the money, and you can use both sides.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice smelling and works well to remove eye makeup especially.</li>
    <li> The person that uses this item \\&quot;Almay Oil-free Eye Makeup Remover Pads, 80 Pads\\&quot; says that it works quit well and without a lot of mess.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews but thought I would try this even though the reviews are mixed. The pads are small. I don&#x27;t wear waterproof or heavy eye makeup and can typically remove my eye makeup with only one pad. The are a bit dry and I tried turning the bottle upside down as one review suggested, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference. I find that it can also burn my eyes. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Takes the makeup off quickly. Despite being oil-free, it does leave a slight greasy feel around the eye for some reason. Otherwise works very well.</li>
    <li> This does not remove eye make up at all.  I tried with 5 pads..........nothing.  It&#x27;s absolutly useless, I threw the entire jar away.</li>
    <li> The round towletts are way to small and the solution brought tears to my eye it was to strong</li>
    <li> Shipped right on time-- but the eye makeup remover pads are dried out-- like they sat on the shelf for to long.</li>
    <li> The great thing about these pads is that they are in a convenient little package (I really like the mini travel size that is also sold).  Unfortunately, my eyes burn horribly and water to the point that I can&#x27;t open my eyes for at least a minute after using this product.  I won&#x27;t be buying them again, which is too bad because the size and packaging are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is some of the most pointless money I&#x27;ve ever spent. I scrubbed and wiped and blotted, and it took 5 of these tiny pads to get what I thought was all my waterproof mascara and eyeliner off. After I washed my face the next morning, I was Ms. Raccoon Eyes again. I recommend Neutrogena eye-makeup remover pads instead.</li>
    <li> These little oil free pads work very well to remove make up. They&#x27;re also handy for travel I just put some in a plastic bag. They don&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like some eye makeup removers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million others and I keep coming back to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the other ones are too oily, burn my eyes, make my eyes blurry, or don&#x27;t remove makeup.  These do none of those things.  They also have a sensitive skin version which I also like.  I think these get off all the makeup very well, and I use waterproof, all-day wear mascara, which can be harder to remove than other makeup.  These do a nice job.</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the best eye make up remover pads... From high end, organic, bargain brand... These do the job and do not leave pain or oily residue.</li>
    <li> I know that I do infact have sensitive skin but this product must have been oil based because after applying it left an oily residue and it burned.</li>
    <li> Works well great price</li>
    <li> These take off ALL the makeup. And there&#x27;s no irritation. Good deal too. Only complaint is I feel a tad oily after using.</li>
    <li> I really like these little things! takes off Lip gloss too, also eye shadow, Got these from My Mom, She likes them too.  Do u like these a lot? try them today there great to have! :)&amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I love these !  I buy them at the drug store and usually buy several at a time.  As others have said, sometimes when I open one, the top pads are a little dry.  If that happens all you have to do is turn the container upside down so that the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; will drain back down to the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; pads.  The ones that I have stored unopened, I will typically turn them over several times before I open them.</li>
    <li> I have used the oil free Almay eye makeup remover pads for years with great results until recently.  Unfortunately, the pads I have purchased in the past six months or so do not seem nearly as effective as ones in the past.  I use the some brand of mascara I have always used so I don&#x27;t know if they have changed their formula or Almay has but something is different.  At first I thought I might just have a bad jar but my new ones aren&#x27;t working well either.</li>
    <li> I wear only basic eyeliner for casual occasions (work, weekend afternoons, etc) and these pads are great for removing at the end of the day. I really like these because they&#x27;re quick and easy - especially after a long day of work, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. I do notice some smudging when I&#x27;m removing my liquid liner (I use Sephora&#x27;s brand); when I wipe sometimes it gets smeared under my eye. Not really a big deal - just another swipe and it&#x27;s gone.  I have used this to remove mascara before and it&#x27;s done so without any issues. Granted, neither of the products (eyeliner nor mascara) are waterproof.</li>
    <li> I have been using these pads for years to remove eye makeup.  They work great.  I keep a container in the shower so the water softens the mascara.  It just comes right off with the pad.  Then I rinse my face to remove any of the chemical from my eyes, otherwise, my eyes tend to water.  I do think they are a little too expensive.</li>
    <li> LOVE these.  Great way to refresh my eyes at the end of the day when they start feeling blurry, and a great way to get moisturizer off before working out so I don&#x27;t sweat it into my eyeballs.  They&#x27;re nice and small, which is great, the little can takes up very little space in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> These are amazing and perfect for sensitive skin. I wash my face every-night before going to bed, but I am always left with eye makeup still on and around my eyes. After washing my face I use these to wipe away any mascara or eyeliner my cleanser might have missed. They work perfect for removing makeup and leave skin clean. They don&#x27;t burn and the pads are in no way abrasive, they are very light and gentle on the tender area of skin around the eyes. I love these, and will continue to buy them when I run out, I recommend them!</li>
    <li> The pads are very small and thin. If you have on a reasonable amount of eye make up, you&#x27;ll definitely use two. The chemical smell is very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads do actually remove the eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ll be switching back to Target Brand or Neutrogena after these are gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start buying these in bulk. They dont burn my eyes and one pad does both eyes. One side for my right eye and the other side for my left. No cotton balls!</li>
    <li> Removes some eye make-up, but definitely not all of it. Cotton ball and liquid remover much more effective.</li>
    <li> They work very well but their juice gets into the eyes and it hurts! I won&#x27;t be using these again.</li>
    <li> if you value your eyeballs, do not buy this product. I had bought the travel size because I was on vacation and it was the only thing available. They were way too saturated and when you use it it burned your eyes so badly. I couldn&#x27;t see and it made my eyes all red. I thought it was just me but my cousin had also tried it and it did the same thing</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  The fragrance has an astringent-like smell and is very off-putting.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The pads are very thin so it can be kind of hard to get just one. They work well though and are not greasy.</li>
    <li> SIZE/SHAPE: Small, paper-thin circles about an inch and a half in diameter. great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFICIENCY: These do a better job of remover makeup than facial makeup cloths (i.e. no vigorous rubbing needed), but ultimately they&#x27;re not as good as a liquid makeup remover. You could even put lotion on a cotton ball and it would work just as well. So there&#x27;s no need to ever subject my eyes to this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IRRITATION: The third listed ingredient is butylene glycol, which is a known skin irritant (and also, eyeball irritant). If that doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes, the citric acid will. Everyone I know who has tried these said they sting, so I&#x27;m surprised no other reviewer shares my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe these are specifically designed for the eyes. If this was repackaged as a \\&quot;face makeup remover\\&quot;, I&#x27;d give it a decent 4/5. But an EYE makeup remover that burns like crazy and leaves my vision blurry? Not going to try these again any time soon.</li>
    <li> One pad easily removes my multiple coats of mascara with pad to spare.  I have been very satisfied with these pads and that&#x27;s why I keep getting them!</li>
    <li> These Almay pads are great for sensitive skin.. can be used around the eye area (unlike some pads)..also a good price..</li>
    <li> Removes my eye makeup just like the container says.  And here is all the filler for the gabby folks at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product was not what I expectet, but it was my fault I didnt read the label. I want makeup remover pads with oil, and the product says clearly oil free.</li>
    <li> I think the oil free is good for anyone who wears very light eyemake up or is sensitive to more oily remover.  For me, with waterproof mascara and eyeliner, I prefer the regular almay pads.</li>
    <li> works great around the eyes.  (note: it&#x27;s the oil-free)  i would buy this product again.  easy to use. good product.</li>
    <li> Not only do they cause pain and torrential tears, but they also leave a weird film in my eyes, almost like looking through water.  They remove the makeup well enough, but just aren&#x27;t worth the painful-goopy eyes.</li>
    <li> These make-up removing wipes are okay if you are wearing very little makeup. I need to use two even if I am just wearing mascara. They also sting a little so next time I&#x27;m trying a different kind!</li>
    <li> They are fast, oil free, just the right size, and economical.  I have been using them for several years and I love them.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to see these available on Amazon for such a good price. These are the BEST eye makeup remover pads for travelling.</li>
    <li> this is a great eye make up remover it really takes off all the eye make up really recomend this product</li>
    <li> Good reliable product.</li>
    <li> these things are amazing</li>
    <li> As a contac lens wearer, I really like these pads for removing eye make up.  They are totally oil-free and you can use both sides of the pad without it falling apart; very thrifty!</li>
    <li> This is the worst eye makeup remove I have ever utilized.  I wear a lot of mascara and there are many good products out there that I have utilized, however I let a sales rep talk me into this product and it is horrible.  The pads didn&#x27;t seem to have much remover on them, so I had to use several and I still had mascara on my lashes that it did not remove.  Never mind how much the product burned my eyes.  Beware, if you have used other products and they work well, this is one you want to avoid.</li>
    <li> These are good for removing make up and non irritating for those of us w/sensitive skin .  I do feel guilty using disposable products, but otherwise it would be a cotton ball anyways.</li>
    <li> Normally eye makeup removers make my eye sight so blurry, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t do that and I love it!</li>
    <li> Need one for each eye.</li>
    <li> These are the best for removing make-up on the eyes.  They are not oily and leave no residue.  My eyes are really sensitive and these are great.  The product also arrived quickly without any problems.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent because is antiallergic. It is a product that the doctor recommended.  My daughter uses it without having skin problems.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday- great product. Be sure to buy the oil free one or you may not be as satisfied. I made that mistake once.</li>
    <li> Horrible!! Irritated my eyes and I needed to use 3 pads for each eye just to take off my make up!&amp; all I ware is eye liner and mascara ! + there not water proof!</li>
    <li> Almay products have never disappointed me.  In particular, I really like the oil-free eye make-up removers.  Saves my face towels!!!</li>
    <li> A little too dry to work well. I have to use about three of these pads to remove mascara. Next purchase I&#x27;ll try a different brand.</li>
    <li> These smell exactly like nail polish remover..SICK. Pads are very tiny and thin making it a real waste of money. Terrible all in all and I would never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like that this product does not leave an oily residue. It is not all that great at removing more than the lightest coating of mascara. I have tried it with three different brands of regular and one waterproof mascaras. It was successful at removing a light layer of non-waterproof mascara. Heavier makeup leaves a lot of left over makeup under the lower lash that requires additional pads and scrubbing to remove. This is not a product to remove waterproof mascara. They are useful for carry-on luggage for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12 December&lt;br /&gt;I have returned to lower my rating from 3 stars to 2. I have tried this remover with several different brands of mascara and it does not work well with any of them. I did not even try it with waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Will probably remove your eye before your waterproof eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Bought one time and loved them. Bought second time and was highly disappointed. Supposedly fragrance free but smells like nail polish remover and after 3 pads per eye did not remove waterproof mascara. thought I had a bad batch so bought at another store. Same thing. Very strong alcohol scent. Need to go back to another brand in bottle where I need to rub,but need a product that works and is less time consuming/cost effectfiive. Very sad, thought I found a great product, but now I am out 10.00 and a product that does not work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this product. It doesn&#x27;t remove the eye makeup easily, which is strange since the little thin pad is saturated with the remover. It coats your eyes with the stuff, I have to use a towel to wipe off the excess and sticks around forever.</li>
    <li> The pads remove makeup well but are very very thin and flimsy making them hard to pull out one by one.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that it works very well.  I gave it only two starts because of the smell.  It&#x27;s got a chemical smell that really turned me off - but I tried it for functionality anyway.  If the smell wasn&#x27;t so rancid - I would have given it 5 stars for effectivity.</li>
    <li> These r useless, irritating and does not remove mascara at all. The cheaper brands or simple coconut oil is so much better.</li>
    <li> This works great for removal of eye make up... if you grab a pad that has to much solution on it, it may slightly burn your eye. So make sure you squeeze out the liquid first before rubbing your make up off.</li>
    <li> It does take off my mascara and liquid eyeliner, however I still find traces of my makeup on my eyes.  All in all it&#x27;s a great product and very gentle!!!  Amazon has a killer price! They stood behind their product and gave me quick refund! I will buy from them again!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually take off my makeup. It also smells a little like nail polish remover. I don&#x27;t plan to buy them again. But it is nice that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have lotion in my eyes afterwards like some of the more effective makeup removers.</li>
    <li> Very good product. tough, durable and economical to use that I give. 100 percent recommended for the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> It took several of these to start the removal of my eye makeup and another product to finish the job.  I want a refund. Why am I stuck with a product that I can&#x27;t use?  I have enjoyed Almay products for many years and never had a problem.  What&#x27;s up?</li>
    <li> I have to use a couple of the pads for each eye. The drawback is the smell....it&#x27;s very medicinal.</li>
    <li> It burns my eyes, when I use it</li>
    <li> These work great. They stay wet the in the container. I hate it when&lt;br /&gt;they dry out! There&#x27;s 80 in the package so they last. The only time I have to use two is if I wear a bunch of eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Love these eye wipes! use them every night- way quicker &amp; easier than using liquid make up remover and way cheaper than many alternative eye makeup remover wipes!</li>
    <li> These work well for removing eye makeup.  Does not leave an oily film.</li>
    <li> I tried to use the pads to remove my waterproof mascara but the mascara didn&#x27;t budge. Pads are thin and not very moist. Going back to my almay moisterizing remover pads.</li>
    <li> Horrible product, overly prices. Dont buy this doesnt work. I have to  wipe 20 times to take off the makeup, leaves hand and face sticky and nasty!!</li>
    <li> Terrible. These pads don&#x27;t remove waterproof mascara and barely remove even my basic eyeliner and shadow. At best they succeed in making a mess of your mascara when you&#x27;re trying to take it off. I&#x27;ve had to use a washcloth and soap every time. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying more of this product, and I won&#x27;t even be finishing up with what I have: into the trash it goes.</li>
    <li> I have used other makeup removers howver I like the ease of using this product.  Would be nice if it was a little big. I would recommend to others to use.  This is the first time I have used this product.  I like convenience of shopping through Amazon on line.</li>
    <li> Easy on your eyes but the pads are very tiny.  I wont purchase again.</li>
    <li> Have been using these oil free pads for several years and they never disappoint. They always work well, do not cause my eyes to sting, and are so handy in their bottle. I am on the reorder program and cannot recommend these highly enough!</li>
    <li> honestly i didn&#x27;t read te size specifications, they are super mini ! but they works great, I love this brand.</li>
    <li> I decided to give these a try after the price on my regular Neutrogena eye makeup remover pads was too high.  The Almay pads are less than half the price, but each pad is super thin.  I don&#x27;t feel like its enough to really remove all of my eye makeup, and I don&#x27;t wear a ton.  They work, but I like the bigger thicker Neutrogena pads better.  For the price though, these pads aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> These are easy and cheaper on Amazon than at our local CVS or Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a strong alcohol like smell though but I do like them better than regular eye make-up remover and cotton balls.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for a cousin who lives in an assistent living complex.  She loves it and insists this is better than the expensive brands.  I&#x27;ll take her word for it.  I buy it everytime she runs out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take makeup off all the way, and the makeup was not even water proof! Not siked about this product, will probably try to find something that works better.</li>
    <li> Almay Oil-free Eye Makeup remover pads gets the job of taking of eyeliner and mascara well... i like that its oif-free,so far so good,</li>
    <li> Very small and you need to rub your eyes to take make-up off. Good for traveling, but I prefer something more gentle on my eyes area</li>
    <li> This works well at removing eyeliner other products don&#x27;t remove. It is gentle on my sensitive eyes.  The pads are pretty thin, but overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Do not like this item one the pads are too small, two it always burns my eyes and three I rather have a larger size pad then more of the smaller size ones will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Easy, neat and fast eye makeup removal</li>
    <li> Eye pads seem to work well .However they are very tiny.I keep them right near my bedside .I use these before I wash my face because i hate the under eye shadow look</li>
    <li> These wipes are decent but they are on the cusp of being too dry. I think that if they were more saturated with the cleansing product they would be more effective. I don&#x27;t know if that means that the ones I got are on the old side and I got a somewhat defective product, or if they are all like that. In any case, I still use them and they still work. I just have to use more wipes at a time that one usually would.</li>
    <li> I consider this the \\&quot;best\\&quot; eye makup remover pads on the market.  They are so gentle to the eye and remove the mascara so easily. A big plus is that they are Oil-Free . . . I can&#x27;t stand oil getting into my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this for a lot of years and will never change. Also, they&#x27;re not over-saturated but have just the right amount of liquid on each pad.  They never bother my eyes or make them sensitive.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Says oil free but it&#x27;s a little oily. And it&#x27;s meant for eyes but it stings bad.</li>
    <li> I love these eye makeup remover pads!  No oil on my face but makeup comes off without burning my eyes--thanks!</li>
    <li> Work well. As always the pads stick together and come out three at a time but all pads seem to do this. No fragrance. Throughly removes the make up.</li>
    <li> best eye make up remover. Soft, and non oily.</li>
    <li> Get it every month. Love it.</li>
    <li> Cleans off the mascara very well.</li>
    <li> Almay Makeup Remover Pads are LEGIT. They&#x27;re gentle, cost effective and just a great all-around product and you can&#x27;t beat that price. If you have super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything with perfumes or dyes, like me, this is your product - will always use!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of makeup on my eyes, so the remover works great and it does not burn my eyes as other makeup removers do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and never had any complaints (except for when I occasionally leave the top off and they dry out a bit).  If that happens though i just flip them over in the container and the ones from the bottom will re-hydrate the rest.  Love these.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product.  It was packaged well.  I have now purchased  these pads twice from this vendor.  My first purchase I rated 5 stars.  This time the pads are less moist so I have to give them 4 stars.  I was able to compare them to my first jar of pads and there is definitely  a difference.  The pads are usable just a little drier.  I probably will give it one more try and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Finally, makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue buying these.</li>
    <li> Too dry so you have to be aggressive and pull on the skin to really get your makeup off. Not a smooth removal process.</li>
    <li> came quickly, and i&#x27;ll be upfront that i don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with this type of product. but while they work fairly decently, i am disappointed in the surface area of the pads themselves, tiny! seems like i need two for each eye when there&#x27;s eye liner involved. not a bad product, but i&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> This product is so gently for eye makeup removal. I take a few pads and put them in a shallower travel container to make the pads easier to reach.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove waterproof mascara.  The other product made by Almay, called \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; completely removes eye makeup.  The moisturizing residue can be tissued off and/or removed with facial cleanser or soap and water.</li>
    <li> I have used Almay products all my life and am sure the eye make up remover pads are an excellent product. I unfortunately cannot really judge them because the pads I received were almost completely dried up.  There is so little moisture in them that one swipe across the eyes depletes them of moisture so you need several pads to do one eye and honestly they are so dry that it just smears the eye make up as if you were trying to remove it with a dry tissue.</li>
    <li> I really like these makeup pads as they are easy to use and are gentle.  You don&#x27;t have to tug at your skin to get your eye makeup off.  I&#x27;ve been using these and keep reordering as they are dependable.</li>
    <li> I like the format of this product - the pads are ideal for removing eye makeup and you don&#x27;t need to use cotton pads or a washcloth. But the formula of the remover makes these essentially useless. They barely take off non-waterproof mascara, never mind waterproof. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> travels easier than the bulkier towelettes. ggod price for quantity.</li>
    <li> I know there are 80 pads, but they are very very thin. For the price I don&#x27;t feel this is one of the better pad/remover products I&#x27;ve used. They are okay.</li>
    <li> This only smudges my eyeliner instead of removing it, and worst of all, it BURNS MY EYES. Good thing i got this for free, because I would never waste my money on this crap.</li>
    <li> This is a great make up remover. It gets rid of my toughest mascara with ease, but the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or the area around my eyes. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> No it was dried out as soon as I opened it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the regular ones and they worked well. Once I ran out I decided to try these oil-free ones and they work just as well! I&#x27;ll stick to these from now on. Truth be told, these makeup remover pads by Almay are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever tried so I don&#x27;t know personally how well they compare to others, but they work perfectly for me. I only wear eyeliner and concealer for my undereyes and these get the job done.</li>
    <li> I purchase these Almay Oil Free eye makeup remover pads all of the time. Thanks to Prime membership and free shipping, I get these from Amazon whenever I am out. They remove even my waterproof eyeliner and don&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used Almay eye makeup remover since the 1990&#x27;s and I have never found anything better.  It will remove ANY and EVERY kind of makeup.  I&#x27;ve actually used it to get permanent marker off of my skin too.  It&#x27;s the best ever!  I will never use any other eye makeup remove as long as Almay is making this!</li>
    <li> I need about 3 of these just for one eye.  I don&#x27;t use a ton of mascara or eyeliner either.  This also burns and I need to make sure I am near the sink to wash my eyes after each swipe of the pad.  Even after a using 3 of these for one eye and coming out of the shower, I still look like a raccoon which means this didn&#x27;t do a good job of taking off the eye make up.  Useless!</li>
    <li> I like this product because usually I just use my regular face wash and water.  Using this product before hand gets the bulk of the mess off of my eyes, so when I am exiting the shower I do not have large dark circles around my eyes.  I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re planning to wash your face afterwards.</li>
    <li> First, ignore claim that these remove waterproof makeup.  They don&#x27;t, even with repeated tries.&lt;br /&gt;Second, while removing washable makeup, these pads also removed eyelashes to the extent of making little bald spots on each eye after just a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me, waterproof mascara user from way back, ALMAY LIQUID MOISTURIZING REMOVER is the best or as good as any other product</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed by this, the pads are tiny, I understand they are for the eyes, but this is redicolous. The horrible nail polish remover smell does not help! It does remove the makeup, but if you have sensitive eyes I do NOT recommend these. I tried them at 3 different times, rest of the box ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> Works great! Oil free works best for me.  The oil from oil based eye makeup removers seems to make my eyes blurry for awhile.</li>
    <li> Almay Oil-free Eye Makeup Remover Pads, 80 Pads.  I got this product in great time.  I love this product as well.  Not greasy at all.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It arrived in a strange yellow-ish container that looked slightly different from how it should have, which was suspicious but I decided to open it anyway. The pads smelled like rubbing alcohol (not how these pads normally smell) and I was afraid to put them near my eyes. Usually I love this product, but when I purchased it from this seller I received a terrible product. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> These little pads (emphasis on little) are not worth the money.  They are about the size of a half-dollar and you have to use several at one time on each eye.  Why using 1 wipe it rolls up in a tight and becomes totally unusable.  I am using about 4 for each eye just to get rid of thestuff.</li>
    <li> I love it for cleaning mascara off under my eyes.  However u can probably get a cheaper and larger quantity from Walmart</li>
    <li> Smallest jar of makeup remover pads I&#x27;ve ever seen. 1 pad barely removed my eye makeup. Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I love these! Very easy to use and gentle for my very allergic eyes. This shiopment came very quickly and loved the discount too.</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on another person&#x27;s suggestion. I loved the idea of the pre-moistened pads, and moreso the price. Sadly, it made my eyes dry and itchy. It&#x27;s not worthwhile to return so I&#x27;ll just give them to someone else who hopefully isn&#x27;t as sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad but true, I gotta&#x27; stick with Lancome Bifacil. It works like a charm and is so gentle. It&#x27;s just so stinking expensive. But if I want to wear eyemakeup, &amp;#34;them&#x27;s the brakes&amp;#34; for me, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It removes makeup very easily and quickly. Only need to use 1 pad for all your makeup, smell isn&#x27;t too strong. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now. I like this product because it is easy to use and not messy at all. Some of the make-up products I use are difficult to remove but other times, I have no problem at all. This product is worth the price and very convenient. Would purchase  this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a package of moisturizing eye remover pads instead....very greasy! i use them at night, and have to wipe off the extra oil before i can go to bed...not such a problem by the time i wake up in the morning...just not what i ordered.</li>
    <li> used these for years. Not too harsh, not too oily. Works great,even pulls the mascara and glue from my falsies. One pad does both eyes. A great buy</li>
    <li> Eye doctor recommended these, as oil free eye makeup remover is best. Oil sometimes can cause eye infections.</li>
    <li> I think it is little bit dry to remove mascara and other eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that it is more difficult to remove makeup than I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;However, it still works anyway....</li>
    <li> Perfect solution to getting your water proof makeup off!  I like to use face wash pads..but they are never good for eyes (as they sting) so this works great!</li>
    <li> These are quick &amp; easy to use. They are so convenient to use. No muss. No fuss. I love them.</li>
    <li> Oily..way to oily.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> These are the best eye makeup remover out there.  Convenient and leaves your eye area clean, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Good price on amazon, easy use, gets the job done while gentle on eyelids</li>
    <li> I have used these pads for years and love them for their ease in travel- no liquids to mess with.  They dissolve the make up quickly and are a fast clean up!</li>
    <li> It took everything off my face and it didnt leave my face wet and sticky.............. Thumbs Up! it did wonders</li>
    <li> The pads are extremely small and the formula burns my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using these eye makeup remover pads for more than a decade now and have yet to find anything remotely as good.  They aren&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin or eyes and they do an excellent job of removing mascara, eyeliner, and shadow.  I use these every day and don&#x27;t plan to stop, I hope they will keep making them forever!!</li>
    <li> The BEST - does not Burn, Irritate, strip eyelid - Excellent on ALL counts - ONLY buy oil-free for best and gentle results - for allergy sufferers.</li>
    <li> This is my daily makeup remover - it works well for lazy people like me. You can wipe off your eye makeup and it only takes a few seconds.  Sometimes I add a little extra liquid makeup remover to make it more moist.</li>
    <li> Works amazing at removing waterproof mascara. I&#x27;m a Makeup Artist and I use them everyday... would not pack my kit without it!</li>
    <li> Did a terrible job removing eye makeup. I had to use a ton of pads for each eye and even then they barely worked. I ended up buying the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes which work much better.</li>
    <li> These pads are great for getting my mascara and eye shadow off at night. They are also very gentle and do not bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product it does NOT work! You end up with black smudges under your eyes that won&#x27;t come off without out using some kind of cream.</li>
    <li> Okay, if I&#x27;m being honest the only reason I purchased this item was to bump up my purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. Surprisingly I think these eye makeup remover pads are terrific since I&#x27;m close to running out I&#x27;ll be placing another order.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite eye makeup remover.  the pads work very well for removing eyeliner and mascara (even waterproof).  Non oily, so i can apply new makeup right after using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil free makeup removing pads and really like them, and figured I&#x27;d try these...i wish I hadn&#x27;t! I hated how oily they were, I felt like I was smearing my makeup around. Sometimes I don&#x27;t get all my makeup off in the shower when I shower at night, and using these means washing my face, again. I&#x27;m switching back to oil free!</li>
    <li> 1 expected more . pads are way too small(my fault for not checking the specs) and several are needed to remove even light makeup, will pass on these thank you</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with the product......She will buy it again</li>
    <li> I suppose this item would work if you have incredibly tiny eyes and never use more than one coat of mascara.  It does remove eye makeup and does not burn but the pads are even smaller than cotton cosmetic pads and INCREDIBLY THIN.  You can almost see through them.  When I saw the tiny jar that holds 80 pads I knew that I had made a mistake.  Lesson learned.  My search continues.</li>
