      <li>Taste good.</li>
      <li>All good things in moderation, eh?</li>

      <li>As much as I try to quit smoking, nicotine still has the best of me.</li>

      <li>I am in sales and want to make sure my breath is good all day.</li>
      <li>This is &amp;#34;by&amp;#34; far  the best way to &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; these that I have found.</li>
      <li>I love to have them in my car, purse, work, everywhere within reach.  </li>

      <li>This stuff is great after coffee or othewise if you just want a brief, fresh taste.  </li>
      <li>The original and fresh burst are my favorites.</li>
      <li>Such as easy way to a quick breath pick me up!!</li>
      <li>Another good thing is that these strips (I am partial to the Fresh Burst flavor) don&#x27;t rot out your teeth like sugar-laden mints or gums.</li>

      <li>This is important when you have sensitive teeth like I do.</li>
      <li>; should be used sensibly and in reasonable moderation.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Gives burst of strong mint essence  and removes bad breath in minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for people who will not be able to take strong mint essence.</li>
      <li>If you use/like the mouthwash (which I hope you do), you&#x27;ll love these little boosts to get you through the day.</li>
      <li>As far as I know, these strips have no adverse effect on one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
      <li>Overuse can result in the killing off of so many natural bacteria in the mouth that their absence might allow occurrence of thrush - an overabundance of a fungus also natural to the mouth but kept in check by those beneficial bacteria you just killed off.  </li>
      <li>Also, these strips are small and easily put in a purse or pocket.  </li>
      <li>They can be intense if you&#x27;re not used to the mouthwash, but they work, and this little bundle is a great deal for a little less than the price for two at the supermarket, especially if you Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
      <li>As much as I try to cut down on coffee, I still drink eight cups a day--large cups.</li>

    <li> As much as I try to quit smoking, nicotine still has the best of me. As much as I try to cut down on coffee, I still drink eight cups a day--large cups. Neither the nicotine nor the caffeine leave a very nice scent on my breath. The Listerine PocketPaks Breath Strips are the perfect portable antidote, until I can quit both breath killers. Another good thing is that these strips (I am partial to the Fresh Burst flavor) don&#x27;t rot out your teeth like sugar-laden mints or gums. As far as I know, these strips have no adverse effect on one&#x27;s teeth. This is important when you have sensitive teeth like I do. In all, the Listerine PocketPaks Breath Strips can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I carry these things everywhere i go. They do as good a job as gum or mints, and are even good to get a foul taste out of your mouth.</li>
    <li> I have this on auto ship every three months.  I love to have them in my car, purse, work, everywhere within reach.  Such as easy way to a quick breath pick me up!!</li>
    <li> These are a great breath freshener for anytime! Love that I can put them in my purse or even a pocket.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has a perfect size for carrying in my pocket and it works great. I am in sales and want to make sure my breath is good all day. The original and fresh burst are my favorites. Be wary the first time you try the original as it is very strong.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love these things.  They melt on your tongue.  This is &amp;#34;by&amp;#34; far  the best way to &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; these that I have found.</li>
    <li> Taste taste taste taste taste.  Effectiveness, effectiveness, effectiveness, effectiveness, effectiveness, effectiveness.  Did I say taste?  Every flavor&#x27;s a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - CAUTION.  They&#x27;re effective for breath freshening because they&#x27;re antiseptic.  Overuse can result in the killing off of so many natural bacteria in the mouth that their absence might allow occurrence of thrush - an overabundance of a fungus also natural to the mouth but kept in check by those beneficial bacteria you just killed off.  Thrush is painful, can cause nasty swelling of the tongue, and once unchecked can only be killed via ingesting a prescription of fungicide over the period of a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, these little &amp;#34;miracle strips&amp;#34; should be used sensibly and in reasonable moderation.

    <li> This listerine pocketpacks are the best for keeping my breath fresh after lunch or smoke. Great flavor in great size!</li>
    <li> Convenient and cheaper than buying locally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. I keep re-ordering when I get low. They are not only great to freshen your breath when you&#x27;re out and about but they are great by the bedside for morning breath.</li>
    <li> Well, after having lunch at school, I always have one of these so that I won&#x27;t scare people away when I&#x27;m talking. The taste and the smell are very good (a little strong, but it should not be a problem). The price is good too. Get it so that you can regain your confidence after having meal.</li>
    <li> Really freshen my breath quickly</li>
    <li> Love these!  I don&#x27;t like chewing gum and most mints take a while to melt, these thin little sheets melts and works instantly!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Very tasty plate Listerine. Very refreshing. Taste good. After the meal - wonderful. I will still buy it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These should be a requirement for all face-to-face human interactions. If you use/like the mouthwash (which I hope you do), you&#x27;ll love these little boosts to get you through the day. I always have a pack in my pocket and a backup in my bag. They can be intense if you&#x27;re not used to the mouthwash, but they work, and this little bundle is a great deal for a little less than the price for two at the supermarket, especially if you Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great after coffee or othewise if you just want a brief, fresh taste.  Way overpriced for what you get.</li>
