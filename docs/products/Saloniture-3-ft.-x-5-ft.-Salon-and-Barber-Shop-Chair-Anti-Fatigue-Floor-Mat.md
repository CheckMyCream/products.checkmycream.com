    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mat! It gives me the cushion I need under my feet to endure hours and hours of standing while slaying weaves. Perfect! Great investment.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the floor mat. It is very comfortable.  Definitely worth paying the money. !</li>
    <li> I read a lot of comments, the one I was worried about was the end not lying flat, so when it arrive I put it out in the sun for one day. I bought for my wife, she has been a beautician for 40+ years. This has been the best she ever had, she had to get use to the extra thickness, this may have been the thing others were have trouble with and thinking it was not lying flat. She has a shop at home &amp; an work at a retirement center so I bought a second one .</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. Additionally,  the seller  delivered  timely and and intact. Would buy again</li>
    <li> We are all  Very happy! I bought 13 of them for the salon. Very thick and durable great if you are having any back pain.</li>
    <li> Extremely comfortable on my feet, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> These mats were exactly what I was looking for. I live in northern iowa where the weather changes at a drop of a hat. They haven&#x27;t curled up on me like other reviews have said. I got them out of the box and put some mildly heavy boxes on the corners to get them laid out flat. I left them like that for a few days and they were ready to go. I own a salon where I recently put in ceramic tile and these are perfect mats that have a lot of cushion. If I ever need another mat these will be the ones I chose again.</li>
    <li> Completely  satisfied with my  anti-fatigue  mat. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> It was everything I had expected and wanted. It&#x27;s comfy and came with no defects. Totally worth buying this item!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. It makes a huge difference in my salon and how I feel at the end of the day. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cushion that we use for in front of our sink for canning.  The indented part may cut off and turn around to have raw edge against cabinet. Or may just leave as it is.. We got the 7/8 thick.  Sure helps on standing when canning.  Thanks</li>
    <li> They are nice masts but a need to be slightly more firm. I am nervous that high heels are going to puncture it.  Also, them being soft makes it harder to wear heel.</li>
    <li> Great mat, thick, and great price !</li>
    <li> I expected a firmer foam.  After weeks of being on the flood the edges are still raised so my foot gets caught if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> Nice mat good on back and knees . But mat finish looks dirty . Would be 5 stars if had some sheen to it. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber and I stand on my feet 7 to 8 hours daily. I recently had orthoscopic knee surgery and returned to work 10 days after so I purchased the 7/8 anti-fatigue mat and it feels great! It&#x27;s very thick and plush and absorbs the pressure from my knees. Great product!</li>
    <li> Barbers are very pleased with these mats.  They say the mats are very comfortable and lessens the fatigue from standing all day.  Great bargain.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to the floor, always moving it to where it needs to be!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 30 days but quality seems good I&#x27;m pretty happy I would recommend ...</li>
    <li> Pleased with the level of comfort, the only reason I did not give it five stars is, it is hard to keep clean</li>
