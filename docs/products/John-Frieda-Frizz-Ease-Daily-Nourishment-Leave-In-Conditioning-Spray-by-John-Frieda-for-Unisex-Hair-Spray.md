      <li>This stuff is great for detangling my wigs, and is so light that I can use it several times in a week before I have to wash my wigs.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic-</li>
      <li>This spray is really light and doesn&#x27;t cause build up on your hair</li>
      <li>This fit the bill.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t built up in my hair and it&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>I put a braid in my hair almost every day but at night when I take it out, my hair is still smooth and shiny without braid wave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light product, so you won&#x27;t feel any sort of stickiness or residue in your hair at all after using it.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, stick straight hair</li>
      <li>best for hair, soft smooth clean all day long.</li>
      <li>I have very straight, kind of oily hair, and this stuff is light weight, and keeps my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I have fine, frizzy hair and this works very well on it!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase  of FRIZZ EASE DAILY NOURISHMENT CONDITIONING SPRAY...</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a good leave-in conditioner that would help combat my dry, frizziness and my daughters tangles.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling so healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair and a lot of conditioner weighs it down, but this doesn&#x27;t and it handles most of the frizz too!</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding a product that is great for both of us.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s become pretty porous even though I never pull the color through)</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I have to use this to be able to brush through my coarse &amp; wavy hair after showering.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years and still love it.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, coarse hair, and this spray has wonderfully incorporated into my haircare regime.</li>
      <li>Meh is pretty much all I can say about this.</li>
      <li>I love this product for my long hair.</li>
      <li>it is a beautiful white grey; but more dull looking.</li>
      <li>Instead of frizzy, dandelion hair, my hair feels softer and is sleeker and much easier to control.</li>
      <li>It absolutely changes the texture of my hair too.</li>
      <li>It works, it gets rid of the tangles, I really can&#x27;t get over</li>
      <li>It really worked.</li>
      <li>I really like this leave-in conditioner by John Frieda.</li>
      <li>matter how much conditioner I used in the shower, I would still shed tears trying to brush my hair.</li>
      <li>I am really fussy when it comes to my hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>My hair is really frizzy, so this does help a lot</li>
      <li>My daughter has very knotty hair, just like me.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered two bottles years ago and still haven&#x27;t finished them, despite the fact that I have very long hair and use the product very often--definitely worth buying!</li>
      <li>I use it on them after their hair is washed, particularly the layers on the underside, closest to the neck.  </li>
      <li>Based upon my use on those two hair types, I can say this product is not only a lifesaver but extraordinary.</li>
      <li>It leaves our hair soft and manageable, and makes the knots comb out much easier.</li>
      <li>Once my hair is dried, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I have anything in it.</li>
      <li>My hair looks better than it did a few months ago.</li>
      <li>This stuff works wonders for your hair when it is dry and full of static electricity, especially in winter with the dry air.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use them unless the other product becomes available.</li>
      <li>I live in Louisiana....</li>
      <li>It keeps it from getting dry and super frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Use it every time I shampoo because conditioner weighs my fine hair down.  </li>
      <li>It is much more manageable and if you blow dry, the hair does not feel brittle and dry.</li>
      <li>This leave in conditioner is so light it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
      <li>I like this product because it leaves the hair moist and soft.  </li>
      <li>If I use too much it can make my hair a tiny bit crispy, but brushing it again breaks it all up</li>
      <li>It is heavy on the hair and does not leave it smooth.</li>
      <li>I have found that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Tangles??  What tangles?</li>
    <li> I feel the same about the conditioner as the Frizz Ease  Intensive Deep Conditioner.  A beautiful body and fullness leaving no open holes; but no sheen.  I want sheen on my hair too.  it is a beautiful white grey; but more dull looking.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it leaves the hair moist and soft.  It is much more manageable and if you blow dry, the hair does not feel brittle and dry.</li>
    <li> AMAZON PURCHASE :  I am very pleased with my purchase  of FRIZZ EASE DAILY NOURISHMENT CONDITIONING SPRAY... I. HAVE CURLY HAIR AND IT GETS THE KINKS OUT AND MAKES MY HAIR SOFT AND MANAGEABLE. THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT..</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve tried! I have very fine, stick straight hair but it tends to get a bit frizzled. This leave in conditioner is so light it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all! It makes my hair silky soft and shiny. (and I dye my hair platinum blonde so it&#x27;s become pretty porous even though I never pull the color through)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is great if your hair is fly away after a wash. Just spray and it tames it down.</li>
    <li> Smells like ethanol, ALL the time. Feels like I&#x27;m putting ethanol on my hair all the time as well. I don&#x27;t know what they did to the formula, but avoid this product at its current state, at all costs.</li>
    <li> My hair is really frizzy, so this does help a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the dream curls because what I was using was discontinued. I&#x27;m not really happy with it, I&#x27;m hoping in time I will get the hang of using them together. I will continue to use them unless the other product becomes available.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t built up in my hair and it&#x27;s light. I have super thick, wavy, frizzy hair. But, this product helps with the frizz and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair and a lot of conditioner weighs it down, but this doesn&#x27;t and it handles most of the frizz too!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t help stop my frizzy hair at all but I gave it three stars because it smells amazing and does a great job at detangling my hair. I have long, thick hair that is hard to comb, even with conditioner, and this helps me comb my hair without ripping a bunch of knots out.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with nasty tangles in my hair ( I have thick, curly hair ) and this makes my hair-brushing days a lot easier and painless.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters, ages 7 and 8, and brushing out their hair is often a tear-filled experience.  One of the girls in particular has thick hair that can transform into a rat&#x27;s nest overnight.  I have tried so many products, but this one amazed me.  It works, it gets rid of the tangles, I really can&#x27;t get over how well it works.  I use it on them after their hair is washed, particularly the layers on the underside, closest to the neck.  I use a little to brush their hair out on days we don&#x27;t wash it and it works without laying down a greasy layer.  My girls are white and one has hair just a little finer and thinner than the other, and less prone to the insane tangles as her sister.  Based upon my use on those two hair types, I can say this product is not only a lifesaver but extraordinary. I wish I had tried it years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, but lately, have turned to Amazon to purchase because I&#x27;m having problems finding it locally.  The price is actually cheaper than what I would have spent locally.  It works on my hair - I have frizzy, curly, and thick hair.</li>
    <li> I reorder this product because it is the healthiest product I can use on my wavy hair. Some grey gets wirey but Frizz Ease makes all that go away for a week. I put a braid in my hair almost every day but at night when I take it out, my hair is still smooth and shiny without braid wave. I Love this product .I  stock up on it afraid that one day I might not be able to get it. By the way ,my hair is as this as 3 woman and past my waist. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Meh is pretty much all I can say about this. I have been looking for a good leave-in conditioner that would help combat my dry, frizziness and my daughters tangles. This isn&#x27;t it, unfortunately. The price was great but it just doesn&#x27;t help either of us. It actually makes my hair feel a bit &#x27;dirty&#x27; if I accidentally spritz too much and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for your hair when it is dry and full of static electricity, especially in winter with the dry air. This stuff does the job intended. Love it! Best stuff ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was scared to use this product.  I have naturally wavy hair and was tired of getting up just to straighten my hair every single morning, so I grew a wild hair and decided to go more natural.  I use this product on wet hair (along with the dream curls spray) let my hair air dry and I have great results.  I was scared because I used this product a few years ago and thought that it made my hair oily, but I think this mainly occurs if you use it and then straighten it.  It works perfectly if you want nice waves without the frizz!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful leave in conditioner, just keep it off your skin.  Seems to be making my face break out. Not bad on the frizzies, but not great either.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very knotty hair, just like me. And since my hair is thick and her hair is fine I have a hard time finding a product that is great for both of us. This fit the bill. It smells beautiful and works very well! It leaves our hair soft and manageable, and makes the knots comb out much easier.</li>
    <li> Could no longer find this at my local Walgreens. So happy for subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair, and this spray has wonderfully incorporated into my haircare regime. I usually spray it all over my damp hair after a shower, and then find my hair is softer and tangle-free. I can also use this on dry hair before heat styling to protect my hair from damage. It&#x27;s a light product, so you won&#x27;t feel any sort of stickiness or residue in your hair at all after using it. It also smells great, but not with an overpowering scent. I ordered two bottles years ago and still haven&#x27;t finished them, despite the fact that I have very long hair and use the product very often--definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on your hair. Leaving it better with each use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work great on wigs and tracks.</li>
    <li> We like this spray. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, but it still does its job. Seems to work with our finicky hair.</li>
    <li> i have very fine, tangly hair and have to fight to comb it out every morning.  This stuff is fantastic- gets the tangles out, leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all</li>
    <li> This does WONDERS for my frizzy hair! I love it! The &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; version is so much cheaper and exactly the same as the brand marketed toward women, which is frustratingly more expensive. I&#x27;m happy! I won&#x27;t switch unless I&#x27;m forced to!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for detangling my wigs, and is so light that I can use it several times in a week before I have to wash my wigs.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have to use this to be able to brush through my coarse &amp; wavy hair after showering. It absolutely changes the texture of my hair too. There have been a couple of times where I don&#x27;t feel like buying more so I run out, and then a couple of weeks later my hair feels dry and dead. Use it, you need it :)</li>
    <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner by John Frieda. I can&#x27;t find anything else that is just leave-in conditioner without being a mousse or gel. This spray is really light and doesn&#x27;t cause build up on your hair so it&#x27;s safe to use every day.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of very fine hair that frizzes easily, this product moisturizers without weight. I have found that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried .many hair products for my dry long dry hair with a touch of frizz I might add. Trust me I am really fussy when it comes to my hair. I first bought this at a store thinking the price was good so why not try it.  OMGOSH!! It really worked. I have paid triple for other spray in conditioner (and that&#x27;s just what they were but left my hair dry and no nourishment , notta, for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful leave in spray by John Frieda does EXACTLY what it says.!!  This is no lie , but my hairdresser can&#x27;t believe how beautiful the condition of my hair is. Yes indeed and I am not a youngster (by many many years)</li>
    <li> This product seems to help with those who suffer from hair frizziness on humid days. It is by no means a cure all for the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very thick, coarse hair that defied taming. This product actually does the trick without being too heavy or smelly. Instead of frizzy, dandelion hair, my hair feels softer and is sleeker and much easier to control. Great product.</li>
    <li> Has a not- so-fresh scent.  Didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as I&#x27;d like.  It believe it was old because the smell was as if it was stale.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s lightweight and gets rid of static.</li>
    <li> Use it every time I shampoo because conditioner weighs my fine hair down.  Use it as to de-tangle my son&#x27;s long hair.</li>
    <li> Works well on frizzy hair.  I would recommend this product to my family and friends.  Good product for those who need it.</li>
    <li> It is heavy on the hair and does not leave it smooth. Didn&#x27;t like how it left my hair feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and still love it.  I have permed hair, and this is SUPERB for detangling after shampoos and good for flyaway hair between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I orginally found it at WalMart, but they stopped carrying it, so Amazon has been my source for it for a couple of years, now.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I just love these products from John Frieda. My hair is dry and damaged and the Frizz Ease makes my hair soft and manageable. I would recommend any of the John Frieda products.</li>
    <li> Helps some with the frizz I get with a perm. My hair stays curled better with this too.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to a house that has hard water. I tried a filter, but my hair still turns into a rat&#x27;s nest in an instant. Seeing as I rent, and can&#x27;t alter the water here, I chose to use a detangler/leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much conditioner I used in the shower, I would still shed tears trying to brush my hair. I used this (without using a conditioner in the shower) and am so happy I did! Brushing is a breeze again. I have very straight, kind of oily hair, and this stuff is light weight, and keeps my hair soft. Once my hair is dried, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I have anything in it. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair that is super-prone to fly-aways and frizz.  A few squirts of this on wet hair before I brush helps manage my hair regardless of humidity levels and minimizes frizz while letting my curls remain bouncy.  Also this does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> I live in Louisiana....love the spray on conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works well with my daily regimen.  My hair looks better than it did a few months ago.</li>
    <li> best for hair, soft smooth clean all day long.</li>
    <li> Works well on dry, curly, frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> This conditioning spray has been a life saver for my thick and curly hair.  It keeps it from getting dry and super frizzy.  That is hard to find for a reasonable price.  I have had great success with the Frizz Ease line of hair products.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE, WORKS GOOD.</li>
    <li> Great leave-in conditioner for my curly hair. Can also us the next day to refresh my curls.</li>
    <li> Works well, cheaper than I can buy locally</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it is hard to find it here.  I have fine, frizzy hair and this works very well on it!</li>
    <li> I think they changed the formula for this, it now really weighs down my hair when in the past it actually acted to make my hair fuller.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my long hair. It leaves my hair feeling so healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I always use this spray, it works great but on here I can get two for slightly less than I pay for one in the store.</li>
    <li> It works!  I got sick of using the kids&#x27; Aussie spray-in conditioner as I smelled like a giant grape.  My hair is stick-straight but I let it air dry, so if not maintained it frizzes up around my head making me look a bit frazzled and insane.  Not a good look.  I started spraying Frizz-Ease on my wet hair after showering, and then brushing it through and letting it dry.  If I use too much it can make my hair a tiny bit crispy, but brushing it again breaks it all up and my hair is a lot, lot smoother now.  It smells nice but isn&#x27;t strongly perfumed, which I also like.  I will definitely keep buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning, though - if you&#x27;ve got hardwood, tile, or linoleum floors don&#x27;t use this product while standing on them.  Once it dries it turns impermeable surfaces into the Ice Capades.  I either spray it in the shower and then rinse the tub, or while standing on carpet.</li>
    <li> I love other John Frieda products, but this one I&#x27;m not sure does anything for my hair... I tried it for a week and didn&#x27;t think my hair look any better.</li>
