      <li>This one is just ok.  </li>
      <li>I came accross this while searching for another product, and since I love Argan Oil in my hair products, and the price was appealing, I tried it on a whim.</li>
      <li>I love using this body butter in conjunction with c. Booth&#x27;s Walnut Shell Body Scrub &amp; Cleanser for an extra-smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body cream.</li>
      <li>Yes, it has a fragrance, but it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>Absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
      <li>but i like the olive oil one better</li>
      <li>I will order some more.</li>
      <li>I plan to order more for the price</li>
      <li>and when I ran out I had to get some more.  </li>
      <li>As with all other c. Booth and Freeman Beauty products, it&#x27;s a great value and a great product.</li>
      <li>It softens your skin and absorbs quickly, leaving a light, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This cream smells wonderful (very light, fresh frangrance) and it does not disrupt my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The product itself is pretty darned good.</li>
      <li>The ingredients in this product are some of the best for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Applies easily and leaves skin smooth but not greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, and it keeps your skin smooth all day.</li>
      <li>Cheap garbage</li>
      <li>Whipped like texture goes on smooth and skin stays hydrated overnight.  </li>
      <li>I eventually started using fragrance free shea butter</li>
      <li>Great smell and terrific performance.  </li>
      <li>Its residue scent can be overwhelming for first two hours; therefore, apply sparingly with a light coating.</li>
      <li>I came to love the way it makes my skin feel so much that I subscribed to it!</li>
      <li>Love this Butter so much!</li>
      <li>Originally given to me as a gift.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful, It feels like a luxury, thick, smooth and</li>
      <li>Absolutely a great product, does what it says it will do to dry skin, I have seen results on my skin since using it.</li>
      <li>This Body Butter, smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling so soft</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because I have problem skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to many products.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry, and smells good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume since I prefer a clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>It has a perfume smell rather than a clean fresh smell</li>
      <li>Nice thick provides a good amount of moisture.</li>
      <li>I like this product: it is silky-smooth in texture and is absorbed fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried many unscented lotions and creams over the years.</li>
      <li>but once it completely absorbed into my skin, the scent was undetected</li>
      <li>I used this product up within a month, the smell is mild and amazing, it is silky smooth on your skin, and helps with extra dry skin, will be buying again for sure...</li>
      <li>Relieves dry skin quickly and has a nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Though I&#x27;m going to have to change my subscription so that it will arrive more frequently, because my husband tried it and he loves it every bit as much as I do!</li>
      <li>I also have chronic dry skin, bouts of stubborn psoriasis, and have allergic reactions to SOOOOO MANY THINGS!</li>
      <li>I really liked it until I found out its not natural, threw it away.</li>
      <li>It absorbs well and has good texture, however the fragrance is less than optimal.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much I donated all my other body lotions and creams to the women&#x27;s shelter.  </li>
      <li>Amazing, for the price is one of the best i only can compare it with the bodyshop but is a big diference in price if your skin is not completyyyyyy dry as mine is ok, works for me and i have complety dry skin and live in the caribbean wich makes everything more dry.</li>
      <li>Not greasy at all, leaves you soft and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Initially bought at a TJ Maxx and fell in love with the scent and texture.</li>
      <li>Good product but the smell started to irritate my senses after a few months of usage.</li>
      <li>She needs heavy moisture for her skin, but allergies keep her from being able to enjoy fragrances as her daughter does.  </li>
      <li>The argan oil formula is gentle--whether applied to new blisters on your feet or freshly-shaven legs, it never stings (unlike some other popular body butters).</li>
      <li>really does the job.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>But the smell is very cheap and generic, sweet musky floral and heavy on that metallic-green scent of galbanum.</li>
      <li>I looked everywhere when I got back home to purchase more but ending up back on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend trying this one out.</li>
      <li>Good price, a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Now I will never have to worry about being without my new Holy Grail of skin moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Kind of a deep flower smell, not overbearing, just not fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It is probably the first jar of cream that I have ever used the entire jar.  </li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t react negatively to it at all, which is a huge deal for me!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not a heavy perfume smell.  </li>

    <li> I like this product: it is silky-smooth in texture and is absorbed fairly quickly. Also, it&#x27;s reasonably priced. (I subscribe to regular shipments of this body butter)</li>
    <li> Originally given to me as a gift. Now I&#x27;m buying to give to others. Yummy stuff. Absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
    <li> This Body Butter, smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling so soft I&#x27;ve purchased other&#x27;s that cost alot more and been disappointed with them compared to this one.</li>
    <li> Wonderful transaction; super fast, super price and excellent product. So thick and full. I will buy this product and use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the compliments. :-)</li>
    <li> The price is very attractive for this cream.  It absorbs well and has good texture, however the fragrance is less than optimal.  Kind of a deep flower smell, not overbearing, just not fantastic.  Still a steal for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Relieves dry skin quickly and has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this down in Delaware last summer at a Rite Aid store.  It is probably the first jar of cream that I have ever used the entire jar.  The fragrance is subtle but the feel that your skin has after putting it is is dreamingly soft.  I use it all over, including my face.  I looked everywhere when I got back home to purchase more but ending up back on Amazon.  Great price, fast shipping and I got my wonderful cream again.  I loved it so much I donated all my other body lotions and creams to the women&#x27;s shelter.  A win win for all of us.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real nice but i like the olive oil one better</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, It feels like a luxury, thick, smooth and your skins just soaks it in. Nice fragrance as well</li>
    <li> I love this cream! Has a pleasant scent.  I use it on my hands arms and feet.  Not greasy at all, leaves you soft and comfortable.  Good price, a little goes a long way.  Their lotion in the pump bottle is also good.  Great for after shower.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin like velvet, DO NOT LEAVE THE LID OFF......it will harden, otherwise, its nirvana for the skin.</li>
    <li> I use on my elbows and feet. really does the job. it also smells real nice, i get many compliments</li>
    <li> Yes, it has a fragrance, but it&#x27;s lovely. It&#x27;s not sticky, and it keeps your skin smooth all day. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance!! I mix it with a little oil during the winter to help keep my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews before I bought this, so many reviewers said this was the best they had ever used.  I would not say that.  It&#x27;s ok far from the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am crazy for lotions.  I use creams, lotions etc faithfully.  This one is just ok.  I will not buy it again but I will finish using the jar I bought.  It has a perfume smell rather than a clean fresh smell but it&#x27;s not a heavy perfume smell.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume since I prefer a clean fresh scent.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! and its cheaper on here than ulta!</li>
    <li> This was in my opinion your average body butter.  Great price for the amount you get though and works well.  Has a nice pleasant scent while applying but once it completely absorbed into my skin, the scent was undetected so if you are looking for a lingering scent, might not be what you are  looking for.</li>
    <li> Initially bought at a TJ Maxx and fell in love with the scent and texture. Will continue to order until I can find it locally.</li>
    <li> Applies easily and leaves skin smooth but not greasy.  Its residue scent can be overwhelming for first two hours; therefore, apply sparingly with a light coating.</li>
    <li> Extremely nice soaks in no residue used on my diabetic husband feet he hates creams not this one  smells great</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the argan oil I got before, but it is good. I will order some more.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before from Ulta and when I ran out I had to get some more.  It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry, and smells good.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best body butter I have ever used. I have tried designer body butter that did not work this well. Love this product!!! Works well!!!</li>
    <li> Good product but the smell started to irritate my senses after a few months of usage. I eventually started using fragrance free shea butter</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great product, does what it says it will do to dry skin, I have seen results on my skin since using it. I plan to order more for the price it&#x27;s great, and am also going to give them as gifts.  The ingredients in this product are some of the best for dry skin.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if you have extra dry skin  for one reason or another, medications and illnesses can cause dry skin, use this product it works!!!</li>
    <li> Delicious, fragrant, super moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a gift basket for my dear Mom.  She needs heavy moisture for her skin, but allergies keep her from being able to enjoy fragrances as her daughter does.  This is one of the greatest products with all that my mom requires.  Very happy to include this in her basket, and she will love it.  The price cannot be beat.  Thank you C. Booth :-0</li>
    <li> Amazing, for the price is one of the best i only can compare it with the bodyshop but is a big diference in price if your skin is not completyyyyyy dry as mine is ok, works for me and i have complety dry skin and live in the caribbean wich makes everything more dry. just buy it.</li>
    <li> Smells like afro  sheen and jail soap. Leaves skin sticky. Cheap garbage</li>
    <li> I came accross this while searching for another product, and since I love Argan Oil in my hair products, and the price was appealing, I tried it on a whim. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because I have problem skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to many products. I also have chronic dry skin, bouts of stubborn psoriasis, and have allergic reactions to SOOOOO MANY THINGS! To my surprise, I LOVE IT! My skin doesn&#x27;t react negatively to it at all, which is a huge deal for me! On top of that it works great! It moisturizes my skin very well, and the moisture lasts a long time, yet it isn&#x27;t too heavy nor greasy in the slightest. I came to love the way it makes my skin feel so much that I subscribed to it! Now I will never have to worry about being without my new Holy Grail of skin moisturizers. Though I&#x27;m going to have to change my subscription so that it will arrive more frequently, because my husband tried it and he loves it every bit as much as I do! And that, my friends, says it all!</li>
    <li> I really liked it until I found out its not natural, threw it away.</li>
    <li> This body butter is a great product. It keep my skin moisturize all day long. It is rich and thick and goes on so silky on my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product up within a month, the smell is mild and amazing, it is silky smooth on your skin, and helps with extra dry skin, will be buying again for sure...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body cream. I have very sensitive skin and have tried many unscented lotions and creams over the years. This cream smells wonderful (very light, fresh frangrance) and it does not disrupt my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two years and see no reason to stop.</li>
    <li> Best drug store cream ever.  Whipped like texture goes on smooth and skin stays hydrated overnight.  Can even feel it on my feet the next morning after putting it on before bed.  Smells like heaven!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful body cream.  Great smell and terrific performance.  Your skin will feel great.</li>
    <li> Definitely not for winter skin. It smells pretty good, but doesn&#x27;t provide the moisture my skin needs during cold, dry months.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I use!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body butter. It softens your skin and absorbs quickly, leaving a light, pleasant scent. The argan oil formula is gentle--whether applied to new blisters on your feet or freshly-shaven legs, it never stings (unlike some other popular body butters). I love using this body butter in conjunction with c. Booth&#x27;s Walnut Shell Body Scrub &amp; Cleanser for an extra-smooth shave. I use it on my feet each day after my shower, and maybe once a week on the rest of my body if my skin is feeling particularly dry or itchy. When I run out, my feet notice and are not happy! The jar seems to last forever, too--daily application for almost four months for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this one out. As with all other c. Booth and Freeman Beauty products, it&#x27;s a great value and a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice thick provides a good amount of moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this Butter so much! The Egyptian Argan oil smells SO GOOD! Forever repurchase this products!</li>
    <li> The product itself is pretty darned good. But the smell is very cheap and generic, sweet musky floral and heavy on that metallic-green scent of galbanum. If you can handle that smell the product is really good!</li>
