    <li> The is a pretty good product, but the adhesive does not last all day.  I find that I often have to reapply during the latter part of the day especially before dinnertime.  Because I have a hard time finding this product in my area, I ordered it from Amazon.  There are 12 tubes in the lot, but the tubes are half the size of what is sold in stores.</li>
    <li> Was why better then I expected to be, will buy again</li>
