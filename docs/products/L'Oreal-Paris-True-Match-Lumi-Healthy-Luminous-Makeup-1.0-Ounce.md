### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wore this yesterday, it is awesome!</li>
      <li>/&gt;All-in-all, a really great product--would have gotten 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have the Oily Afternoon Syndrome, but that&#x27;s life!</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin.  </li>
      <li>and I am very fair.  </li>
      <li>Great color, coverage, &amp; wear.</li>
      <li>And, I&#x27;m happy to say, my skin--which is ultra-sensitive and likes to take revenge for things like resting my chin in my hands--didn&#x27;t react at all.</li>
      <li>This is amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, too, because this stuff is wonderful.</li>
      <li>The color is fair, as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job of covering up redness though, and it is easy to blend.</li>
      <li>If I liked powder, perhaps that would help.  </li>
      <li>Excellent foundation better than higher and priced merchandise at leading department stores</li>
      <li>I love how it blends and it works great to smooth my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with this foudation.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable odor (as many drugstore brands with SPF do).  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found any drugstore brands that hold up any better.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of moisturizer looking chalky like a number of drug store brands.</li>
      <li>If you prefer more coverage, then, maybe it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
      <li>It has a light to medium coverage, and you can layer to make for more coverage.</li>
      <li>The foundation blends easily and gives light coverage.  </li>
      <li>Feels really light on my face</li>
      <li>It glides onto my skin, blends beautifully, and works with my dry patches instead of against them.</li>
      <li>The color, however, is a perfect match for my super pale skin.  </li>
      <li>And true to the name, it really does give you a clean, bright face, a perfect base for whatever look you&#x27;re going for--and excellent if you&#x27;re the \\&quot;no-make-up make up\\&quot; sort, as this stuff is all but invisible when blended with a big foundation</li>
      <li>I pair it with the Magic Lumi Primer and usually use a damp beauty blender to blend it out, and it looks great.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and so far, I have no complaints!  </li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>However, if you are not looking for long wear, this is really nice.  </li>
      <li>This is actually the foundation I used for my wedding, and I got so many compliments on my makeup.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on okay without feeling gross.</li>
      <li>Exact color match to my combination skin.</li>
      <li>I ordered this foundation because it was recommended as one of the few drugstore brands that is actually fair enough to work with really light complexions.  </li>
      <li>but it when you have naturally very oily skin</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference when I use the primer</li>
      <li>It is smooth and creamy and so far hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have really dry and sensitive skin and most foundations make my skin flaky and irritated.</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t even a slight increase in breakouts after the switch and, if anything, my skin evened out more.</li>
      <li>decent product, but i was dissapointed to find out that loreal tests their products on animals.</li>
      <li>The coverage is good - not too heavy or sheer.  </li>
      <li>Good price on a very hard to find shade</li>
      <li>Amazing product other than the fact that it was a bit darker than I expected.</li>
      <li>However, I happen to have deathly pale skin (we&#x27;re talking Casper the Friendly Ghost&#x27;s level)</li>
      <li>If you are really light skin, (like usually the lightest</li>
      <li>and though I&#x27;ve been at it for a month I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in the bottle.</li>
      <li>switched to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Lumi foundation thinking I could just return it if it turned out to be truly awful, and if it did work, it was far (far, far) cheaper than Clinique, which would make my pocket book happy.</li>

<li> Great alternative to expensive department store foundations I have used in the past!</li>
<li> only is this cheaper than my former go-to foundation, but I use far less of it (only one squirt!)</li>
<li> It is a little finicky when it comes to applying it on dry skin, but it&#x27;s not one of those foundations that I feel I need to really exfoliate beforehand in order for it to work.</li>
<li> I have been looking for a liquid foundation for my horrible dry face for a long time, and this is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for people with dry skin, but I don&#x27;t know if oily-skinned individuals would like it.</li>
<li> so, sadly, it didn&#x27;t fit my skin tone.</li>
<li> The problem is that I have an unhappy combination of flaky-dry skin and deeply oily patches--Clinique&#x27;s foundation worked okay on the oily bits but was ruinous on the flaky sections, and was actually so impossible that I spent the better part of two years mixing it with my daily moisturizer just to make it workable.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it.</li>
<li> I do have dry skin</li>
<li> If you do have dry skin, be mindful of that.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t cling to dry patches, or crease, or cake, or anything that I hate with most foundation.</li>
<li> this is too dark for me.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s lightweight, not too heavy, which I like for the spring and summer season.</li>
<li> I do find that it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; after a few hours.  </li>
<li> That means I will keep buying it until something else luminous and pale comes along.</li>
<li> I have very little creasing in my skin</li>
<li> Unfortunately the porcelain was STILL too dark for my pale skin.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard using something that makes your skin shiny.</li>
<li> Too thick.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t cover thickly.</li>
<li> Really disappointing in how dark this product is.  </li>
<li> The foundation was OPENED , used and it has a BROKEN cap !</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t pay12$ to get a used AND broken bottle !</li>

    <li> decent product, but i was dissapointed to find out that loreal tests their products on animals.</li>
    <li> Exact color match to my combination skin. It is a little finicky when it comes to applying it on dry skin, but it&#x27;s not one of those foundations that I feel I need to really exfoliate beforehand in order for it to work. If you do have dry skin, be mindful of that. If you have oily skin, this definitely one you should try.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin.  I like the shade.  The foundation blends easily and gives light coverage.  That&#x27;s what I expect in makeup foundation.</li>
    <li> Amazing product other than the fact that it was a bit darker than I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent foundation better than higher and priced merchandise at leading department stores</li>
    <li> This has a luxurious feel to it. It is smooth and creamy and so far hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin. I do have dry skin and this does show the flakes if you have them. It does a great job of covering up redness though, and it is easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Too thick.  Takes a sponge to spread over your face.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of moisturizer looking chalky like a number of drug store brands. Great color, coverage, &amp; wear.</li>
    <li> I ordered this foundation because it was recommended as one of the few drugstore brands that is actually fair enough to work with really light complexions.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  The color is fair, as I had hoped.  The coverage is good - not too heavy or sheer.  It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable odor (as many drugstore brands with SPF do).  I also like the pump dispenser.  It goes on very smoothly and so far, I have no complaints!  Great alternative to expensive department store foundations I have used in the past!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation. I love how it blends and it works great to smooth my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The foundation was OPENED , used and it has a BROKEN cap !&lt;br /&gt;Seriously ! I didn&#x27;t pay12$ to get a used AND broken bottle !&lt;br /&gt;something must be done about this !!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m traveling soon so I don&#x27;t have time to return t !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing !!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a liquid foundation for my horrible dry face for a long time, and this is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used.

    <li> Wore this yesterday, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love it. Feels really light on my face</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this product and how it applies. However, I happen to have deathly pale skin (we&#x27;re talking Casper the Friendly Ghost&#x27;s level) so, sadly, it didn&#x27;t fit my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m okay with this foudation. I love it but it when you have naturally very oily skin it&#x27;s hard using something that makes your skin shiny.</li>
    <li> Good price on a very hard to find shade</li>
    <li> I have really dry and sensitive skin and most foundations make my skin flaky and irritated. This is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or irritate it. It has a light to medium coverage, and you can layer to make for more coverage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, not too heavy, which I like for the spring and summer season. If you prefer more coverage, then, maybe it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
    <li> Really disappointing in how dark this product is.  If you are really light skin, (like usually the lightest my color IQ is 1Y1) this is too dark for me.  Also in discovering that L&#x27;Oreal still does animal testing with their products I will not be exploring anymore of their products.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I am approaching 40 faster than I care to think.  I have very little creasing in my skin and I am very fair.  This goes on well.  It is luminous and is comparable to the finishes of much more expensive brands.  I do find that it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; after a few hours.  It fades from the oily patches and clumps up on the dryer parts.  However, if you are not looking for long wear, this is really nice.  I haven&#x27;t found any drugstore brands that hold up any better.  If I liked powder, perhaps that would help.  But I don&#x27;t.  I have used it with the matching Lumi concealer and primer.  I really don&#x27;t see a difference when I use the primer and when I don&#x27;t.  The color, however, is a perfect match for my super pale skin.  That means I will keep buying it until something else luminous and pale comes along.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated user of Clinique&#x27;s Acne Solutions liquid foundation for years, with the idea that \\&quot;Acne Solutions\\&quot; meant that it was the only foundation I could possibly ever use without turning into a zit-monster. The problem is that I have an unhappy combination of flaky-dry skin and deeply oily patches--Clinique&#x27;s foundation worked okay on the oily bits but was ruinous on the flaky sections, and was actually so impossible that I spent the better part of two years mixing it with my daily moisturizer just to make it workable. (Should have been a red flag, I know, I know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Lumi foundation thinking I could just return it if it turned out to be truly awful, and if it did work, it was far (far, far) cheaper than Clinique, which would make my pocket book happy. I&#x27;m glad I did, too, because this stuff is wonderful. It glides onto my skin, blends beautifully, and works with my dry patches instead of against them. I do get a bit oilier in the evenings than I did before, but that&#x27;s because this isn&#x27;t an anti-shine foundation, so finishing powder is a must, but that&#x27;s a molehill compared to the mountain that was I&#x27;m Not Shedding My Skin Like A Snake I Swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this cheaper than my former go-to foundation, but I use far less of it (only one squirt!) and though I&#x27;ve been at it for a month I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in the bottle. And, I&#x27;m happy to say, my skin--which is ultra-sensitive and likes to take revenge for things like resting my chin in my hands--didn&#x27;t react at all. There wasn&#x27;t even a slight increase in breakouts after the switch and, if anything, my skin evened out more. And true to the name, it really does give you a clean, bright face, a perfect base for whatever look you&#x27;re going for--and excellent if you&#x27;re the \\&quot;no-make-up make up\\&quot; sort, as this stuff is all but invisible when blended with a big foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a really great product--would have gotten 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have the Oily Afternoon Syndrome, but that&#x27;s life!</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on okay without feeling gross. It doesn&#x27;t cover thickly. Unfortunately the porcelain was STILL too dark for my pale skin.</li>
