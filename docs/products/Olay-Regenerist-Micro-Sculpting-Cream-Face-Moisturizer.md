<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not like that I received my cream without the box.  It makes me feel the cream is not sanitary.  I will only use it on my neck, not on my face, and I will not buy it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> My mom had used up three bottles of this. It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Probably works well, but is definitely not fragrance free. Stopped using after one week.</li>
    <li> Olay has a reputation for having excellent products this one is excellent as well.  Light not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few years now and I still really like it.  It&#x27;s as good or better than all the expensive department store creams for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with regenerist micro sculpting serum so not sure which product is to be credited. But my skin feels amazing with this combo. I use the serum twice a day AM &amp; PM. I use this cream for night on top of the serum. For day, I use the complete daily defense moisturizer w/ spf30 on top of the serum. Working great. Non greasy, dries instantly leaving smooth even skin tone. Wow.</li>
    <li> ive read a lot of great things from this moisturizer. i tried the serum version and it give my skin a pinkish glow but when i stopped using it my skin, the glow went away too. this is very good moisturizer, with a lot of good benefits for ur skin. try reading the reviews online. it&#x27;s doesnt give me oily skin i have to be careful with that because i live in a tropic country. has a lightweight feel. if you want one with spf they have it too. i just prefer this since i can use it as night time moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> But seriously folks, I&#x27;m so glad that I came across this product. I read about on line in one of Yahoo&#x27;s helpful news items. I decided to try it because I&#x27;m just as vain as the next person and am fighting old age wrinkles too. Not that you are :). I should have started at an earlier age, but it didn&#x27;t occur to me. I was having too much fun. Well, here I am in my 60&#x27;s, wake up, look in the mirror, and wonder where all those wrinkles came from. Well, I&#x27;m starting to fight back. Cosmetic surgery is out of the pocketbook range so here I am trying out this cream. I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the noticable change in a few short weeks. And any change is welcome at my age. I would have to say that that they look like about half the depth of the original wrinkles were when I started. I don&#x27;t know how much of an improvement that it will eventually give me, but I&#x27;m in it for the long haul. I have to add that the texture of my skin feels so much softer to the touch also. The fact that it is fragrance free was my deciding factor in buying it and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
    <li> I like it is very good cream</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 4 Years now and am very satisfied with it.  I was able to purchase this through Amazon at a very good price</li>
    <li> This product seems to work for my skin, no scent to overwhelm me, absorbs really well, and moisturizes my dry complexion.</li>
    <li> Consistently great moisturizer. I really appreciate the results when I run out for a few days and can see the difference it makes with fine lines.  Fragrance free is the only one I&#x27;ll use.  Unlike prior reviews it clearly has Olay on the lid and is labeled made in the USA, so I guess they resolved that issue.  My last order arrived early.</li>
    <li> Have been an Olay user for years.  Very satisfied with this product.  Be realilistic ladies.  It will not made a 60+ face look 20 years younger, but does mosturize and face feels smooth after use.  Fragrance free also.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream off and on for a couple of years.  It is a good cream for the price although I prefer the fragrance variety.</li>
    <li> After using several Olay products, I find that they work better than brands costing much more. I am a religious evening face washer and apply this product every evening. I notice that my skin is smooth and clear in the morning. I especially like the fragrance free. I am never going to stop the progression of my age. I just want to look as good as I can every day. This Olay product line works for me.</li>
    <li> The regenerist products are my favorite...Keeps my face moistureized...and looking great !  I don&#x27;t go without it.  Even without makeup...it makes me feel good~</li>
    <li> I have always used this product an WOULD NOT DO WITH OUT IT i have recomended it to all my  friends an will always it deserves more than 5 stars :-),,,!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use it before bed and after a shower.  My skin has never felt to smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite some time.  I was happy to order it fragrance free.  My skin looks very moisturized with&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
    <li> This product said on the front of it Moisturizer.  However,on the jar it did not say that, it said Micro Sculpting Cream, not moisturizer.  I believe they have come out with a new moisturizer product.</li>
    <li> my mother say it is ok!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream since it came on the market years ago. I love it! Like everyone we are lured into trying other brands, but it was never for long. I&#x27;m 62 yrs old and people do not believe I am. What a great feeling when someone asks what I do to have such nice wrinkle free skin! I haven&#x27;t had the need to use any makeup on my face. I just use eyeliner, Mascara and lipstick, done! ALL of the Olay products are affordable and work!</li>
    <li> The cream arrived before the delivery date, and in great condition.  This cream does help my fine lines; I have noticed a huge difference in a short period of time.  As a test, I started using this cream on the backs of my hands, and am amazed at the difference!  My hands are sun damaged, and this cream has faded the sun spots, and smoothed out the texture of my hands.  On my face, I use this cream around my eyes (crow&#x27;s feet) and along the sides of my nose and mouth.  My skin looks luminous, smooth, hydrated without being oily.  The only reason this cream did not get a five star rating is because I don&#x27;t like dipping my fingers into a jar.  I use this cream along with Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Serum, and my skin is looking fine!  Yes, I will definitely order this cream again.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Excellent product for moisture.  Use each night.  Be sure to choose the &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from the drug store in the past and it worked well.  But this time my purchase from Amazon may have been a fake or gray market product, the price was too good to be true and within a week my skin had broken out.  Will not buy this from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Love Oil of Olay - can&#x27;t believe it either because my mom used it for years but I always insisted on buying fancier products like Lancome or other creams sold over the counters at the mall - then I visited my super awesome childhood girlfriend and she is now a skin expert / aesthetician / and she told me Oil of Olay has done more research on great skincare products than any other company and they know SO much about what they produce so I started using the daily moisturizer about 4 years ago and then expanded to the other creams including the Regenerist and I must say I love it. I use this at night before sleep. I&#x27;ve come to trust Oil of Olay even though I&#x27;m not crazy about ALL their products, this one is a great overnight cream. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> No matter how many other creams I try, I always wind up back here.  I love the way my skin feels after applying this.  The cream actually feels &amp;#34;cushy&amp;#34; on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other creams might.  And with the $3.00 coupon that was applied at checkout, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Wife, she loves this product.</li>
    <li> I like Olay products.  Good price and work great!  I use them on regular basis.  Make my skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Found it to have a scent. even though claims to be fragrance free. Ended up using it very rarely because it was greasy and (to put it nicely), had a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works to moisturize my skin all day and helps fight eczema, at least it has with me.</li>
    <li> I have used many high-priced skincare items over the years, but none of them have been as effective as this cream.  I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.  Firmer, smoother, plumper, younger.    I also use this as a neck cream and an eye cream.  Since it&#x27;s fragrance-free, it can also be used above the eye, on the brow bone area.  I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this is one of the only anti-aging creams on the market that does not clog my pores or cause acne.  There are no oils listed in the ingredients; it is not greasy or occlusive.  It feels thick when you first put it on, but it sinks in quickly, leaving only a silky veil of moisture.    I have a sensitivity to fragrance, so I appreciate that this cream is available in a fragrance-free version.  Since it can also be used as a neck and eye cream, I consider it a great value.  I will no longer waste money on those other high-priced skincare lines.  I will be sticking to Regenerist Microsculpting Cream, and other Olay products.</li>
    <li> No sculpting of any sort that I can see...but a good basic cream. Gentle on skin. Moisturizes nicely. Nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> I just buy it as a present for my mother.</li>
    <li> I took part in a trial of this product and was very pleasantly surprised by what a great product it was. I had been using very expensive Estee Lauder moisturizers, but this is every bit as good and less expensive! I actually felt that my lines and wrinkles were less obvious while using this - so I&#x27;ve now switched. I have VERY sensitive dry skin, and this works very well for me (I&#x27;m in my 60s).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and, while it does make an immediate difference in the appearance of fine lines on my face, the effect wears off rather quickly. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, with respect to ingredients, that would actually make it effective over a long period of time. Won&#x27;t be ordering it again - there&#x27;s other products with ingredients that have been proven to improve the appearance of fine lines, with known mechanisms of action.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a good price on Amazon.  I buy this and the serum and they are the last two layers I use on my skin at&lt;br /&gt;night.  Has serious anti-aging ingredients that really make the difference.</li>
    <li> Good product. Less expensive online than in the store.</li>
    <li> I can definitely say that my skin feels smoother and tighter (in a good way). Totally happy with this.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. Wearing it once a day on most days for 6 weeks now.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this on the monthly program for three years now. My girlfriend and I think it&#x27;s working. PS she did have a facelift too.</li>
    <li> Excellent hydration. Glad to have the Unscented version.  Got a good price, with Amazon Prime free shipping too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for more than a year now.  It&#x27;s thick and very moisturizing yet not greasy like some other cream.  Fragrance is not too strong.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this product. She has been using it for years and is a repeat purchaser. I could not find a better price any place else, and the product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The fragrance free is a very different formula, no likey.</li>
    <li> Leaves gummy residue on my face in the morning after applying at night</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different creams.  This line is the best  Makes your skin feels wonderful.  Can&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> i have to keep her plenty stocked up on this product! She loves this better than the Olay original products and requests in for Birthdays and Christmas. When I send this product at random during the year, she gets so excited, like she&#x27;s just won the lottery. When my sister is in town, she uses up all Mom&#x27;s stock, so I&#x27;ve started shipping it to both of them.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different over the counter and department store products over the years. I started using Olay Regenerist Multi-sculpting cream a few years ago and am very pleased with the results. I find that it leaves my skin smooth, with an even tone. I purchased the fragrance-free version this last time and find I like it better than the one with the fragrance. Will continue to use this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> My mom has used this for years and now that I&#x27;m 25 I think it is time for me to use it as well before I do get fine lines. Does take like 2 weeks to notice some differences</li>
    <li> Quality cream at a good price.</li>
    <li> Its what I usually wear, so I like it alot</li>
    <li> I like this.  Seems to keep my very dry skin moist; works well under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Not sure I see fabulous results but after having tried many other more expensive products, I am back to this one.  Other products have caused drying near my eyes even though I don&#x27;t use them right under my eyes.  Soaks in quickly as well.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me this was the best facial cream to buy.  It&#x27;s light and I prefer the unscented.  I use it twice a day, and I do see a dufference.  I have tried all price ranges if creams and this one us really giid.</li>
    <li> I always  use this product and am very happy with it.The only thing, I was shocked at your price. I usually pay less. Grace Nixon</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. I have very sensitive skin so I am always happy to find a fragrance free product that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to burn.  My skin is considered normal...not too dry nor too oily.  I have had several people tell me that they can&#x27;t believe I am old enough to have kids in college (I am 47).  This product keeps my skin soft and smooth.  I put this on every night before bed.</li>
    <li> It took me a long time before I tried the Olay line, but has the same effect if not more than products that cost much more.&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious feel, amazing skin. Five Star Cream.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have combination oily/dry skin and it makes my face feel tight afterwards.  Tried the sephora face moisturizer which seemed very similar and I liked that better, so I&#x27;m still on my search for my go-to facail care. I plan on trying Shea moisture I&#x27;ve heard that brand is great.</li>
    <li> I buy this because it is a trusted brand and I think a moisturizer is important at your skin ages. I have been using this cream for a number of years so I can&#x27;t truthfully say that it is helping or not. I can say that at 68 I still have not wrinkles, but then neither does my 95 year old mother. So is it the cream or heredity?</li>
    <li> I feel such a difference with my skin since stating to use this product! People have commented on how great my skin looks and that it actually glows!</li>
    <li> Ladies you know when we hit middle age we sometimes look for those miracle in a bottle items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t a miracle, it is a damn good product.  Most of my fine little lines have disappeared, my skin looks&lt;br /&gt;and feels soft.  Will it make a 50 yr old look like a 30 yr old, no.  But it did make my skin look better, little tighter&lt;br /&gt;and absorbs fast &amp; well.  I find it worth the price and really like the product and the results.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I do like Olay products and find this one to measure up.  My only reason for the 4 star review rather than a 5 is my disappointment that it does not contain sunscreen.  I am using it but apply a sunscreen over it and am not sure if that affects it in any way thus far.</li>
    <li> Nothing thrilling about this product.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This cream goes on nice and is very creamy and fragrance free which is great for sensitive skin.  I did not see any difference in my skin and I am half way through the jar. What I don&#x27;t like about it that my face sticks a bit to my pillow at night! Also I only used it as a night cream but one time I used it before I put on my makeup and the product I use would not go on evenly. I use a pressed mineral foundation. I hate to give a product a bad rating but this one is just not for me. It works for others so maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I have tried many expensive moisturizing creams.  I have yet to find a better combination than the Regenerist  serum and this cream.  Keeps my dry skin at bay and my wrinkles less than I would have expected, at a price I never would have thought I would paid for a good skin cream.  Worth twice the price but since the price has increased of late, I shall say no more, except to say you should try it!,</li>
    <li> I was already using this product for my sensitive skin, but found it easier and more affordable to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I should have researched the ingredients before I purchased it.  It contains paraben which has been shown to cause breast cancer according to an English study and to my physician.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay regenerist as my night time cream for years. It has a nice scent and absorbs quickly. No greasy film. Leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
    <li> For under $20 a bottle, this product delivers on its promise. After using just this cream &amp; SPF 30 on my face for three weeks, I noticed a definite reduction in the pore size overall on my skin and an improvement in the elasticity as well. The cream is smooth &amp; silky with a very light feel. Once applied, I neither feel it nor notice that it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked as promised, but since it did no noticeable improvement on my pre-existing sun/laser pigmentation, I will be combining this with a glycolic acid moving forward (I&#x27;ve used Vivite daily antioxidant serum in the past &amp; will be using that in conjunction with this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: combination, Asian skin type light&lt;br /&gt;Problems: fine lines, hyper pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;Age: 30+</li>
    <li> I like this product. It moisturizers my skin very well.</li>
    <li> It is excellent. I have not found another brand that will compare to&lt;br /&gt;It.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as similar ones I bought at Macys for triple the price.</li>
    <li> I love the Regenerist line of products and this cream does not disappoint. I use this one at night and the serum during the day. Love that it&#x27;s truly fragrance free. I&#x27;ve had other fragrance free products that have an after smell I&#x27;m assuming from the ingredients in them. The Regenerist line stands up to any of the expensive department store products that promise miracles they don&#x27;t deliver so why pay more?</li>
    <li> I have everyone on this cream hooked on it, even men. lol  Because it really works.  I like this cream alot for more of a fresh and youthful look.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PRODUCT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
    <li> Great product - best price after searching the entire internet!  Look no further.....this product is for you!!</li>
    <li> A number of years ago Consumer Reports gave this moisturizing cream their highest rating.  I&#x27;ve been using it since then and people can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them my age. I also eat right, think right and take care of my health because beauty really is more than skin deep.  As the Good Book says, &amp;#34;A merry heart does good like a medicine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am giving it a 3 star because it clogs pores. :(</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, like it says it does.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 5 years an will continue too.Started with cheaper brands tried more expensive but love this product.</li>
    <li> This cream really lives up to its hype. It left my skin feeling as smooth as possible. Considering that I am pushing 80 years old, that&#x27;s saying something! I think that it&#x27;s definitely worth the money you will spend purchasing it. I would compare it favorably to the more expensive creams that you could get in a department store.</li>
    <li> I bought it during christmas, and I got a coupon on amazon, so I get $ 4 off. It is a great deal for this brilliant product! Love Olay, always!</li>
    <li> i bought this product  at a great price, and so far i am very happy with the purchase, thank you!</li>
    <li> all the past accolades, well deserved</li>
    <li> I have seen absolutely no difference in using this product at all.  It works okay for a moisturizer, but is still pretty greasy.  I ended up breaking out when using this product, which typically doesn&#x27;t happen.  I have a normal skin type.  I&#x27;m just not very happy with this purchase at all, especially considering the price.  A little of this product can go a long way, but honestly I&#x27;m ready to just throw it away because it hasn&#x27;t provided anything for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Skin looks great I can actually walk around with no foundation!</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years and like it very much.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products.  My skin is a bit sensitive and is changing as I grow older.  Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream helps maintain a youthful look without skin irritation or break out due to the product.  My skin is soft and holding steady....no miracles but I&#x27;m not asking for one in a jar...just some help.</li>
    <li> If you have a new year resolution to treat your skin better, regardless of age I&#x27;d recommend starting with this.</li>
    <li> I have tried other face creams. Olay Regenerist Miceo-Sculpting Cream, Fragrance Free, 1.7oz,&lt;br /&gt;Is the best I have found for my dry skin.  I have used other products, but will not change from this&lt;br /&gt;Product again. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 5 years now.  I love it and it does work and feels wonderful on the face.</li>
    <li> excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if its better than other products but my face is not as dry in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 2 years. I&#x27;m 61 and felt my face really needed an improvement.  I switched to Olay Pro and saw a notiecable improvement in skin tone and fine lines. I then switched to an inexpensive 12 % glycolic acid cream for daily use and saw a better improvement. Regenerist Micro-Scuplting cream serves me as a moisturizer, but other than I get really no results from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three years now and my 68 year-old-skin looks pretty bright and youthful.  Maybe there are better products on the market but I don&#x27;t want to stop using this product and find out that the new one doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> As Consumer Reports says, wrinkle creams do not do much to repair or erase wrinkles from simple aging.  Alas, that proves to be true for this product and others.  It&#x27;s a good face cream, easily absorbed, not greasy, so I can recommend it, but it does not obliterate wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Continues to work as described.</li>
    <li> DID not see any positive results with this one, it actually kinda made my skin dry. Prefer the total effects to this one. I guess  it does minimize your pore but theres very little mositurizing</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent. I have been using it for quite some time now and you can truly see a difference. It is very affordable and does just a good a job as more expensive creams do. I would definitely recommend tit. ( I recommend to buy it from OLAY  and shipped from Amazon and no  from other sellers)</li>
    <li> I had never used any other product before, and after reading many reviews, I gave this product a chance. I was amazed as to how quickly it worked. Within the first use, it left my skin smooth, and reduced the appearance of wrinkles drastically, (especially around my eyes). It does not leave your skin oily. It brightens up my skin, leaving it smooth and hydrated. It was my first time using any anti-wrinkle product, and this will be my only product from now on. I love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon requires too much info. The stars should say everything, such a a waste of time seriously.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, it goes on so nice and is not greasy.  Just a little goes a long way.  Have used it for years and would not try any other cream,</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 months morning and night after washing and has really made a difference with my under eye wrinkles. I put the night recovery over it as i have really dry skin and most day creams dont cut it! Will buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> After one week I noticed a positive difference.  The color in my skin evened out and looked brighter and less dry.  I use this about every other night before bed.  My skin has all issues you can image and I feel like the wrinkles and age spots especially are diminishing.</li>
    <li> My wife was surprised at how good this was.</li>
    <li> great product and better price than in the stores</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Love it! Makes a big difference in the suppleness of my skin and it keeps wrinkles down.</li>
    <li> Definitely not as good as I expected. I have used other Regenerist products in the past and experienced exceptional results but this was average to say the least. I had high hopes because this is supposed to be the next generation in their products but honestly you could get better results from a generic Walmart brand. On a side note I did get GREAT results from their Olay 7. For some reason that doesn&#x27;t get great reviews,  maybe people just mistakenly got the fragranced version instead?  But I would definitely recommend getting Olay 7 over this</li>
    <li> It was packed great I&#x27;m 46 with crows feet just starting to show I have oily skin big pores I have been using it morning and night 2 weeks now it&#x27;s shrunk my pores no clogging and wrinkles are slowly diminished.</li>
    <li> So nice on your face &amp; neck....smooth&lt;br /&gt;Dimishes amy wrinkles</li>
    <li> I read many positive reviews for this product, so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and don&#x27;t have many lines/wrinkles, but am concerned about the fine lines around my eyes and between my brows getting deeper.  I&#x27;ve used a LOT of products over the years.  I have combination skin and hate when facial cream makes my skin look shiny and makes my eye makeup smear.  I live in South TX, so heavy creams/lotions + heat &amp; humidity &#x3D; bad.  At first, I thought &amp;#34;Eh&amp;#34; after using this cream for a few days.  Didn&#x27;t notice anything dramatic.  But I liked that it didn&#x27;t make me shiny, even when using in the morning.  It has a nice texture and no noticeable smell.  Plus, I figured that I paid ~$20 for it, so I&#x27;d use it up and then try something else.  Well, after a few weeks, I noticed that the lines around my eyes looked much better.  My skin texture had also improved.  Since I hadn&#x27;t been using anything else, I knew it was this product.  I&#x27;m now a fan and will buy more once this jar runs out.  I only wish there was more product in the jar, hence the one-star deduction.</li>
    <li> Unless you have enough high-income to buy Skinmedica&#x27;s TNS Serum, which is probably about the same about of cream for $150 (but noticeably better than anything else), buy this.  As a 40-yr-old man with slightly-sagging skin, dark circles and wrinkles around my eyes and forehead, etc., this does wonders for the price.  Although it is comparable in price and size to the thicker equally-loved cream EB5, which is also good, this cream goes on drippier, but better endures.  When I sweat, I don&#x27;t find it running off my forehead like other creams.  Oil of Olay is owned by Proctor &amp; Gamble, which is basically the quintessential old American company that always has high-quality consumer products for a reasonable price (e.g., Tide/Cheer/Gain/Febreze). Another winner here for them.</li>
    <li> item arrived promptly and in fine order. Just what I ordered. I use this 2-3 times a week. It&#x27;s good. I sometimes swab lemon juice on my face then rub in some of the olay cream. Sleep on it and the next morning I can see the freshness in my face. I&#x27;m a guy but want to keep up my looks as long as possible. I wish olay would consider putting out some product for men. Just skip all the confusing titles to your products....us guys like to keep it simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product does fine and the shipper got it to me in fine shape and very quickly......kudos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years ago I would&#x27;ve laughed and rolled my eyes at the thought of using a women&#x27;s night cream. But that was then....and this is now.</li>
    <li> I use this wonderful cream over the micro sculpting serum in the morning.  Keeps my skin soft and smooth all day long.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers well however I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  Iʻve been using it for 2 years, and itʻs all the great things that people say it is.  I recently ran out of it and decided, for convenience, to open a subscription with Amazon and have a jar sent to me every two months.  I received my first order a couple days ago.  As soon as I put it on my face, I noticed it was different. The formula that I&#x27;m used to always left my face feeling plump and soft, but this formula didnʻt do that at all.  I looked at the jar and noticed it looked different from the empty jar of cream that I had used before.  Mostly everything about the two jars was the same, except the one I got from Amazon was a deeper color red, and the silver cover did not say OLAY on the top (like it does in the photos on Amazon). When I picked up and read the box, it said MADE IN THAILAND.  I went back to the Amazon website to read itʻs product description, and it clearly says MADE IN THE US.  So I called the OLAY number that was on the box to speak to a representative.  After explaining the situation, she said basically that they are a global company and have factories and distribution centers all over the world, but that any Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream sold in the USand Canada is made in Puerto Rico.  So..neither the USA or Thailand.  She went on to say I would have to speak to the seller to find out where they are receiving their product from.  So I called Amazon and spoke to a Customer Service Rep, and he didn&#x27;t really have an answer for me either, just saying that he will notify those in charge that the product description doesnʻt match the actual product. He did cancel my subscription, and refunded me the cost of the first jar.  Overall, the return experience was awesome, I had no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isnʻt to say things made in Thailand arenʻt good quality, but this formula is just different.  It could be a number of factors...the difference in the water...who knows.  Bottom line is, I ordered a product that Amazon is advertising as MADE IN THE US and received something MADE IN THAILAND, that had suspicious packaging and felt different.  I would save yourself the trouble of returns and buy it from your local drugstore until Amazon figures out where their product is coming from.n is advertising as MADE IN THE US and received something MADE IN THAILAND, that had suspicious packaging and felt different.

    <li> I have purchased so many products that say they are fragrance free only to have to throw them out.  This is the real deal, so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for years and this as well as their moisture cream are the best i have ever used.</li>
    <li> After about 3 weeks I saw a dramatic difference in my skin texture.  This cream has provided a lifted quality to my skin which I had previously described as &#x27;dragging&#x27; skin.  There was a gentle sag to both my neck and cheek area.  I was amazed at how it tightened my skin!  I use this product in tandem with a few other anti-aging products and the results are really quite remarkable.  My pores are terrifically minimized; there is a silkier, fresher, brighter look and feel to my skin.  Although I credit my other products for a lot of the great results I&#x27;m experiencing, I totally credit Regenerist for the lifting and tightening, and doing so without irritating my skin which is very, very sensitive.  Bravo Olay Regenerist!</li>
    <li> After reading a few reviews on here, I decided to buy this AT CVS.. I am glad I did. MINE does not look like this photo here.. Mine does NOT have a stuck on label, as shown in this photo. I am totally assuming this is not the real deal,and I wish Amazon would not sell it!</li>
    <li> works ok, didn&#x27;t see any real results as the jar was finished up, so for price I wld try another product next time</li>
    <li> It has more body without being greasey  and leaves my skin ready for the regenerist  serum cream  for under make-up.</li>
    <li> Rehydrates my skin..I will buy it again..It makes my skin look and feel soft and revitlalized, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream on my face for about 2 years. It is thick and I have found that it provides extra needed moisture in the winter and fall months (I live in COLO). I find that I rely on it to keep my face nicely hydrated in the winter. I do not use it during the summer months because it is too heavy and makes my face feel sticky. I think that my light wrinkles decrease when I am using this cream. I have sensitive and acne prone skin and this cream does not irritate it.</li>
    <li> I love how well this makes my face feel! It keeps me so moisturized! I got it as a sample in my vox box and I&#x27;ll never use another moisturizer again</li>
    <li> I originally got the version with fragrance, and decided to go with this one to try and cut out more of the ingredients/chemicals.  It works just as well as the normal version, which is awesome.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Light cream, seems to be absorbed easily, and, most importantly, it does not bother my ultra-sensitive skin. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Always makes my face look better.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Delivered very quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I am not so sure it really does what is claimed.  I do not see any real difference in my skin after 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a year or so and liked it, but when I decided to order more, I did not realize it had the parabens in it and I thought most companies were beginning to discontinue them.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and she is very please with....Espicially since she was able to buy it a very good Price...Thank you.</li>
    <li> This oil of olay helps firm my face. I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it. It really works for me. I highly recommend it to help improve the texture of your skin.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this cream , she says it keeps her younger, as a husband who am I to argue.</li>
    <li> I just received my order to see the same thing as the reviewer below- instead of the US product I was also shipped the one made in Thialand! I am extra dissapointed because I bought the one offered w/ the prime link, which ended up being a few $ more than everyone else from what I can see!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I use it with the serum, been on both products for about three years,  makes my facial skin feels tight and smooth.</li>
    <li> Normally I love the Regenerist line. Not this time! I was disappointed in this cream. It is horribly sticky when you first apply no matter the amount you use, then by morning it is a dry looking mess. I would not purchase it again... EVER!</li>
    <li> I finally tried the Olay product due to the review of Angie @ hotandflashey on youtube. This product is not for me, gave me pimples at at 58, I used it for 30 days and did not see one change.</li>
    <li> It is okay, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used 4 jars of this wonderful cream and am very happy with the results. When Olay came out with their Luminous line, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. While I like the moisturizing effect of the Luminous cream, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel the same as with the Micro- Sculpting Cream. I love how my skin feels softer and smoother with this product.  Olay is a great line of products and there are enough options to go around; just use what is best for your skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price</li>
    <li> Face seems better since I have used this for a month.</li>
    <li> This product and the micro-sculpting serum did not do anything for me. In fact, it made me break out &amp; get bumps everywhere that took forever to go away. I&#x27;m 25 and while I do have dry skin, I would say it is not exactly sensitive. I used both at the same time, so I am not sure if it was a reaction to one in particular or both.&lt;br /&gt;It also does not work well under my mineral makeup. It gave me that &#x27;caked&#x27; look that I hate. Therefore, I was only able to use it at night, even though it says use both day &amp; night on the bottles. It left a sticky feeling on my skin afterwards as well. I just switched back to the other Olay products, namely Olay Daily Regenerating Serum &amp; Olay Deep Hydration Cream.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Didnt do what it said it would. Would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I discovered by accident that this product helps to take down the inflamation of eczema  and psoriasis and helps to smooth the  skin overnight!  I use it in combination with the Psorzema cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now 71 and have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream for about 3 years.  I am constantly complimented on how much younger I look.  My skin is firmer.  I apply extra to the area under the chin area so that I can forestall the bagginess that occurs.  I pushed my daughters to just try it and they are now as loyal as I am.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years. When I first started, I noticed improvement right away, and it&#x27;s continued to give me great results.  I use this at night and the micro-sculpting serum during the day. I get frequent compliments about how smooth, even and soft my skin looks.  I&#x27;m 54 and did not do a good job of protecting my skin from the sun in my younger years, but this product seems to be helping my face to fight Father Time so far.</li>
    <li> I get the product shipped from amazon (from my mother) and I have also purchased it from the store, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference. I wanted to write a review to tell my skin story. I have been using this product religiously for the past 4 years, since I was 18. I ALWAYS get compliments on my skin. Around April/May when I was getting my final work in before graduation and when the weather was changing to being warmer, my skin was getting a little oily, so I stopped using this moisturizer. Boy, what a mistake. Breakouts non stop! I bought tons of products and medicated moisturizers to help, and it only led to more breakouts. Finally, now August, my subscription of moisturizer came and I figured I might as well throw that on top of the break outs. It couldn&#x27;t really hurt. Well, that was my problem. In days, my skin is back to normal and I&#x27;m getting compliments again. This is truly a great product! Use it before you need it!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, not greasy, not exorbitantly priced and has no irritants in it like the more expensive face creams. I do not look younger, firmer, sculpted and all that phony marketing garbage, but it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very smooth. Goes on well without sticky or waxy feeling. Absorbed quickly. Used over Regenerist serum &amp; skin is looking better after only a few weeks. Fewer uneven skin spots. I really like this. It&#x27;s gentle, available @ drug stores, great deal on Amazon subscription plan.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years &amp; usually get it from CVS. When I found it here for a cheaper price I thought it was great. However when the package arrived it look suspicious because- (1) The bottle has different lettering that what&#x27;s depicted in the picture here &amp; different from my prior bottle from CVS. It has in big letters &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; written below &amp;#34;Regenerst&amp;#34;, (2). The smell is completely different. Supposed to be fragrance-free but it smells funny, (3). It&#x27;s made in a different country than the bottle from CVS was made (not putting here out of respect for thy country).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning it as this looks like a fake &amp; I would definitely not use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have very very sensitive skin and also I&#x27;m extremely scent sensitive.  I don&#x27;t have any reactions to this product and it is scent free. I like how it makes my skin feel when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working I need another month but I like the way my skin feels..Great price and order came quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every day over the course of two weeks, and I have to conclude that it doesn&#x27;t work for me. Every night, on average, I would gain one or two new pimples/whiteheads on my face, or, if I was lucky, I wouldn&#x27;t get any pimples at all (until the next night). I can&#x27;t find any reason to explain this other than the fact that I must be sensitive to one of the ingredients. I don&#x27;t consider my skin too sensitive; I have combination skin that tends to be more oily than dry, I get perhaps a handful of pimples every year, which is more due to high stress/bad eating periods than to naturally high oil production. I only use lotions and creams on my face, no makeup, and I&#x27;m 20 years old with no medical skin condition. I was hoping for this product to be the most effective night cream at its price point, and it may very well be the case for the majority, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking a look at the ingredients list, I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s better than most night creams (which is primarily why I bought it), with nianicimide being the fourth ingredient, panthenol being the 9th, and tocopherol acetate being the 10th. The rest of the list is composed of stabilizers, thickening agents, moisturizers, etc. Nothing that sticks out except those controversial parabens, and you have to decide for yourself if they&#x27;re harmful. I have to point out that this cream still retains a slight floral, cosmetic scent despite advertising itself as fragrance-free, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable and the smell seems to dissipate sooner than my other cream, which has \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; at the very bottom of its ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the application itself; it seems to be a \\&quot;light\\&quot; night cream. I was better off using a small amount and rubbing it in than dolloping a lot on and smearing it about. (When I used more, it seemed to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on my face as if it was a paste, leaving white streaks.) The skin absorbs it very quickly, within 5-10 minutes and you&#x27;re set for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product two stars because everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I must be one of those unlucky few that are sensitive to certain key ingredients, and because I can still use this for my hands. The glass jar is also pretty sturdy and I plan to use it to store odds and ends when I run out of cream.</li>
    <li> good and my mother love it. according to her its very effective. next time  will try other products of oil of olay.</li>
    <li> It works very well, though it doesn&#x27;t do much for the deep wrinkles in my forehead, which my Mom also had. sigh. Also, Olay keeps coming out with newer products that appear to work a little better, and I don&#x27;t know if this has been overtaken or not. And I&#x27;m scraping the bottom of the jar. Time to look at the Olay website to see what their latest is this week...&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, fragrance free cause people can be put off by fragrance. And though theirs tend to be lovely, I have to please my peeps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement to my skin, not even in the slightest.  It is just like any other hyped up lotion. Plus the price is ridiculous.  It is robbery.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr Oz as a good moisturizer at a decent price and have been using it for over 6 months and have found a few lines to have decreased and keeps my skin well hydrated. No need for the very expensive products he said and for me he was right. I like this no perfume one. It is also cheaper on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am getting this one every 2-3 months. Amazon offers $3 off that makes better deal than local store or Sam&#x27;s club. I am 50 but still look fine without much wrinkles. I believe this product helps. I also bought it for my sister. She likes it too.</li>
    <li> This product shows results immediately. I have been using Olay for years and have gotten compliments on how clear and soft my face it. This cream is thick but glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make ur face greasy.</li>
    <li> Provides good moisture for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product that works. Maybe not like magic but with time it does remove fine lines. Good service.</li>
    <li> Although this product seems to moisturize fairly well, it also has &amp;#34;glitter.&amp;#34; This is not clearly stated online or on the packaging.  I called Olay and they said the ingredient mica is the glitter, this ingredient to make it appear as though your lines and wrinkles are less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure a product with glitter/frost look is fine for a night out on the town, but for day to day, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Great for overall night treatment. Non greasy no smell and creamy. As for the results, I am not sure since I do not believe that one can fight aging. I wish that olay eliminate the use of parabens in the formulations.</li>
    <li> Works! A friend of mine says her dermatologist told her its the number one seller and works best in its field. I purchased some. It does work great. I use it twice a day. No irritation or anything. Buy it and try it. I believe you can return it if not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I made such a mistake using this product on my face. I am 26 with very minimal sun damage and thought it would give my skin a little boost. Within 24 hours of using the product everywhere it put it was broken out with huge cystic acne. Especially along my jaw line (where the box said to put it to see the best results). Maybe I am too young to be using anti aging products, but i&#x27;ve never had a lotion cause such extreme acne so quick.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any of the amazing benefits everyone else claims to have seen. Granted I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines yet, but I did hope it would help with some of the acne marks I had, but it did not. Plus, it left my skin super oily up to two days after use. Of course each person&#x27;s skin will react differently, but this didn&#x27;t really work for my skin. It may work for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia. :)</li>
    <li> Will look for a shipper closer to home and lower price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since last year. I used to buy it in Costco, but now Cost co only has the luminous type , the type made my face itchy. I try to look for the old type with the red jar and I found it on Amazon. Excellent !</li>
    <li> If you are into fragrance-free lotions, this is it. Nice thickness to make your skin feel moisturized. But not too heavy. One of my go-to lotions!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best face cream!  Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Olay products before and liked them. However, this one leaves a residue on my face. Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting because several articles highly recommended it.  My skin has been drier than usual this winter and I needed something more moisturizing then the brand I had been using.  I have had this for about two weeks and my dry patches have disappeared.  It does not feel heavy or oily and quickly absorbs into my skin so I can apply my makeup without delay.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for decades and loved every one, until this micro-sculpting cream. It is not like the ones I have bought at drug stores. This one drags on my skin when I apply it instead of going on easily. After using it as directed for just one week, I noticed tiny wrinkles I didn&#x27;t have before plus furrows (?) between my eyebrows. I thought this was made in the USA but it says Thailand. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s significant but another reviewer mentioned that as well. I went back to my regular Olay product in the white container and amazingly, my skin went back to how it was before I started using this. I plan to call the company as well and ask them what&#x27;s up with this. I love Olay except for this.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite cream for all times , it keep my skin hydrated for 12 hours, it is water based and amazing under any make up as it prevent of the make up breakage , I use it from the first day it was in production until now, it last 1 month if you use daily . I use it in the morning and I am still free from any wrinkles , it give me 10 years back for real, it is not wonder cream but it is just so good for preventing wrinkle formation , young people don;t care about wrinkles but when they get it they look for miracle , the answer is to not allow them forming and prevent it for ever using good cream like this one , nothing else works for me ...and I hope they will never stop producing it , this cream was number 1 last year for the most effective in preventing of wrinkle formations on dry and mixed skin type</li>
    <li> Work as advertised. Your skin will look younger, smoother, and have more even tone</li>
    <li> Very good value.  I live in the deep south and use it during the winter, fall and spring.  A little too heavy in the summer for my skin, even though I&#x27;m over 50.</li>
    <li> This was an okay moisturizer.  I have very dry skin and am always looking for a good moisturizer.  This one wasn&#x27;t very remarkable, but it is fragrance free, which is nice.  I liked the consistency of the cream.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and this might be just the moisturizer for someone else.</li>
    <li> I can really tell the difference in my skin after using this product for about 30 days. It is a thick cream that I apply right before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Olay Regenerist and got a great price by ordering through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great price; great delivery;. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I didn&#x27;t notice any remarkable changes other than my skin is less dry.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they call it &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; - sculpting.  I is fragrance free, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> We bought this after going through several different reviews and my wife thinks that this product really works great. After few uses she felt like her skin has gotten smoother and softer adding little bit of complexion too. Some of the blemishes have become lighter as well. A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, she was using the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Regenerating Serum Moisturizer and liked it very much but this product is her new favorite these days. Costco sells a twin-pack for around $36 and we usually stock up a year supply when there is a coupon on it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for just a few weeks and already notice an improvement in my 63 year old skin. It seems tighter and firmer. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This really works and tightens areas especially under the jaw and around the neckline. It is also not greasy so I use it before going to work.</li>
    <li> I got this cream a month ago and I have been blown away. It removed all of the dark marks, made my skin even toned, super soft, UN-GREASEY, no fine lines, and I can go almost entirely make-up free! So I have splurged and bought the $120 creams from Macey&#x27;s before and I swear to god this does BETTER then any I have tried! I really love this stuff :) I only wish they made it in a Sam&#x27;s club value size...</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a long time....thinking of trying the NEW Olay regenerist that has just come out so hope I can get it through Amazon.  May take a while.  But this product produces very nice results for my skin and I&#x27;m 64 and had always been a sun worshipper. Plus it comes &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; as I don&#x27;t like to smell my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> bought this product because of the great reviews. it turned out to be the worst skin care product i have ever bought. It does not moisturize. just sits on your skin and if you sweat with it, the white from the cream goes from clear to visible. it has irritated my skin despite being fragrance free. i have red marks, bumps, itching. then to top it off, it has made my pores HUGE (ALL THE TIME!!) which is a condition i have never had before. I can see that there is some white in the pores when i get out of the shower. totally scary. has not given me a lift or made the lines get better. only thing it did was make my skin feel smooth. big deal. i&#x27;d rather have the nice skin i started with. seriously, i had nice skin before using this product. this product is a nightmare. last time i had such a bad reaction to skin treatment was when i used cold cream. it was the worst for my skin. i think this product may have some in it too. FYI: now that i&#x27;m looking for products to correct my problem from this stuff it has come to my attention that loreal paris triple action has the same 3 top ingredients as olay micro sculpting garbage. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT BAD SKIN!! I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD!!</li>
    <li> Seems to moisturize nicely, without leaving face oily or sticky. Not sure of the line minimizing effects yet, but I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hurting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years now.  I went to see a dermatologist for the 1st time last week and he asked me how I was 42 but looked 25.  Enough said...</li>
    <li> What a great price for a great cream.</li>
    <li> It was expired before sold!</li>
    <li> Makes my face too oily</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different anti-aging creams, serums and lifters, nothing works better than this. I am 33 yrs old. I started using creams for aging when I turned 29. I have been using Olay products since I was 12. Everyone says that I look like I&#x27;m 20 yrs old. I have no lines, wrinkles and my face has a glowing youthful appearance. Hence, I hardly ever wear make-up. This is a must have, but to all women in your twenties-you need to start using anti-aging products before signs of aging, not after. It makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Theis product arrived on time, packaged well.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance - free as I was allergic to its earlier version that had a fragrance. It absorbs well into the skin, not greasy.</li>
    <li> i love this regenerist cream and am THRILLED it is finally available in fragrance free (the fragrance in the other version is just yucky).  my husband has even been known to dip in and use this on his face.  good moisturizer and no cloying scent to fight with your perfume.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks, I totally see firmer softer skin. My jowls are shrinking and my nasal folds are more shallow. Will never get suckered into more expensive creams, this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best product of its kind. Non greasy and goes on great. This product does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I am 80 yrs old, and just the other day while shopping, I met a lovely lady about my age.  She asked me how did I keep my face looking so soft and clear.  I smile ta her and just said OLAY.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Olay for over 7yrs.  And I guess I shall coninue until the big boss upstairs calls me home.</li>
    <li> I started using this creme when my Grandmother (who has been using this same cream for 15 years) saw how my hands were after a hard day&#x27;s work when I was working as a plumber&#x27;s assistant. She gave me about 1/4 of the bottle she had left because my hands were so dry they were cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That changed with using this creme twice a day on my hands, and they looked like I was a white collar worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this lotion on my feet, which as a martial artist and healthcare worker (now) running around all day make them calloused and awful looking. I use a pumice stone and foot scrub and end with applying this lotion to them twice daily now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I do keep a seperate bottle for my face, It does not clog my pores and leaves my skin looking radiant, not too dry or too oily. I have combination skin so a non-comedogenic face cream is a must for me. My only wish is that there would be a spf for the day creme so I wouldn&#x27;t have to apply another layer of sun protection to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered this is a wonderful product and although usually I look for the bargain brands, I&#x27;m willing to pay a higher price for the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item 8 months before repurchasing. The repurchased item was in a different packaging (&amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; was on the lid), but I assumed the formula was the same. I like matte finishes on my face makeup...and I kept noticing my skin was quite glittery the day I wore this. I swatched everything that I had on my face onto my hand to find out what had these blue/gold sparkles in it. Low and behold, it was this moisturizer. I could not find anywhere where this product was made on the packaging...which concerned me. I miss the old formula. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy this again and will try different, more natural, paraben free moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good service.</li>
    <li> This is very different. It isn&#x27;t greasy in the least. It has no odor at all. My skin feels smoother but I can&#x27;t say if my laugh lines have lessened( don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; word). Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that. But so far I&#x27;m pleased and hopeful. Update- I used this every nite for about a month &amp; then about every third night the second month- I cut back because a brown spot on my cheek looked irritated but after 3 months the spot is barely there at all. It has faded and shrunk remarkably. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I don&#x27;t think its moisturizing at all. I use regular Olay for sensitive skin in the morning and serum after that and will be a faithful user from now on!</li>
    <li> Excellent and a very nice size.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well with my skin.  I have rosacea which I managed to keep under control using products that are fragrance free.  Although this product is fragrance free and for sensitive skin, it immediately felt like my skin was burning and lasted that way for a few days.  It took some time before my skin healed from the burn effect.  I used very, very little to spot test this product and that spot remained red and inflamed for a few days.  It was just not right for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and appreciate the fact that it comes in non-scented.  After trying other facial creams, some much more costly, I continue to go back to Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream.  I&#x27;ve found nothing else as effective for my skin and can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  It is not greasy or oily, is lightweight, and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Purchased multiple Olay products in the past and found them to be the best value and available when needed.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell, but I like the silky texture - a little goes a long way, and it has not irritated my sensitive skin.  Whether it can help my 65 year old wrinkles remains to be seen.</li>
    <li> Could not really tell any difference so far.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer for those of us with older drier skin.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if there will be dramatic results in terms of saggy jowls - hope so!</li>
    <li> I think the prodact is face. I had the worst reaction. My face filled with red spots and itching. I dont recomend, it appears that the product is manufactured in foreign country and not us. Like olay product should</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t use this cream my face loses its scaffolding.</li>
    <li> Best price out there and something I have been using for a couple months now. With these types  of things, one has to use consistently and wait to see results. I think it works. Shipping is fast too.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, moisturizes well and I like that it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I am at that certain age when I need GOOD face cream...and I need frangrance free.  I&#x27;ve spent big money on other fragrance-free face creams and tried every off-the-shelf product I could find.  Not only is Olay Regenerist the best one, it&#x27;s the only one as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  This is just a dang good face cream, period.  If you like fragrance then by all means get the regular.  If you are like me and need fragrance free this is the one.  I ran out and had trouble getting more (the stores are always out of it), so I decided to try someting new and went to Sephora...big mistake!  I paid almost $200 for a &#x27;premium&#x27; product, used it twice, and took that crap right back to the store.  No comparison!  So I ordered this cream from Amazon (1/8 of the price, mind you) and as God is my witness I will never go without Regenerist again.</li>
    <li> it&amp;#34;s great!Very good, cream is not greasy，absorption，i love it and buy it again</li>
    <li> great face cream in the market. I love this cream more than my SK2 stem power and La Mer.  quickly absorb and tighten my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Happy that Amazon Prime had the unscented version.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream! I have been using this stuff for years!</li>
    <li> Great price compared to various retail stores.  Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream is easy to apply, nice moisture based and not&lt;br /&gt;too thick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now and love it as a face cream for night.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and leaves my face feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> been using for years.  good product reasonably priced on amazon.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years!  Now use it with the serum!</li>
    <li> been using this for years. since I was 21. now 40. does a great job with my skin, not a wrinkle yet!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Olay products are great.  I am over 60 years old, and the regenerist micro-sculpting cream is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Please see my previous review for the serum. It will keep you appearing younger than you are and, when used in conjunction with the serum, will drastically reduce the appearance of age spots and wrinkles. I passed for over 15 years younger than my age without even trying -- no makeup! Have used Oil of Olay since my early 20, am now 67</li>
    <li> My wife fell in love with it after use.</li>
    <li> I heard so many rave reviews about this product and how it was better than most of the more expensive products out there.  I have to say that I really have not been that impressed with it.  I really saw no difference in my skin and I went through 2 jars before I passed judgement on it!  I also find that it doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin well and leaves a film on my skin.  This doesn&#x27;t work well if you want to wear it under make-up.</li>
    <li> Every once in a while, I try a different moisturizer just to see if there is something better out there. I always come back to Regenerist. It works without becoming greasy. Make-up goes well over it. If you think it will take &amp;#34;years&amp;#34; off your appearance, please don&#x27;t think this or any other product like it is the fountain of youth. Moisturized skin looks bettter than unmoisturized skin and that is what this product does.</li>
    <li> I love this product, keeps my face feeling nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to put on make-up in the morning before going out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and have recommended it to many friends, including my 73 year old guy friend who is also in love with it!  I&#x27;m a 37 year old male btw.  People started commenting the day after I started using this stuff on how great I looked.  It really smooths everything out!  I&#x27;m not really wrinkled to begin with, but this probably took a few years off.  I&#x27;m addicted now.  Glad I found it for a bit cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> good fragrance free moisturizer for people with sensitive skin.  Glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> I love Olay!  I have used Erno Laszlo and did love their line of products!  However, for my money, Olay is perfect for me.  I use the Regenerist line-the daily facials both in the morning and evening, along with the serum in the morning and this one at night.  It works wonders!  I can really tell a difference if I don&#x27;t follow my typical routine.  I always have lots of compliments on my skin and I never wear make-up!</li>
    <li> Love it - smooth feeling, not greasy - skin feels wonderful - I see results already after only a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> I do like most Oil of Olay Products. At my age I do not expect miracles but I like the softness of my skin and there seems to be a few less noticeable lines.</li>
    <li> I got it for my mom. This was her second jar. The first one was from a brick and mortar store. Amazon has the same thing at a great price as always. Evey one&#x27;s skin is different. If it helps we are of  South Asian descent and it suited her skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> My only wish is that there would be a spf for the day creme so I wouldn&#x27;t have to apply another layer of sun protection to my face.I got this cream a month ago and I have been blown away.</li>
    <li> absorbs in to the skin without making the face look shinny and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Excellent moisturizer for all skin types</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it works; however, it wasn&#x27;t until the second time I used it did I look carefully at the ingredients. It has aluminum in it which most definitely does not work for people with kidney disease. So I will have to find something elese.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife for Christmas. It was exactly what she was looking for! Item came on time.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and will never stop.</li>
    <li> Always a great product</li>
    <li> As a cult product, this moisturizer lives up to its hype. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle product or anything, since I have seen better results with higher end cream. But for a drugstore product, I think this is well worth it. If you&#x27;re on a budget, this is a solid choice.</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream, I needed something that did not have any perfume smell and this works very well.  My skin is loving it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer as it goes on easily using a small amount, leaves your face feeling soft, not sticky and stays with me more than 24 hours in warm months and at least 16 hours during the winter. Face appears smooth; the moisturizer serves as a great foundation for makeup when it is used.  The surface of my face appears smoother after regular use of this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used the plain Olay in the past and liked it. Now that I&#x27;m in my 50s I needed something more for firmness and winkles around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using the Olay for about 3 weeks now and this morning noticed a marked improvement around my eyes and in firmness too. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t find it hydrating and will need to find an spf moisturizer to go with it. Otherwise I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> My skin is well moisturized, but not greasy or oily. I live where the winter temps are very low &amp; have seen no dryness while using this moisturizer. I plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who is 57. She has great skin and is just showing some ageing signs now. She does not use any skin products and she is sensitive to strong fragrances. She loves this. She has been using it for two weeks now. Of course it is too soon to say if there are any effects. But she likes that it fragrance free and she says it is light and completely non- oily, yet leaves her face feeling soft and moisturized. Will update this review after a few months with anti ageing effects if any.</li>
    <li> Great overnight cream. Works better than brands I am embarrassed to say I have spent well over $100 for at the department store and Sephora. I tried switching recently to Loreal and it was a huge mistake, the Olay cream leaves my skin conditioned, hydrated and definitely decreases the very fine lines that are beginning to creep up now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love Olay, this is one of the best cream I&#x27;ve had. For the price I pay it gives the best result on my face, and not to mention it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
    <li> very good,I love it very much.</li>
    <li> the bottle do not the same with China&#x27;s counter selling.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with the cream, as it seemed to help in smoothness and feels so nice.  I WOULD SAY I FEEL MY SKIN LOOKS BETTER AND HEALTHIER.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay products for years. The product I received was made in Thailand not the US. After using for 2-3 weeks I developed a swollen, itchy lip as well as a peel on my lip and skin below it. I had to purchase hydrocortisone cream and a non-soap cleanser and stopped using the product. The lip is nearly healed. I was really disappointed in this product. I have since called Olay and they are sending me a coupon to purchase another product. Their customer service rep was very helpful. I&#x27;m confident that Amazon would have refunded my money but felt that Olay should know bout this.</li>
    <li> I ususally buy this in walgreens or Rite Aid, but I was dissappointed when I went to the pharmacy, and the price of it was $7.00 more than what i was use to paying....Geesh! it was pricey to begin with....I left some cream in the little jar so that I can compare to the one i bought online,  i felt like the one i bought it the pharmacy the ffragrance was more potent than the one online.  the letters in the bottle are very differnt and the one i bought online was made in thailand....i started using it so im wondering if it will do the same thing as the one i bought in the pharmacy...</li>
    <li> Got it for low price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to bring back the natural glow and beauty in your skin. It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, but you will start to see a noticeable difference within a couple of weeks of daily use. I use the Regenerist face wash at night and apply the micro-sculpting cream in the morning. Thank you Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this every night. I only use it during the winter when the air is very dry. It is comparable to department store brands that are much more expensive. My dermatologist tells me that the pharmacy brands sell so much more product that there R&amp;D budgets dwarf the expensive brands and their products are better. He&#x27;s right. He also never tries to sell me $100 sunscreen. He&#x27;s a good doctor, but I digress. This is a great product that will reduce lines on your face and keep it moisturized. Fragrance free is the way to go, also.</li>
    <li> Noticeable results after about 10 days</li>
    <li> love, and use all the time</li>
    <li> Its a very good product and has a better price if you compare it with other creams and other brands. I like all about this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It feels very good on the skin and I am pleased with the results&lt;br /&gt;after applying foundation.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used some pretty pricey products! My skin is softer than it has ever been and the lines on my face have softened. I use the cream every evening, right before bed as it can be a touch greasy. The price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 12/28/15 -  I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 star and should be 0 stars. This is the second time I ordered this product through Amazon. The first time the product was wonderful  and I was pleased. I ordered a 2nd jar, which I did not use right away as I was finishing the first. Therefore, the seller will not refund/replace since it was over 30 days. The product I received (from Pharmapack), which was fulfilled through Amazon.com, was not the same. It is very thick and hard to remove from jar. When I applied to my face it was gross and sticky. My face immediately started to burn and turn red. I have used this product for several years and have never had a problem. I don&#x27;t think this product is the genuine Regenerist and I would advise to be very careful before ordering from Pharmapack. I am very disappointed.[[ASIN:B007M81B4M Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Face Cream Moisturizer, Fragrance-Free 1.7 oz.]]</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product, My skin feels so soft and healthy, at 53 my skin still has that youthful glow and my wrinkles and crows feet are a lot less noticeable.</li>
    <li> this is for my mom and she love it this is great for keeping my skin healthy.great product. i recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Just started using this about a week ago.  I don&#x27;t feel that this is enough time to make an informed decision on this product.</li>
    <li> Quality product at a great price.  I have been using this product for a couple months now and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at other stores, but you can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I have been using it for 7 years and pretty much that&#x27;s it. My skin looks like I&#x27;m 20. No one can believe I&#x27;m 35 and always ask me what cremes I use.. THIS IS IT!! So besides good genes (which I have like most people do ) this creme has done it.</li>
    <li> Im 27 and this is my favorite moisturizer!  I suffer from VERY dry skin and nothing has seemed to help.  I use it at night and in the morning, Im good to go!</li>
    <li> Great . I  use it  with their cleanser.</li>
    <li> I needed a neck cream as I am 52 and neck is looking bad. With bleach cream has got alot better in time</li>
    <li> I have super dry sensitive skin, and this is by far the best moisturizer I have found. I&#x27;ve bought all kinds of sensitive skin products, and none of them ever provide enough moisture. I can&#x27;t say it does a lot for wrinkles, mine look less pronounced but I believe that is from my skin finally being hydrated. Either way, I will continue to use this product as long as I can find the fragrance-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, do not buy the regular micro sculpting cream. I did so by accident and it caused irritation and redness. This, however, makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and love how my skin feels and looks.  I decided to try the fragrance fee version this time, and really like it.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their skin looking great.</li>
    <li> This is rated so high and I&#x27;ve been trying to use all natural products but I thought I&#x27;d try this because of the ratings and my skin needed an extra boost.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed in this product are lengthy and some of the items are questionable. Once I found out they test on animals...I returned it!</li>
    <li> It was mixed with lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product for me. me. I love that it is unscented. My skin feels so smooth after I use it. I never could use the product with fragrance. This is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot until Ii started learning more about parabens and there are parabens in it; so I&#x27;ve stopped using it for now. Otherwise it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> This product moisturized my face and does not promote breakouts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with Olay, but this made my face break out, which has never happened before with any facial product. I ended up using it on my dry legs just to not have to throw it out (I&#x27;m frugal).</li>
    <li> Great production and has the amazing effection on my face. It&#x27;s really good for me and my face become better than better. really worth to try and use it.</li>
    <li> Great and cheap day cream. I don&#x27;t think it prevents wrinkles or aging; it is just a non-greasy day cream without fragrance. It is okay.</li>
    <li> Love Olay.  I&#x27;ve used this cream for years.  I try others, but always come back to this.  I recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I hawed and hummed over this product and broke down and purchased it.  I&#x27;m extremely happy i did.  You will see a difference in how your face looks within a few days.  My daughter now uses it too and even our hairdresser asked us what we are using on our skin...  Telling you..it works!</li>
    <li> I can tell there&#x27;s visible firming of the face! Very happy with this! Only downside would be the texture of the cream is a little cheap, but so long the effects are good I can live with it.</li>
    <li> Just plain bad.  It burnt my skin and now I pay the price.  Beware.  Good for some and not for others.  Do your research.</li>
    <li> Great price vs retailers!</li>
    <li> Hard to choose face creams with thousands out there, but this seems just right for night time.</li>
    <li> It FEELS VERY LIGHT BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK,I STARTED USING THIS FACIAL CREAM SINCE ABOUT 2-19-15 and I DON&#x27;T FEEL THIS WORKS !! I WAS HOPING IT WOULD&#x27;VE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE BUT THOUGH I&#x27;VE TOLD MANY TIMES I LOOK GREAT FOR A FEMALE IN HER FIFTIES I WANTED TO IMPROVE MY NASAL LABIAL WRINKLES  BUT THIS CREAM JUST DIDN&#x27;T DO THING TO IMPROVE MY SKIN,</li>
    <li> I live in the desert. This really help keep my face hydrated.</li>
    <li> Been using Lancome serums with my Olay total effects but still was getting irritation.  Since switching to the Regenerist fragrance free serum and this cream, I have not had any irritation, no itching and no dry looking skin.  YAH!!!  I have very sensitive skin and since I am 53 it is drier than it used to be.  I just got the  night recovery cream for nightime use.  I am really glad that i wont have to get the Lancome anymore.  It did the job like evenness of skin but with a 200 dollar pricetag...well, nuff said.  Usually when i switch to a new product by the third day I am running to wash it off due to burning but NOT with this one!!  I will continue to buy it!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality cream at a great price!</li>
    <li> please see my review for serum...as I am using these together...and they really really work...fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing cream at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> product provides results,</li>
    <li> I will return this item. This came suspiciously without a box, the cover sealed with plastic so poorly/haphazardly. The container felt different from the previous ones I&#x27;ve had. Looks fake. If it wasn&#x27;t, and I was wrong, I&#x27;d be surprised as hell.</li>
    <li> Just ok. It is very thick. It&#x27;s probably just a bit too much for my 30 year old skin. Also I do not like skincare products to have any scent and this one does.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find scent free.</li>
    <li> Used it for years Very good product</li>
</ol>
