<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved my hair! It is very easy and quick to dry my hair, and very comfortable! Besides durable, and I have some time with him and is like new! And I dry my hair two or three times a week! excellent</li>
    <li> First of all, it was a little heavy to handle. Second, I didn&#x27;t feel any effect from ionizing. And then this one broke after exact one year since the day of first use. I&#x27;m gonna be using different dryer this time.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice dryer - dries hair fast. I have curly hair so I wanted a defuser on the end.  The only negative comment I have is the dryer is heavy and a little unwieldy - not for the weak or little old ladies.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace a Revlon Quiet Ceramic model. I am a male with short, straight hair and a new ostomy which requires me to wear a large bandage-like appliance on my abdomen. I can shower with it on, but it takes some effort to get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon dryer was nice and quiet but didn&#x27;t have much air flow. This Conair has much more forceful flow without much more noise. It has three temperature settings - the hot and cool are okay, but I wish warm were a little warmer. I can dry my hair and appliance in about three minutes instead of five before. The weight is a little more than some dryers but nothing extreme; it feels sturdy. I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect of the ionizer button and haven&#x27;t tried the attachments.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever used! It works great on my thick, coarse hair &amp; I would not have picked any other dryer but this one!</li>
    <li> This dryer is not for people with small hands or problems with their wrist. It is very heavy, unbalanced and the handle is not hand-friendly. While I have no problems with the way this dryer dries, the its weight makes it very uncomfortable to use. I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry my hair, but even then I could feel the strain in my wrist. And it felt like when you were holding it, it kept wanting to fall forward, toward the nozzle, so that puts even more strain on the wrist. I don&#x27;t have wrist problems, but I imagine those that do would have an extremely uncomfortable time with this drier. A shame, as I like the settings and it does the drying job well.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried when I kept hearing how heavy this dryer is but it&#x27;s not as bad as one would think so don&#x27;t let that defer you in making a choice when it comes to a new hair dryer.  I wish I found this before I bought my other one...it&#x27;s quieter as well as it does a better blow dry without frizzes.  My hair feels more healthy instead of the &#x27;dried out&#x27; feel after drying.    I would highly recommend this tool and if you have a lot of other professional type tools - this will certainly be an asset to your collection.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice quality dryer for the money. I bought this dryer beacuse my old one was so loud it was making me deaf. This one is quiet. It reminds me of my hairdresser&#x27;s dryer. The diffuser is a bit small. I have alot of hair. Overall I would reccomend, but if you use alot of time drying your hair this may not be for you as it is heavy. If you have muscle, I would buy.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer had begun blowing the circuit breakers so I researched Amazon and a few other places before ordering this one. I am delighted with this hair dryer. Unlike some of the reviewers, I have short hair that is straight and fine. I use it on high for a fast dry, my hair feels soft and has no fly away static. I was afraid it would crowd my counter space, but I don&#x27;t find it too big or too heavy. I rarely accidently touch the cold button. I haven&#x27;t used the accessories. I&#x27;m very satified and appreciate the other reviewers comments that helped me decide on this one.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is a great find.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced, quiet, gentle and has more than adequate power for the thickest head of hair.  I like that its \\&quot;hot\\&quot; button is less hot than previous dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s time we stopped burning up our hair and scalp with \\&quot;hot\\&quot; settings that are not healthy for the hair or scalp.  My husband loves this dryer.  It has the gentle feature of not blowing hair all over the place and has 2 attachments for personal preference.  For me, if I were to list one drawback, it&#x27;s larger and heavier than my previous dryer.  I was use to a more compact dryer made by this manufacturer, that also had a \\&quot;fold up\\&quot; feature.  However, that \\&quot;fold up\\&quot; feature broke as did the plastic on the outside casing.  I am happy I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Three years and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer.  Yes as per other reviews it is heavier but it is so fast that I don&#x27;t have to hold it long so I don&#x27;t care.  It dries my hair in a few minutes and leaves it so soft and straight with absolutely no frizz.  I feel like I had it done at a salon.  I am very very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in October 2007 as a birthday gift for my mother.  Mom had been using the same ancient yellow hair dryer throughout my childhood and for as long as I could remember, at least 20 years.  That yellow one wasn&#x27;t a special hair dryer, my mom just doesn&#x27;t replace stuff unless it&#x27;s dead.  But by modern standards, that hair dryer was so out of date; it didn&#x27;t even have a cool air button and it smelled bad from all the loose strands of hair burning away inside.  My mother and I both have terrible, fine hair and I wanted to get my mom a high quality hair dryer, I bought this one because of the number of positive reviews.  When I bought this item in 2007 and looking back at my account history, I paid higher than the current list price, significantly more than Amazon&#x27;s price today.    Anyway, this hair dryer is still going great in 2011, having been regularly (if not daily) used by 2-5 family members and occasionally a dog.  And my 16-year old sister stole it out of moms bathroom so sister could use it every day in the privacy of her bedroom.  I just came home for a visit and happened to use it, unaware it was This hair dryer and thought that for some reason it felt better than any other hair dryer as I was using it, but also when I was done... I just had that feeling that I was having a great hair day.  Which is rare because my hair is terribly fine.  So I went back online to order a new one for myself and was very pleased with the current price.  Ordered immediately!     Ultimately, when reviewing or assessing an item, you have to think--knowing what I know now, would I buy this item again?  My answer is definitely yes.</li>
    <li> We purchased this hairdryer using Amazon Prime for $21.75 on July 20, 2010. This hair dryer is heavy, has only semi-warm heat, and has lackluster airflow. The \\&quot;cold air\\&quot; button is in such a position that it is hard to avoid accidentally pushing when changing from one hand to the other. It stopped working completely after only 7 months of \\&quot;light\\&quot; use!  Neither Conair nor Amazon would replace or give even a partial refund. Terrible Hair Dryer - Avoid!  We ordered the \\&quot;Vidal Sassoon VS547 Ion Select Full Size Dryer\\&quot; as a replacement.  It is MUCH lighter and hotter, so far a considerably better choice, not to mention it is cheaper too!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife and she loves it... is willing to go for the same product should she loose the one she has. She has used the hair-dryer for over 10 months now. Worth the 4 stars, at a minimum!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer saves so much time and leaves my hair silky and smooth.  I have wavy/thick hair and it cut the drying time in half.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this dryer for my mom but ended up trading my lighter blow dryer for this one. The Conair is quite heavy and it was too difficult for her to use because of her arthritis.   It works well but even for me, it is a bit bulky and heavy. If you spend lots of time in a blowdrying session, your arms will get pretty tired. Then again, you may end up with great biceps. :)</li>
    <li> This item has the the most positive reviews which encouraged me to buy it. But I negelected one very important point: it&#x27;s too big and too heavy! If you&#x27;re big and have very strong arm, this might be a good selection. Besides, I personally don&#x27;t think it very quiet as commented by other buyers. One good feature is that the cool air is very nice.</li>
    <li> The weight of the dryer isn&#x27;t a problem for me (mentioned as a factor in other reviews). I&#x27;m petite in size with long hair. It&#x27;s take me about 2-3 minutes to dry most of my hair since I don&#x27;t blowdry the ends. It&#x27;s sturdy, relatively quiet, and prevents frizziness. I&#x27;ve definitly noticed a healthier feel and texture to my hair. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase over my previous product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  It dries faster than most and does leave my hair softer than my previous blowdryer.  It takes a moment or two for it to heat up, but never gets so hot that it would burn me.  I love the two attachments and being able to complete 3 types of styles without a problem.  The only negative is (as others have mentioned) the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button.  It is not uncommon for fingers to rest on it while styling and then all my heat is gone.  It does need better usability testing.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is big and heavy but thankfully it dries hair pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my fine hair like other super hot dryers. I don&#x27;t have tons of thick hair so it works for me but people with long thick hair would also have tired arms.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but it works pretty good. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product. It does seem to take less time to dry my hair and it&#x27;s quiter than the other regular hair dryer that I have. However, the buttons are not in the great spot, I sometimes turn the dryer off without meaning to do so. It&#x27;s not a major problem, however.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer, while heavy, is a great product and works very well, actually wonderfully on my hair.  Love the finished look.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is wonderful. The heat settings are not hot and do not scorch your hair. Hair feels noticeably shinier and healthier after the first use. It is well worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Got this for myself a few months ago and my daughter liked mine so much that I got her one for Christmas...Very nice drier.  Great price through Amazon too....Sturdy, but not too heavy.  Gentle on hair. Great looking too.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using for three weeks now and have not had a single problem with the dryer.  It is nice that it is quieter than most dryers, but it is a bit heavier as well.  Works quickly.  Overall, for the price, a good buy.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave it a 4 is because i think it is a little bulky and heavy. Otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick, straight, blond hair. No other hairdryer compairs to this one. Similar looking Conair Infiniti hairdryers that come in pink and other colors, found in stores like Target, are inferior in every way. If you buy this one with the quiet, powerful, heavy, professional motor you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Hello I&#x27;m an autistic adult...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve never done a review on a hair dryer but I suppose there&#x27;s a first for everything.  Anyway&#x27;s this hair dryer work&#x27;s really nicely and does a good job of getting my hair dry.  That&#x27;s all I can really say about it because other than that I&#x27;m stumped on word&#x27;s for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great hair dryer and designed well buy it you&#x27;ll like it.  It will get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Hunting on finding a good hair dryer that suit&#x27;s your needs!</li>
    <li> The diffuser is great! It really gets curly/wavy hair looking nice and not flat and frizzy. I also love the other concentrator attachment.  I have not noticed that is takes longer, like some reviews say. It works great and it blows a lot of air, in my opinion.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> MoFarmer&#x27;s Wife:  This dryer&#x27;s heat isn&#x27;t nearly hot enough to dry thick, coarse hair.  It blows too hard, even on low speed.  The low speed doesn&#x27;t allow for styling while drying, blows my hair all over the place, and actually creates tangles when my hair is long enough.  I just bought a Chi to replace this one.  Hope I can sell it at consignment!</li>
    <li> Pros:  This dryer has wider selection options for speed and heat settings than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned.    Cons:  This dryer is heavy.  Ladies with long, slow-drying hair might think twice.  Their arm will get a workout.  The handle angle makes it very awkward and tiring to use.  The angle is completely opposite of what&#x27;s needed to dry your own hair.  I plan to replace it with another brand for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> i love it, it works great on my hair which is long, thick and wavy. it is a bit heavy but i don&#x27;t mind since it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit primarily out of concerns that my old hair dryer, which was EXTREMELY noisy (like many cheaper hair dryers), might eventually cause hearing loss.  I had noticed that higher end hair dryers, such as those used in hair salons, tended to be much quieter and would dry hair faster then the little $25 hair dryer I&#x27;d had for several years.  After a fair amount of online searching and reading of reviews, I settled on this model as the best reviewed model out there at a price I was comfortable with, and having the functionality I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am well pleased with my purchase.  The unit works exactly as advertised, is much, MUCH quieter than my old unit, and dries my hair far faster.  It worked fine right out of the box and has given me no problems in the several months I&#x27;ve been using it.  It also feels much more \\&quot;solid\\&quot; compared to my old unit, and is very comfortable to hold and use, even though it is somewhat heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that other reviewers have commented on the weight of the unit.  While it is heavier than many hair dryers, I did not find that weight to be excessive.  Also, the unit&#x27;s designers paid attention to ergonomics (as opposed to cool looks or keeping down manufacturing cost) and that focus has done alot to alleviate concerns that many will have about the weight: the unit is both easy to hold and well balanced, with well placed controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one negative - and it is very minor, is that the 7&#x27; power cord is - if anything - too long.  Many will appreciate a cord of this length; but in my situation (where the electrical outlet is low on the wall near the vanity) the cord tends to drag a bit on the floor. This can be annoying when it gets tangled around things or you step on it.  I suppose a rubber band would probably alleviate the concern, but have I found time to be bothered?  Nah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, a unit that clearly benefits from much effort being put into designing a product that is very ergonomic and solid.  Very definitely worthy of 5 stars!nitely worthy of 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave feedback for products but after reading other people&#x27;s reviews - which ultimately convinced me to buy this product--I thought I should, to be fair. Like many others who left feedback, I have very thick, long hair and bought this dryer in hopes of cutting down my drying time. Other reviews raved about hot powerful and hot this dryer was, but I don&#x27;t fully agree. My drying time was 45 minutes and is still about 30-35 minutes. I know there are other dryers out there that do the trick, but for me this wasn&#x27;t one of them. Also it is a pretty heavy device. If you don&#x27;t feel like dealing with something heavier than the norm, this might not be for you.    To be fair, this dryer seems very sturdy and looks like it will last a long time. The extra pieces clip on and stay on (another problem I&#x27;ve had in the past). This is probably a perfect product for people with normal to semi-thick hair, but for me, it just wasn&#x27;t something I would rave about.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  I borrowed one at a friend&#x27;s house for her wedding and I decided I had to have one..  All I knew was that it was called an Infiniti, so I had to guess on a model and hope I got the same kind they had.  I got lucky and it&#x27;s what I was hoping for.  It is SO fast... cuts my time in half.</li>
    <li> I just used my new Infiniti dryer this morning and I really do like it. It&#x27;s quieter than my previous one, yet powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. I straighten my hair, so I will be using the concentrator much more than the diffuser. It&#x27;s nice to have the cold option so I can give my hair a little blast at the end. Like some of the other reviewers noted, holding the handle can get a bit clumsy (my fingers slipped on the buttons a couple of times) and the dryer itself is heavy (I think the description says it&#x27;s just over three pounds). I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the weight, however. Also, this dryer catches anything in its path -- I had a couple of towels hanging in my bathroom and the dryer kept sucking them in! All in all, a very professional hair dryer at a budget price. Conair puts out the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair 213X Infiniti Pro Tourmaline Hair Dryer for quite awhile. As a guy with short-medium length hair, I always thought that hair dryers were all the same. But this dryer is great because I like the power at the high setting. It dries your hair faster than a lower powered dryer. The low setting is great for all uses.    The Conair 213X Infiniti is a little heavier compared to a basic ionic, so it may not be as easy to use if you&#x27;re taking a lot of time drying long hair. I think that it&#x27;s a bit expensive at around $45-$50, but I would highly recommend it under $40. The Conair 213X Infiniti Pro Tourmaline is a very good, solid hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer and styler for straight or curly hair.  [[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]</li>
    <li> After a $6 conair lasted me for years, i replaced it with a $20 revlon that was a piece of crap.  I vowed to research my next hairdryer online instead of picking randomly in the store and settled on this one.  I LOVE this hairdryer.  By far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, and the best diffuser I&#x27;ve ever used (curly haired girl, here).  There is a stark difference between hot, warm, and cold, too.  I should maybe buy a second just in case they ever discontinue this model...</li>
    <li> When I asked my hairdresser what&#x27;s the best (and not crazy expensive) hairdryer she could recommend for me, she said to make sure it said \\&quot;tourmaline,\\&quot; and that she&#x27;d heard the conair version is really good. After reading some of the Amazon reviews on various tourmaline hair dryers, I chose this one. And boy, does it make my hair look great! It comes out silky, shiny, smooth, and with good volume. How could I have gone for so long with that subpar blowdryer I&#x27;d been using, which took so long dry my hair, and left it sort of flat? Also, this Conair dryer isn&#x27;t too loud,  dries the hair quite fast, and has different settings you can experiment with. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did quite a lot of research before buying this hairdryer. I was debating between this and another product that was around $90...I&#x27;ve always used \\&quot;cheapie\\&quot; dryers from the drugstore, and when mine stopped working, I decided I needed an upgrade. The reviews seemed good and the price was right - so decision made.    First, let me say: Other reviewers have commented that this is unreasonably heavy. It is on the heavier side, but it&#x27;s not at all uncomfortable and it actually helps me to gauge where I&#x27;m aiming it.    Secondly, I don&#x27;t think this hairdryer gets very hot. This is a huge plus for me, because I have thin hair and I don&#x27;t think I could singe or burn my hair with this dryer. However, for someone with super thick hair, it might not do the job as well.    With my old dryer, it took me 20-30 minutes to dry my medium length hair. With this dryer, I&#x27;m dry and ready to go in 10 minutes or less, so that is a huge plus.    Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> Wow! Don&#x27;t be fooled by any negative reviews on this product. This hair dryer is wonderful! I research every product I buy before I make a purchase, making sure I&#x27;ll get the best quality for my money. This Dryer uses ionic, tourmaline and ceramic technology to give you the fastest and most healthy dry hair possible. It is the quietest dryer I have ever owned. I can hear my i pod in the background on the highest setting, which I was unable to with my old dryer. It dries my fine but long hair (past the middle of my back) in about 4 minutes! And afterwards my hair is smooth, shiny and sleek. But the most important thing is despite what several complainers have stated, this dryer is not heavy at all. I&#x27;m 4&#x27;11&#x27;&#x27; and 100 pounds, and this dryer is no problem for me at all. If you have a problem with the weight I suggest you go to wal-mart and purchase some 5 pound weights and build some much needed muscle!!! This Dryer is perfect and I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer online after my old Conair started failing (it had a long life).  Most of the reviews made this sound like a great replacement option.  While this dryer works perfectly well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that anyone purchase it because it is SO HEAVY.  I mean, ridiculously heavy for a blow dryer.  My hand and arm actually get tired after using it for just a few minutes.  I would have returned the dryer if it had been purchased at a local store--but repackaging it and going to the post office is a real pain.  My advice...look for something a little lighter.[[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer I have ever owned. I have long hair that is thick, and any other blow dryer takes twice as long. This is powerful and gets the job done. I&#x27;ve owned the blow dryer for 4 years and have used it at least 4 or 5 times a week since I bought it. I have never had any problems with it. It works as well today as when I bought it 4 years ago! It is WELL worth the money...and then some.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this dryer. I have curly hair (I never straighten it) and the diffuser that came with the dryer is terrible. Air still blows very hard through the diffuser and it blows my hair everywhere, creating a lot of frizz. I&#x27;ve ordered another diffuser to use with this dryer, so hopefully that will solve the problem.     Also it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other dryers and although I like that, I can see how that would be a problem for some people.</li>
    <li> Though I&#x27;d never purchased a blow-dryer for more than $20, my husband did some researching and came up with this being the best choice.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now, and I have to say I&#x27;m VERY pleased!! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.   Major points:  1) Using the focuser has given me excellent results. I&#x27;m very happy with the way my hair has been looking!  2) Heat is perfect - I have thinner hair than most, so the warm setting works really well for me. Though I do use the hot setting for my roots.  3) Some reviewers complained about the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button being in the way. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s pretty easy to avoid if you&#x27;re paying attention. :)  4) Some other reviewers complained about the weight. I think it&#x27;s just fine. If it&#x27;s too heavy for ya, then it can double as a work-out session too!    Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> LOVE this hairdryer, but the dryer is somewhat heavy.  The buttons are also a bit fickle.      Otherwise, a great dryer!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a more expensive hair dryer that did not last more than one year. Although it does work well, it takes longer than expected to dry my hair. High wattage, but not a lot of output. Hair is shiny and soft when done, but 2 negatives about this dryer... 1) power cord about 6-12\\&quot; too short for my bathroom use; and 2) this dryer is not weighted properly.  The drying nozzle is too long and heavy for the size of the handle. If you can feel it before buying you might change your mind. It is still a pretty decent dryer, but I am not sure I would have bought it having held it in my hands. Bought it based on other reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. My old one was frying my hair and took FOREVER to finish the job at that. This one dries my long, thick hair that used to take 15+ minutes in about 6! I think it&#x27;s a great dryer for the money. It is a little heavier than my last one, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;d recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> My old hairdryer was burning my hair and making it frizzy, not to mention taking about 45 minutes to dry my hair.  This dryer does it in half the time with no frizz.  It has hot, warm, and cold settings - I love this.  It is a great buy for the technology behind it.  It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer based on a magazine article which had rated it very highly.  My first ion dryer had broken (not a Conair), so I was anxious to replace it.    First of all, this dryer does absolutely nothing to prevent or lessen the \\&quot;frizzies.\\&quot;  Even when I used Frizzease serum first, my hair looks like a fuzz ball after a few minutes.    Secondly, I usually hold the dryer with my right hand and a brush with my left.  I found the on/off button extremely difficult to slide one-handed, something I&#x27;ve never had trouble with with other dryers.  Also, if I hold the dryer where I usually would, I accidentally squeeze the blue \\&quot;cool air\\&quot; button.    Finally, I find this dryer to be very heavy to hold and manipulate.  I&#x27;ve purchased other travel dryers for $9.99 and they do a better job than this one for over $30.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer to replace a hairdryer I had gotten free from my mother (nothing special).  For my prior hairdryer I used a attachable diffuser that cost $5 from the beauty supply store.  Sadly, it seems that purchase was better as this item is heavy and has short diffuser fingers.  Based on the other reviews I thought I would see great results for my long, curly hair.  Instead it ends of frizzy.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is very reasonably priced and lasted five years, which I thought would be a great thing considering there was a five year warranty on it. I called politely and received a quiz of questions faster than I could answer. When I finally hiccuped on a question and said I didn&#x27;t know, I was firmly told that it was the necessary info required for the warranty validation and promptly hung up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wracked my brain and came up with &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34; info and recalled, waited through 20 more minutes of muzak, before someone answered and after hearing my explanation, told me that the info i was told was required for the warranty, actually unqualified me for it!?! I asked to speak to someone higher up and was put on muzak hell for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now am a proud owner of a NUME hairdryer and warn anyone against purchasing a product from a company that shows such blatant disdain for it&#x27;s customers.</li>
    <li> FYI, Costco selling this for 19.99    But overall, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I received the Conair hair diffuser and I am exceptionally pleased with the quality of this product.  I have seen this in stores near where I reside priced 10 to $15 higher.  I am so glad that Amazon.com offers such top merchandise at realistic prices.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer 3 months ago and I absolutely LOVE IT! It dries so much quicker then my old Conair and it is a lot quieter too. I have long thick curly hair that I blow dry straight 6 days a week. This dryer keeps my hair looking fresh, healthy and never frizzy. It is a little heavier then some other dryers but you get used to the weight pretty quickly. Plus since it cut my drying time in half I can&#x27;t really complain. So, if you are on the fence about this one, just go for it.</li>
    <li> This dryer worked well enough for the price, but it died 2 years after purchasing it. It simply won&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my wife bought a cheap, fancy hair dryer.  What a disaster.  This is a top of the line hair dryer.  Well made, very quiet, but good air flow and very controlled heat.  I also like the fact that it has a removable filter so that the lint can be cleaned off easily before burning up the motor.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last couple of weeks and I am definitely pleased with it. It cut my hair drying time by half, even though it doesn&#x27;t heat as much. I love the fact that it comes with both the diffuser and the concentrator attachment and the fact that the cool air button really blows cold air, not lukewarm. It is heavier than my old hair dryer but nothing to complain about. One complaint I can think of is the fact that the accessories really heat when in use (reason i deducted a star). So be careful when removing them. Other than that, it is a great styler.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length curly hair, and this diffuser has been a lifesaver for me! It is quite solid and yes, the controls seem to be a bit awkward at first, but, nonetheless, it does the job as intended. You can control the amount of heat whether it&#x27;s on low, high, or no heat, which is another plus. Overall, I am very satisfied with my diffuser and I would recommend this to anyone, plus the price is good and I compared other so-called better diffusers, but this one won out. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be as noisy as her other one.  It is a bit quieter but not enough to make it worth while from that aspect.</li>
    <li> I think that this hair dryer will do the trick.  As per another reviewer, it does seem a little heavy, which may be a problem for some users.</li>
    <li> I had a CONAIR dryer for nine years and it&#x27;s finally on its last legs. Got this one after reading the rave reviews. It&#x27;s quiet, and it dries fast. But if you have even a smidgen of product on your hands, forget trying to operate the controls. I have almost resorted to using my teeth! Very weird, because everything else about this dryer is very good. Oh, and one more thing. Would it have killed them to add a retractable cord?</li>
    <li> Have been using this hair dryer now for the past 6 months and really like the power and drying time. My daughter and I have very thick, long hair and this dryer does the job. My hair still needs to be flat ironed when done drying but the dryer really helps smooth it out.</li>
    <li> This dryer seemed a little heavy at first, but this unit is not a toy and should last a long time.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer works great! It&#x27;s not that loud and it dries my hair rather quickly. It&#x27;s sorta heavy but you get used to the weight which isn&#x27;t too bad. Also where I tend to hold the dryer is where they put the cool button so I sometimes end up pressing it while drying, but that&#x27;s a minor flaw :) I would still recommend it to anyone, best blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> this hair blow dryer is good, but the conair that i had before (which died on me), was much hotter, which i LOVED. this one is great with the attachments because i use them and i didn&#x27;t have them before, so that is a great bonus. however, i miss the heat. the drying time seems to be about the same. but my hair does seem softer. so less heat, probably is better for my hair!  so who knows, maybe i&#x27;ll grow to LOVE this one. and then it will die on me......</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m a dude and I have short hair, so for many years I didn&#x27;t think I needed to spend much mental effort in acquiring a \\&quot;hairdryer\\&quot;.   Times have changed.   This is a fantastic product that I wholeheartedly recommend. I finally decided to stop picking up a cheezy $20 hairdryer every couple of years from walmart or target, and decided to get a quality product. Unlike most times I have tried to take a similar approach to a \\&quot;common\\&quot; household product, this purchase is an epic success. For not that much more money than I usually would spend, the *Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler* is simply amazing. I use it to dry my whole body of residual moisture after toweling off, to dry errant globs of still-wet antiperspirant under my arms, and to generally just dry stuff all over the house whenever I need it.  I don&#x27;t consider it just a \\&quot;hairdryer\\&quot;, it is instead my go-to forced-air device for many many uses.  It incorporates the latest technologies I was seeking (ceramic element and ion-generation) and is robust, sleek and elegant. I rarely use the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting, it dries everything just fine on either just \\&quot;warm\\&quot; or even \\&quot;cool\\&quot;.  The only drawback I could imagine for others, although this doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, is that it is kinda weighty and hefty relative to hairdryers I have had in the past... if someone were looking for a light and insubstantial dryer that fits neatly on the counter, this is not that item.  srsly. luv it.  [Update: This came in handy when a cup of water spilled amongst electronics. I quickly sprung into action by blotting up excess water, spritzing the entire area with neat isopropanol and then using the Conair 213XP Infiniti to get rid of residual water by forming an azeotrope with the isopropanol. Awesome dryer tool]</li>
    <li> I have owned this dryer since around 2005. i have taken it to 6 different countries, I even fried it in China, or thought I had. I couldn&#x27;t bear to throw it away, so I held on to it, brought it home, and it worked again! Just yesterday, May 2011, it finally died. I love this dryer, and while it&#x27;s big, it really worked!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a broken Sasoon hair dryer which was purchased at a drug store. I love this dyer: drys quickly, comes with an attachment for when you want straight hair, and another for drying curly hair. It&#x27;s not all that heavy, and I have not found this to be a problem. It&#x27;s a solid unit that will hopefully last for a few years. Leaves hair shiny-er than non-ionic dryers. Cons: A little too big to travel with in your carry-on. If you&#x27;re looking for a new hair dryer to use at home, you should buy this one.</li>
    <li> this blow dryer is really really realllllllllllllyyy good. i didnt expect it at all for the price too. i just needed one to use before i flat iron my hair and wow..i hardly needed to use my flat iron. my hair was that straight. buy it! o it is a tad heavy as other pple have said. but if they didnt comment on it i wouldnt have noticed...and im not that strong. grrrrrreeeattt producttt!!!..</li>
    <li> For the price, the control buttons (hot, warm, low, high) should be better made, and easier to use. They are very hard to press with one hand, which is what you need with a blow dryer. Plus, it was heavier than I expected. We returned it.</li>
    <li> This Conair Infiniti hairdryer is the best.  I can dry my long hair in 5 minutes using high speed without the hairdryer automatically shutdown.  My old hairdryers always gets very hot &amp; automatically shutdown when using high speed and would have to wait till the hairdryers cool off before I can use them again. In the past, I bought a professional hairdryer for $90.  This hairdryer does a better job and cost less.  After blow drying, my long hair comes out shiny, smooth &amp; has body without putting any hair products on it. I highly recommend this Conair Infiniti hairdryer.</li>
    <li> My wife liked the hair dryer when she read about it on amazon. I surprised her with this and a straightener she liked for her birthday. She said the dryer is great, and if she needed to buy another at a later date, that she wants the same one.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is pretty powerful yet quiet. It dries my hair super fast on the hot setting. And I have thick hair. The attachments that come with it are very useful. The only thing I wish it had is a retractable cord.</li>
    <li> Stop reading reviews and buy this dryer! I spent a lot of time researching hair dryers after my 10 year old dryer stopped working. This unit fits in your hand and balances perfectly, reducing arm fatigue, and the speed/heat settings are perfect. No frizz hair, it&#x27;s fast, and I never thought I&#x27;d be this excited about a hair dryer. I use it every single day and what a joy.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this dryer and many others before making my purchase.  I thought about getting a hand-held styler by Conair, but based on the reviews it wasn&#x27;t as great as this dryer even though both were similar.  I&#x27;ve been using this dryer about a week now and replaced my old Conair that I got at Walmart that was going out.  This one was quite a bit heavier in weight, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It dries more quickly than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever had and makes my hair shiny.  I like the attachments and the cold shot, but my dryer before had those as well even though it was a much cheaper version of the Ion dryer.  I am very pleased with the purchase and am glad I went with another hair dryer instead of something else.  I&#x27;ve used Conair dryers and hot rollers for the past ten years and think they are better than any of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.  This one is the best one I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> no fuss, no muss.  pleasure to do business with. arrived on time as indicated. works well. no complaints to date.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quiet hair blow dryer compared to other typical ones out there. But, the only problem is that it is heavier than most of the dryers. Other than that, this is a good blow dryer. With this Conair 213XP, I only need about 5 mins to dry my hair and I have long hair. My hair&#x27;s length is almost reached my elbows. Worth a try of this product.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time this morning, and I am thoroughly impressed!  My old hairdryer was giving me problems (Wigo - paid $100 for it) and I found this one on Amazon. I cannot believe how much better it is than my old one!  My hair is softer and shinier, and dried very quick!  I wouldn&#x27;t bother with spending the $ on T3 - this is an incredible dryer for the price!</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryier it makes my hair look so pretty and silky. Im really satisfied with my purshase.....not only this but it dries my hair faster than my old one. Really a good buy!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.. unfortunatly the way the controls are placed on the handle, I freqently shut it off or change it to a colder setting.</li>
    <li> It is a little heavy but also a very good quality product....no problems so far everything works very well...For the price you would pay alot more for this type of hair dryer...a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hairdryer.  It&#x27;s much quieter than my old Conair hairdryer that&#x27;s about 5 years old.  Also, it dries my hair much faster and tames the frizzies.  I have thick wavy hair that takes forever to dry.  I live in a humid climate, so trying to keep the frizzies under control is very important.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is much smoother using this dryer versus the non-ion hair dryers.  My only complaint is the weight...it&#x27;s a bit heaver than my old drier...good thing it dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for home use to replace my Ionic styler. However, this product is very heavy and difficult for me to handle. I will use it, but do not enjoy it fully. It is very clumsy and if you have difficulty with your arms, shoulder or hands it is not for you.</li>
    <li> Works really great..a bit heavier than my previous hairdryer but definately dries fast!!  and makes my hair straight......  supposedly had a code for a free $6 brush with product but never could get the code to be accepted...BEST NOT TO OFFER EXTRAS THAT DON&#x27;T COME WITH PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that this thing is a bit on the hefty side, and that stupid cold button really needs to be moved.... but I still love this hairdrier.     It dries my hair much faster and with less heat than my old drier, and the extra attachments were a definate plus. My hair is slightly less frizzy, but I would still put in defrizz unless I&#x27;m going to flat iron it. The price is the real seller... I simply refuse to pay over $100 to blow hot air on myself, so this drier was both resonably priced and worked great!</li>
    <li> This is a great affordable dryer. I decided to purchase this dryer because I wanted one that is ionic with tourmaline technology, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay $[...] for a T3 dryer at Sephora. My old Conair Ion Shine 165R promised to give me shiny hair, but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one (could have been the fact that my Ion Shine is now 5 years old and is on it&#x27;s way out.) When I use the Conair Infiniti 213X with the ion switch turned on and the concentrator attachment, my hair comes out super shiny and straight. I don&#x27;t even have to use my straightening iron afterwards. This dryer is a bargain, especially since I get the same results as I would with much more expensive dryers. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i have had this for over a year now.... nice item, drys quickly, but it is heavier than any other that i have owned.</li>
    <li> This has been the first inexpensive blowdryer I have purchased in....years. My high end blowdryer died so I began shopping around to find a new blowdryer. The reviews for the conair were so good that I thought I should give it a shot. It was also so inexpensive. When I got it I expected it to perform the same way my professional dryers did. That&#x27;s not the case. First, it&#x27;s VERY heavy! Also, It doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as well as the other brands. Finally, it doesn&#x27;t give you as many heating options. For example, high / low, hot/warm/cold. By the way, the hot setting is far from it. So, in my perspective it&#x27;s actually an expensive blowdryer because if you have to replace it with something better and lighter then it&#x27;s just wasted money!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length \\&quot;ringlet-ty\\&quot; curls and always use a diffuser. I liked the pricing of this model and the fact that it would speed up drying time, reduce noise plus it came with a diffuser. What I did not know was how horrendously designed the diffuser is. It is not much better than just plain aiming the the nozzle of the dryer at your hair. It is not designed to diffuse at all, so even at the lowest setting it will make your hair frizz. I tried to use my old (and wonderful)diffuser on this dryer but it would not adapt. The Conair diffuser is full of large holes in the center which defeats the purpose of diffusing. Air is still being forced out directly onto the hair which succeeds in buffeting your curls around and frizzing them up. It is also not deep enough to cup and scrunch your curls and give them lift as they dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others said, this is very heavy and awkward to use, the cord is as thick as something you&#x27;d find on an industrial grade tool and this appliance does not really dry the hair any faster nor it did not make my hair the least bit shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final verdict? What a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Really great value for money, good settings, cold, warm, hot, high, low. Everything you want from a hair dryer. Bit on the heavy side, but that&#x27;s normal for a good dryer. Leaves my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
    <li> It drys my hair fast, it&#x27;s about the same weight as my old blow dryer but since I have less drying time, the weight is no problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year. When I started using it, I noticed the differences between this new hair dryer and the old traditional dryer. My hair felt really soft after using this hair dryer. My hair didn&#x27;t shine at the beginning, but after using it for a while, when my friends looked at my pictures, they all said my hair looked really, really shinning. Also every one of my girl friends who had stayed at my place for couple nights asked me where to get this, &#x27;cause their hair felt so soft after using it. Recently I just found out the Iron bottom in the back. I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t find it on the instruction book. When I turned it on, I can style my hair (straight) much quicker... I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty heavy dryer but I&#x27;m used to it - the one I am replacing is also heavy. My only other minor complaint is that the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting is pretty cool.  I know that is better for the hair but sometimes I like the feel of hot air or being able to adjust the temperature more.    The pluses - quicker drying time and MUCH smoother hair - even outside in heat and humidity. Small disclaimer - I use this dryer in combination with CHI silk infusion before I dry my hair and to smooth after I straight iron.  That could be part of it. However, I have done that with another ionic dryer and did not get nearly as good of a result as I have gotten with this dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair is VERY thick and long, and requires a lot of maintenance. It is naturally wavy, but I find it to be more manageable when I straighten it - so I do so every time I wash it. I needed a hair drier that I could use to straighten my hair effectively as I dry it. Sounds easy, but I have tried many different hair driers and none have the power to keep my hair straight that way. This conair 213X Infiniti does the job well. When I straighten my hair with it as I dry it, I barely need to use my hair straightener afterwards - and it will stay straight until the next time I wash it. The only downside is it is still too heavy for me to hold long enough to do my hair, so my wonderful husband often gets roped into helping me.</li>
    <li> When my old blow dryer bit the dust I thought I was going to have to pay some outrageous price to get a decent dryer. This product meet my expectations and then some. Given my previous dryer was a Brookstone Travel hair dryer, so it didn&#x27;t have all that many features, but it was compact and lasted me a good 6-7 yrs. Anyway, I love all the different heat settings, and it leaves my hair feeling a lot lighter than I&#x27;m used to. On the downside, it&#x27;s rather heavy (though again, I&#x27;m switching from a little travel hair dryer), I sort of feel like I have to grow some extra muscles in my hands for this thing.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a great value for the price! motor is not loud and the heat temp is perfect for me...I totally recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer purchase so far.  Dries fast, makes hair silky and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Only negative is that the dryer is on the heavy side... Still a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have thin, naturally frizzy hair that is cut just below my shoulders.  I use mousse and a diffuser to style it curly.  After reading the reviews I had great hopes for a frizz-free mane.  Unfortunately, that hasn&#x27;t been the case.  It&#x27;s no worse than with any other hairdryer, but no better either.      Although the hairdryer is heavier than others I have had, I don&#x27;t find it too heavy.  If you do any kind of weightlifting, or any other exercise or sport that requires arm strength, you&#x27;ll be fine.      For curly-haired shoppers: the one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the diffuser that came with this hairdryer.  The little fingers are too hard and short.  My old diffuer with longer, softer fingers gave me better control over my curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Conair Yellowbird.  For me, I need the air, not heat.  It does not produce as much forced air as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer and for a good price.  It is as some other reviewers have said, heavy.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just used to lighter dryers, but this one makes my arm tired.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer about 1 yr ago and am extremely happy with it. Prior to this dryer, I had a Conair CP2675, which is my all time favorite...until it stopped working!! I couldn&#x27;t find it in stock anywhere so I decided to try the 213X. I am really picky when it comes to hair dryers since I have really thick and curly hair but it leaves my hair soft and silky, and never frizzes my hair so there are no complaints from me. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Everything works as expected, however i wish more thought were put into the design of the dials. They arent quite grippy enough especially if your fingers are moist i.e. after you lotion up. Anyway it has been 4 years and is still as reliable as it was on day one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing.....I finally had to throw out my 1675 Watt Vidal Sassoon hair dryer after what seems like 100 years!  My long, fine hair always seemed a little frazzled, but I just thought I never had the nicest hair.  I researched many dryers and finally decided on the Conair Infinity....what a great choice.  My hair is SO SOFT and my broken hairs (have many cause I had LOTS of breakage with a creme Henna I used a few months ago) are definitely smoothed down...not as noticable as before.  I highly recommend this dryer....it&#x27;s really not that heavy, I&#x27;m strong but not Hercules!!  Low amount of noise and has a real professional feel!  Some reviewers complained about the location of the controls....I don&#x27;t find it to be troubling at all!  If it&#x27;s taking you a long time to decide which to buy....get this!  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could be that disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> I wish I would have acted on this hairdryer and returned it.  It is heavy and not easy to use because of that.  I&#x27;m always pushing the blue cool air button which is right where you hold the hairdryer.  The contols are hard to manuever, sometimes having to use both hands. It took me a while to realize I wasn&#x27;t getting used to the feel of the hairdryer.  I think it is a good hairdryer but for me, that doesn&#x27;t matter if I can&#x27;t handle it well.</li>
    <li> Dries hair quickly. Hair feels good. But its heavy and the switch is difficult to use. Sometimes I have a hard time turning it on. But its still worth buying because its a good dryer and a good price.</li>
    <li> I have only used this hair dryer a few times, but I am falling in love with it! I love how quickly it dries my hair and leaves it so soft. My boyfriend keeps touching my hair because of the softness! I only noticed how heavy the hair dryer was the first time I used it, and since then it hasn&#x27;t phased me. The hair dryer seems heavy duty, and I hope it lasts as long, if not longer than my previous hair dryer, which lasted me over 5 years. Although this is a great product, I do have some issues with it, which is why I am giving it 4 stars. Whenever I am using the warm setting, I am worried that I am going to slide the temperature switch to a different setting, so I have to consciously be aware of how I am holding the hair dryer. I wish the switch was made differently. Also, I don&#x27;t like the diffuser. I feel like it&#x27;s rather cheap compared to the diffuser that came with my previous Conair Ion Shine 1875W. The fingers are all plastic and it is flat across, as opposed to having a bowl like the other diffuser. The good thing for me is that I rarely diffuse my hair. Overall, it is a great hair dryer. I get all my hair dried in half the time! I used to give up and leave some of my hair damp, because it took so long to blow dry, but that&#x27;s not the case anymore! Conair has yet to disappoint me!  UPDATE May 2015: My hair dryer has finally stopped working. After lasting six years, I really can&#x27;t complain. I started using a the Jilbere Titanium Tools 2000W Cubic Print Dryer. I&#x27;m not completely won over by it yet. I feel like the Conair made my hair softer.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this blow dryer was able to straighten it better than my ceramic hair straightener. The diffuser works great when you don&#x27;t have time to air dry. It&#x27;s a bit heavy but you can tell that this hair dryer is made well. I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet but if I did I swear it would punch a hole through my floor and still be workable.</li>
    <li> Best choice !! 10 out of 10. U&#x27;ll never regret...  It can be used for straightening.....Love this product. Will surely recommend this product.....</li>
    <li> Somehow my first review was lost... so I will recapitulate. This is a professional styler with lots of air and heat. A bit heavy with a long cord. Kinda was a professional wants. Well, this is the the \\&quot;Tim the Toolman\\&quot; dryer. Perhaps over the top for me, but it&#x27;s very nice. I am not sure how much more to add not knowing the nuance of styling. I wanted to not spend a lot of time in the morning, and this makes it possible. But it&#x27;s not a wind tunnel. It just works. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A bit heavy, but I am not lifting it all day long. It simply does the job quickly and efficiently. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> I was using 20 years old hair dryer and I need to dry my 2 daughter&#x27;s hair quite often. So I decided to buy one which lots of people recommended this..  but this is very very heavy dryer!! I thought my wrist will be twisted after drying 2 daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> My hair dryer died, had to get a new one.  Read the reviews, and was hoping for a product that lived up to my old hair dryer that I really liked.  This product far exceeded my expectations.  Hair dried quicker, the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as hot as my previous hair dryer, and yet it still worked great.  Hair feels softer, and sets differently.  Never expected that a mid-range hair dryer could make such a difference!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  I have very thick wavy hair that has a tendency to frizz.  This dryer cut my drying time in half and really cuts down on my frizz.  It also dries my hair straighter than most dryers.  I still flat iron it afterwards but I feel like the texture of my hair has improved b/c of this dryer.  It feels much softer and I have a lot less breakage.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was worth the price.  It dries my hair quicker than any other dryer and with much less frizz.  The long cord has been great for drying my dogs after a bath in the winter.  We even tested the drying difference between this dryer and a basic Conair on our double-coat Aussies, this dryer cut the time in half (huge benefit with dogs and late mornings!).  After a few uses, it was easy to avoid hitting the cold-air button and others.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before ordering this and the biggest complaint I read was how heavy it is.  While it is heavier than my last dryer, I&#x27;m ok with it.  I actually consider it my arm workout for the day.  Honestly, if there was one thing to possibly improve it, it would be make it hotter.  However, even at what seems to be a lower temperature it seems to dry my hair rather quickly.  And probably with less damage to my hair.  So all in all, it was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I did use Sharper Image Ionic conditioning blow dryer for 3yrs. It was quiet and had a large mouth. THis one blew my hair all over the place.My hair is past bra strap lenghth, and it would have taken years to dry it. It was not hot enough for me and in addition to blowing it everywhere. I might still use it for the attachment for curly hair... which i have. If I could i would return it... and I AM a product junkie... however I am fair. I only used it once with out any attachments. If i find that i do like it later down the road... i will repost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s abnormally heavy and hard to turn on and off if your hands are damp from your hair or have hair product on them. It over all works well, I&#x27;ve had it for two years and no problems, but adds a lot of weight to suitcases and my arm gets tired holding it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the end of March and it burned out yesterday. I do not use it everyday, only a few times a week.I was drying my hair, and then I smelled a burning smell, and it stopped working. It will not turn back on again. It lasted less than 3 months. Very expensive for an appliance that only lasts a couple of months!</li>
    <li> This dryer is HEAVY, hard to turn on/off--I know that sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s true-- does absolutely NOTHING to reduce frizz, and doesn&#x27;t seem to blow very hard or have much heat.  Used it twice and am now shopping again for a new one.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas of 2007. It is still working like new for me 2 1/2 years later. This blow dryer is powerful and does a good job drying my thick hair. I use it on the medium heat setting and that is plenty of heat to get my hair dry without feeling like my head is burning. The cool option works well also.    The blow dryer is heavier than most other hair dryers I have used, but I have gotten used to it now and I don&#x27;t mind it.     I did have a scare with this dryer about a year after I got it. It kept turning off on me and I thought it was a goner. However, I pulled off the lint trap on the back of the dryer and cleaned out all of the lint and fuzz then put the screen back on. After that it worked like a charm. I have never had any other issues with it.</li>
    <li> The dryer is heavier than one you can get in a CVS, department or electronics store; however, it is well worth the little extra weight.  My hair dries quickly, is smooth to the touch and shiny.  Not bad for a 55 year old. I have had professional Conair dryers before and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Conair and their dryers.  My last Conair dryer (Ion Shine) was with me for over a decade before I ended up accidentally damaging the cord.  This dryer works excellent and unlike many other reviewers I didn&#x27;t find it too heavy.  Though I don&#x27;t use the attachments on a regular basis they do fit snugly and are not prone to fall off during use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for a few years now. It dries my hair quickly, the cold button is great, and my hair is always smooth after I use it (believe me, I can tell the difference when I&#x27;ve used a hotel blow dryer). The long cord is VERY nice, as is the concentrator.     I have fine hair but recently had a visitor with very long, very thick hair. She asked to borrow my blow dyer and asked me where I got it. We immediately went out so she could buy one for herself.     I&#x27;m buying another one before Conair decides to stop making it any more. I&#x27;ve had no problems with my current one so it could last many more years, but I want to be sure I have a replacement when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I doudt  that you can buy a better hand held dryer at any price.  Dont let your ego fool you into thinking if it costs more its better.....lol that a PT Barnum ploy......Buy it and enjoy.... it will be around for a long long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great styler.  Works faster than the older Conair models and is very powerful.  Wife has cut down her hair drying time by 20 minutes with this baby, and as a big bonus, it&#x27;s very quiet compared to other stylers.  There&#x27;s also a noticeable difference in the look and feel of her hair  The only thing is that it&#x27;s a bit heavier than her old styler (a 1850W conair, I&#x27;m guessing the tourmaline makes this one a tad heavier), but it&#x27;s not too bad, it&#x27;s a matter of getting used to the styler&#x27;s weight.  Your arm will adapt.  The attachments are sturdy and very convenient.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this hair dryer.  It dries my hair faster than other hair dryers that I have had and it is quieter (and I use the diffuser attachment, which is hopefully less damaging to my hair).  It leaves my hair feeling very soft.  It is a good hair dryer for the price -- I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Since I have combination hair (curly in the back and straight in the front, with a good deal of body), I have always styled my hair with results that were far from satisfactory.  Every time I made the effort, I ended up with a (somewhat) straight, frizzy look. I was using a $10 blow dryer thinking \\&quot;what&#x27;s the difference?\\&quot;  Recently, a colleague told me about the combination of a ceramic brush and the ionic dryer. I am amazaed at the results I have gotten from this blow dryer.  Literally, salon results.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times since using this dryer someone has asked me if I have just been to the hair dresser.  The amount of time it takes me to dry my somewhat thick hair has been reduced by at least half.  I am currently using no products, and I am still getting amazing results. Also, I have used the diffuser and I am very impressed with the results.  With no products it gives my sort of curly hair the extra boost it needs and maintains the look through the day.  I would not recommend this dryer to someone who has straight hair and no body (like my sister).  My only question is, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t my stylist tell me about this?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that likes to hold onto moisture. So this dryer is perfect for me. I can dry and style my hair relatively fast. It works great!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A BIT HEAVY. THE POWER TO DRY IS THERE. STORING IT IS A BIT ANNOYING. CORD IS NOT RETRACTABLE. IT DOES GET YOUR HAIR DRY FAST. IT EVEN DRYS NAIL POLISH NICELY ON COOL.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It dries my hair somewhat faster, but the biggest difference is that it leaves it so much smoother than a dryer without the tourmaline technology does.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s pretty large and heavy.</li>
    <li> I have medium to long length hair and this hairdryer dries my hair pretty quickly.  I have had a hair drying in the past that dried it a little faster but I paid more for it.  This maybe adds 30-45 seconds to my drying time so I would still rate it as very good.  My hair does not have a lot of flyaways or static to it with this dryer either.  Wouldn&#x27;t say it is super smooth, but I&#x27;ve been using it during a humid season so it&#x27;s hard to say.  I would recommend it and I&#x27;d most likely buy it again if I had to replace it.  I do like it much better than my daughter&#x27;s Bed Head hair dryer she has.  That one is super heavy and doesn&#x27;t dry quickly at all.</li>
    <li> Great Dryer for the price! Is a little heavy but I expected that from the other reviews.  Nice long cord.  I seem to hit the buttons on the handle (on and off and heat buttons) when drying but nothing that would stop me from buying this dryer again.</li>
    <li> Super hair dryer, the only thing negative I&#x27;ve found is the weight of the dryer.    It was a little bit heavy on hand but other than that it works really fine</li>
    <li> I really like it because I noticed it is quieter (when on \\&quot;high\\&quot;) than my previous one I bought a year ago.  My last one was an Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic hair dryer, and that one broke after a year.  It also dries hair pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I have gone through quite a number of hair dryers over the years, some good, some so-so, and others were, dare I use the word \\&quot;yucky?\\&quot; (I had another word to use there, but did not want to go around and around with the Amazon censers).  Several of these dryers cost well over a hundred dollars.  I can honestly say that I have been happier with this one than any of the others; event he more expensive models.  I have had this Conair 213X Infiniti for over a year now and it has never missed a beat.  It has been used on a daily basis, sometimes up to three and four times a day as I have quite a number of last minute sleepovers.  It gets rave reviews from all who use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two speeds are wonderful, and yes, you can actually tell the difference in the two, unlike so many I have tried.  The cord is long enough, a fault I have found in many and it is light enough that it does not give your arm a full course in weight training every time you use it. Now I will admit that I work out with weights constantly, so perhaps I am a poor judge as to the weight of this thing.  I have to admit that I have two of these wonderful little machines; keeping one in my locker at my club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not into wasting a lot of time, simply because with my life I do not have all that much to spare, and this unit dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is also quite useful in drying my watercolors, softening up cold butter, drying my nail polish on my toes, teasing the cat and dog (they are terrified of it), unthawing the little tube on the ice making machine on the fridge, and melting your big, oh so judgmental sister&#x27;s lipstick when the little pig leaves her stuff all over your bathroom counter when you are nice enough to let her crash at your place in the middle of the night with no warning what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and at the price, even if it goes croakers tomorrow, I have already gotten my monies worth and will certainly buy another.</li>
    <li> The price was a little costly, but after seeing so many rave reviews over this particular model I decided to give it a try back in early April of &#x27;10. Well I&#x27;ve been using it religiously every morning after my shower and I haven&#x27;t gone back since. This hair-dryer is top of the line, and the rave reviews are not all just fluff - the air is just warm enough, almost cool, to be able to get my hair fully dry in just under 15 minutes with enough time to get my hairstyle the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair-dryer also comes with two wonderful attachments, the diffuser and the concentration cone. The diffuser is great for getting that wavy texture for special occasions and can even go curly if you&#x27;re looking to put one of those fun hanging-bangs. The concentrator is great if you&#x27;re in a rush to get out and cuts the total time down to an easy 6-7 minutes - your hair will still be a little damp, but it&#x27;s really not too bad at all. A very small issue I had with the hair-dryer initially is that it was a bit cumbersome the first few times I used it - it&#x27;s rather large with a bit of heft, but after about two weeks I hardly noticed it at all. In fact, I felt like my arm had become a little bit stronger (not by much mind you - but every little bit counts!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have to say my experience and satisfaction with this product has been nothing less than wonderful. The only problem with using this hair-dryer is that it &gt;will&amp;lt; spoil you, and using anything less will be bothersome and very noticeable. I always keep a spare in my car now, and even better is that once you have it there long enough, you&#x27;ll find that its uses go far beyond just hair. You&#x27;d be surprised the sort of things you&#x27;d need to get dry on a bad day!</li>
    <li> I am not a great fan of haridryers for the fact that my hair normally gets tangled in the works; drying effect on both hair and scalp. After reading the reviews here, I decided to splash out and incredibly, my hair feels and looks shiney and definately did not dry my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the drying time was a lot quicker than I have experienced with other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like other reviews, this dryer is heavy and when you add the diffuser - I found it a little difficult to use.  I am glad my hair is short as holding this dryer for any more than 4 minutes would not be fun.</li>
    <li> It takes less time to me to dry my hair.  Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I just used the hairdryer for the first time this morning. I&#x27;m not 100% sure it dried my hair faster but it did seem to make it glossier. I was using a CVS travel hair dryer for 3 years before this one so obviously it was an upgrade and I am no expert on hairdryers. It was a bit heavier than I&#x27;m used to and not as easy to switch on and off with the flick of a thumb but overall it seems to be doing a good job. Normally I use a boar bristle brush to add gloss to my hair but this dryer made it look good without even using that brush.</li>
    <li> Ive had this unit and been using regularly for about 2 years. It is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the attachments- so I cannot comment on them.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a hair dryer that I could use on my hair and my children&#x27;s hair. Finally I have found one that works for both. It is hot enough to straighten my hair but does not burn it and has a cool setting that it safe to use on my children, who hate to have their hair dried. This Conair product has been a huge help and will last for years. Very good quality for the price. Very happy. Four out of five stars. Took a star off for the delivery complications we had receiving it though.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, this blow dryer gets hot but not too hot. The attachments work well and I would recommend it to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> Very strong blow, compact and easy to use. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Quieter than my last two and dries my hair faster. A litte heavy, but worth it. Highly suggested.</li>
    <li> When my old, favorite blow dryer was discontinued, I ordered this one.  As previous reviews have mentioned, it is a bit heavier than I was used to, but not so much that it&#x27;s hard to handle.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my imagination, but my hair does seem to lay smoother with this dryer, and seems a bit shinier.  However I definitely notice a lack of power with the motor; my old dryer dried my hair faster.  Hmm...wonder if that&#x27;s because it was frying my hair and I just didn&#x27;t know it?</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is not for you if you are 60 or older!  It is very heavy and the controls for speed and temperature are difficult to slide up and down.  Also, it leaves my hair unusually frizzy.  Reviews said that it dries hair really fast, but takes the same amount of time my very old dryer took.  Wish I had kept the packaging to return it!</li>
    <li> Everytime I went to my stylist, I commented how I wanted a hair dryer like hers. But, when she told me how much it cost, I thought I&#x27;d never have a great dryer. I did my research, and I decided to try the Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler [[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]. This is one of the best choices in a product online that I have ever made! My highlighted hair is soft and smooth rather than frizzy and having a damaged appearance. My hair dries in 1/2 the time and is a snap to style while I am drying it. The dryer is a bit heavier than the simple one I had before, but I do not have trouble handling the weight. Everything about this dryer has impressed me, and I would recommend this to anyone hoping to have a professional dryer at a price at least 1/5 of a salon dryer.</li>
    <li> Works really well...gets my hair smooth and straight and work pretty fast. It is kinda bulky and heavy, but it works great</li>
    <li> I think this is ok for someone who doesn&#x27;t need to style their hair only to dry it, the dryer is really heavy and the diffuser blows my hair all over the place. Nobody in my house liked it.</li>
    <li> ..okay, maybe a bit of an overstatement, but I truly feel that way every time I use this thing!  Professional salon results every single time.  I had *thought* that I was using a decent ionic/ceramic hairdryer, but for the past year or so my hair just would not behave.  Frizzy, dry and damaged looking - even though I knew it wasn&#x27;t truly \\&quot;damaged\\&quot;.  Could not figure out what the problem was (post-pregnancy changes?  Wrong products?).  Now I know it was the poor quality dryer I was using.  How I wished I had known this a year ago and saved the $$$ I spent on smoothing/straightening cremes/balms/products - which never worked anyway!    PROS:  + hair dries in 1/2 the time  + smooth and straight with minimal effort  + long-lasting salon smoothness/style throughout the day  + quieter  + cooler - even on high-heat setting    CONS:  + some think it is heavier than most, though I found it no heavier than my last one  + the funnel-shaped \\&quot;concentrator\\&quot; attachment has fixed positions, requiring two hands and some difficulty to move/turn on the fly while drying your hair    My hair is fine, but I have lots of it - and is layered with a significant wave to it, even curly if I choose to make it so.  This dryer gives me smooth, manageable styles with just the right amount of volume (with my round brush).  I also noticed that after being caught in the rain one day, when my hair literally sprung up in curl ringlets from the weather, even the curls were smoother, more defined and not frizzy!  I almost liked my curly hair - and this was hours after I had dried it straight!  This dryer is simply a miraculous tool!</li>
    <li> I really like this hairdryer.  As others have said, it&#x27;s quite powerful and it makes my hair less frizzy that others I have used.  With my old dryer, it would take at least 10 minutes to dry my short hair.  With this one, I have knocked off at least 3 minutes.  I know it doesn&#x27;t sounds like a huge difference, but trust me, when you are in a hurry, it matters!  They only thing I don&#x27;t like about this dryer is the weight.  My arm gets tired before I am finished drying me hair.  Maybe I just need to work out more!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and when she is satisfied, then it simply means that I picked the good product, and good means a lot of things here, performance, size, weight and price. Good job Conair!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as powerfull as it appeared to be by reviews.  Only slightly more power then othere Conair models and other similarly priced brands.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair. My last hair dryer had very low air volume, so when I got the Conair Infiniiti my drying time went from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. It does the high volume with medium heat, so my hair is shinier too.   It does have some weight to it, but I look at it as getting some exercise for my upper body.</li>
    <li> The weight of this dryer really annoys me. Imagine holding a brick over your head, that&#x27;s about how heavy it feels. I wish I would have just spent more and bought a good dryer that wasn&#x27;t so heavy. I&#x27;m a small person, but I&#x27;m no weakling, I workout daily, I can run 12 miles and do push-ups, but still, having to hold this thing up above my head and maneuver it around is annoying, it makes drying your hair a chore. I never noticed the weight of my old dryer, but this one I do. I suggest you pay more and get something that you will enjoy for the rest of your life. This dryer does do a good job of drying, it drys in about 5 minutes and I have long hair, so I can&#x27;t complain about that. Okay, I just weighed my dryers and want to give you a better comparison. My old dryer is a Conair 1875, it takes probably about 10 minutes or more to thoroughly dry my hair and weighs exactly 1 pound. The Conair 213X drys my hair in about 5 minutes, but it weighs 1.6 pounds. 1.6 pounds doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but basically imagine holding one and a half dryers, and that will give you an idea of what it feels like.</li>
    <li> Pros: Leaves your hair soooooo silky smooth. Unbelievable! Drys sooo quick, I can&#x27;t even style it as fast.  Cons: Just a little heavy. But totally worth it.    Yesterday I just bought the 203L model of this conair infiniti professional tourmaline ceramic ionic hair dryer and I think it&#x27;s just the same. I got mine at Rite Aid for only $25. This hairdryer is so great because it leaves your hair unbelieveably silky soft. I have asian hair and I noticed my old 10yr dryer was really destroying my hair. This hairdryer, amazing, I didn&#x27;t know I could have hair this soft! It was as if I was touching a little baby&#x27;s hair, sooooo soft! And my hair wasn&#x27;t flat as a pancake! The downside is, yes the hairdryer is a bit heavier than my old dryer. But it totally makes up for the silkyness and it is very very quick drying. So what&#x27;s a little heavyness going to do. Work out your arm. If you can&#x27;t lift that, you need to go to the gym pronto!  The attachments are okay. The concentrator is pretty good, it even snaps at any different location without moving. Which is easier on your arm position which you dont have to pull your arm a certain way to have the concentrator perfectly on the brush. Just snap the right angle yourself. The diffuser is a little huge, I have no idea what to do with it. It covers like 1/3 of my head.</li>
    <li> I thought it would weigh like a brick from other reviews but it is not that heavy at all.  It dries hair faster and my hair is definitely less frizzy.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> While the product is large to hold, it delivers the power to quick drying which I feel is better for the condition of you hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little doubtful of the \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; revolution, until NOW. This styler/dryer is AWSOME.  It works in less time than a standard dryer, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; up your hair either. It&#x27;s a little heavier than you would expect, but it is solid construction and a great value. bscrandell</li>
    <li> Lots of power!  Great hot and cold temperatures.  Had ours for over a year and still works like the day we bought it.  Just ordered a couple more for the kids bathrooms.  Best dryer we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer.  It&#x27;s fast and very quiet!  It doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched scream that other dryers do.  The dog will even let us dry him with this dryer!  It&#x27;s got great power and dries my hair 5 minutes faster than my old one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer for 7 months and really like it. It really dries my hair fast and does not burn it or dry it out. My only criticism is the placement of the controls. It is impossible to completely grip the handle and not touch the temp &amp; speed buttons. I accidentally switch the controls and trigger the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button just about every time I dry my hair. This hair dryer is heavy enough that you need to be able to hold onto it. I would like to see the controls moved somewhere off the grip in the next version.</li>
    <li> My other Conair still works, but have had it for a long time and wanted to be prepared if it failed.  I love my new Conair!! Seems to dry my hair a little quicker and I don&#x27;t think my hair is so frizzy.  It is a tad heavy, but solid construction.  The cool-shot button gets pushed accidentally from time to time, but no big deal. Overall, great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this hair dryer to replace my old one that I could no longer turn off without unplugging it from the wall. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s quieter than my old hair dryer and dries my hair much faster. My hair even felt softer/shinier than with previous dryers. As many other reviewers have mentioned, this is a bit heavier than my older (cheaper) hair dryer, but because it works so much better, I don&#x27;t have to keep my arms over my head for nearly as long as I used to! I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s an even trade.    I think the only thing I&#x27;ll miss about my old hair dryer is the retractable cord. I have a tiny bathroom, so it was nice to not have the cord hanging out creating clutter.</li>
    <li> I liked this hair dryer, even if it was a little heavy for my small hands. Once I got used to not hitting the cold air button (which is very easy to hit accidentally), I settled in to using it and liked it.  I only used it once or twice a week, and in the summer sometimes not at all. I have curly hair and just briefly dry my  hair to get the extra moisture out, not to style it.  So this hair dryer has been used VERY LIGHTLY.  Today, I took it out to use it (this is about 6 months after I bought it) and only cold air came out.  Not cool air, but COLD air.  Okay, it&#x27;s winter and is very cold outside, so I needed to get the extra moisture out of my hair so I didn&#x27;t freeze walking to the bus.  I thought maybe I was back to pressing the cool air button, but no, I wasn&#x27;t. Then I pressed the cool air button several times to make sure it wasn&#x27;t stuck.  No.  The dryer no longer blows warm or hot air, so it is virtually useless.  Unfortunately I missed the one-month return option.  I won&#x27;t be buying this model again, and probably not a hair dryer from Amazon again.  Disappointing...</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is very good.  It feels like it will last a long time.    does wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was a great upgrade from my last in that it dries my hair faster and my hair feels nicer when I&#x27;m done.  It is quite heavy though, and the cool shot button is very poorly placed.  I accidentally hit it all the time!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this hair dryer. It drys my hair quickly and is very easy to use. The reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because the way the controls are laid out, I accidentally switch the settings all the time.</li>
    <li> I received the hair dryer about 2 weeks ago as of this writing.  I read the reviews and some stated that it was heavy.  I have not found it to be too heavy.  It is not one of those light-weight travel hair dryers, but its weight is fine.    I think it is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is does not seem to blow very hot air like other dryers, yet it dryers my hair quickly.  I have thick hair and the condition is not as good as it should be. My hair is silkier looking after using the dryer and split ends are not seen.  I have not used any of the attachments.     I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I use this type of hair dryer on my black shih tzu Pucci. I purchased this one to replace a more expensive Conair infiniti model that broke down after just a few months of weekly grooming. I had to pay $15 just for the diffuser on the broken one so it cost about twice as much as this one - which I like twice as much. The diffuser on the model was included in the price! The diffuser really works at getting Pucci&#x27;s hair completely dried in short order and leaves the hair shiny and glossy and straight. I have purchased Conairs over the decades and have always been happy with their performance. Even though the more expensive model broke down (my only bad experience with Conair) I still went with Conair for a replacement. I am very pleased with this model.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer before heading to college and compared to my old one it is night and day. This dryer is very powerful and does not cause frizz at all. All of my friends here ask to borrow it all the time and they love it more than I do. It is not heavy and has yet to cause me any problems. Great price for an amazing dryer</li>
    <li> looks great and work fantastic.  I have some gray hairs scattered about and wiht my old blow dryer they would be flying all about calling attention to themselves : ( . After using this blow dry they gray hair lays smooth and flat making the gray look alot more like highlights. My hair is smooth , shiny and it doesn&#x27;t look like I was caught in a wind tunnel. It used to take a good hour or so for my hair to settle down with old dryer. My old dryer got so ridiculously hot that I was all sweaty and my hair flat yet.</li>
    <li> I brought this dryer for my wife and she really likes it.  It dries the hair quickly.  The thing that I like about it is the low noise level compared to her previous dryer, which sounded like a jet plane about to take off.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever. I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the Conair 213X, my hair is shiny and soft. The diffuser is also amazing; I can wear my hair naturally without any frizz.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By far the best dryer out there in this price range. Granted, it&#x27;s heavy, but it cuts my drying time in half and I don&#x27;t have to style after drying which is another plus! It has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the Rhinestones?!</li>
    <li> This dryer has significantly reduced frizz and improved the texture of my hair.  The ionic technology has also greatly improved shine.  It takes about 6-8 minutes to dry my hair (which reaches halfway down my back) - about 35% less time than my old dryer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cord is 6.5 feet long.  There are 3 temperature settings (cool, warm, and hot), and two speeds (low and high).  The dryer comes with a detachable diffuser and a detachable concentrator, making it a good choice for people who use their dryer to achieve different styles.  There is also a cold shot button that actually produces cold air, which is nice for setting a style.  Considering the quality and versatility, this dryer is a great buy.</li>
    <li> It does dry my hair quite fast and is quieter than my last dryer, but not by much.  Only real complaint is the weight. It&#x27;s not light at all.</li>
    <li> I own the 213L model, which is exactly the same as the 213X model, except it has 121 .33CT clear Swarovski crystals studding the handle and steel-paneled body of the dryer, a 9&#x27; professional line cord, and possibly a longer warranty (5 years).  However, it must be essentially the same model due to the fact that it comes with an instruction guide to the 213X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functions: An Ion \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button on the back, rubberized grip handle, cool/warm/hot + low/high functions, and a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button.  The grip is comfortable, even for someone with petite hands, like me.  it has a hinged filter which \\&quot;screws\\&quot; off for easy cleaning.  No more getting hair \\&quot;eaten\\&quot; by the back end of the dryer.  Phew.  My diffuser has the two-toned black/red color, and a black nozzle attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  This dryer works amazingly!  It feels less-powerful on \\&quot;high\\&quot; compared to my last dryer, a 6-year old Revlon 1875 Watt dryer ($20), but this didn&#x27;t affect its usage.  The \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; function is actually cool instead of being somewhat-warm, and using the \\&quot;cold\\&quot; feature even on dry hair seems to smooth it out a bit.  I have thick, straight, mostly coarse hair, and tend to look like a fluffy poodle after washing. My hair simply gains a ridiculous amount of volume and flyaways and I was always afraid to dry my hair all the way, thinking I&#x27;d heat-damage it.  But this hair dryer made my hair straight, sleek, AND smooth!  I am no longer afraid to dry my hair completely, it looked like freaking hair-commercial hair.  The drying time wasn&#x27;t that much diminished from my old dryer, but the difference in quality was definitely noticeable.  I might go so far as to call it a minor \\&quot;miracle.\\&quot;  No more applying balms and salves to make my flyaway strands stay down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Weight is definitely a con on this dryer.  It is no \\&quot;featherweight\\&quot; style and holding it for a lengthy time will build bicep strength.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for me but my biggest arm workout usually involves typing on a keyboard.  But if you like something \\&quot;substantial,\\&quot; this is it.  I estimate about 1.5-2.5 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price difference: With substantial discounts from its MSRP of $140 on the 213L, the price difference between the two was *not* substantial. It sounds dumb, but the resultant $15 price difference for the crystals was worth it for me.  Now my dryer is not just functional, it&#x27;s relatively pretty, and I hate to sound like a giddy little girl, but the sparkles really lift my mood during the chore of drying my hair... and the knowledge that I own one of only 2,500 213L(s) produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other Notes: 5 year limited warranty.  It is *not* dual-voltage, so no dragging it overseas.  Mine also has a handled wooden carrying case with a satin inset, which is a little too ostentatious and large.  High-quality, I just don&#x27;t have room for it.  The Amazon pictures of both products are all accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Note:  Would I buy this again?  Yes.  I compared it to other discount store dryers and high-end dryers.  I almost bought a Hai Jade Air, but seriously, this one seems to have the same functionality as higher-end dryers.  But who wants to spend $165+ on a dryer, anyway?  Save that for your Chi iron.  The only con to this one is that it&#x27;s just a bit heavy.  I think I&#x27;m going to go buy the Infiniti hairbrush too... I&#x27;m *that* pleased.ou like something \\&quot;substantial,\\&quot; this is it.  I estimate about 1.5-2.5 lbs.

    <li> This hairdryer has a very strong air flow and as promised, it really does leave hair with a smoother finish than any hair dryer I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The cool air button is a fantastic feature as well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> I had been using an older Conair 1875 ion dryer for years and decided it was time to upgrade since my hair is much longer now and it was taking a long time to dry.    I was almost convinced that buying a $200 dryer would be a good investment until I did some research and saw that this Conair dryer had all the features I was looking for (tourmaline, ceramic, ionic, AC motor) at under $35.  Although I have never personally used one of the high priced dryers before, I can&#x27;t imagine they work any better than this dryer.  My hair dried in record time and was shiny, full of body, and looked healthier. I have lots of fine hair and even using the ion dry feature, my hair still had lots of body.  I love this dryer!    Edited 3/2/11:   It just stopped working for me this past Saturday and had a horrible burning odor.  I only used the dryer about 3 to 4 times a week for 7 minutes at a time on medium heat and cleaned the lint trap frequently.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a faulty motor, but I am very disapointed that this dryer only lasted me about six months.  After some more research (and a couple of other cheap-o dryers which were returned), I got an Ion Conditioning Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline dryer with AC motor from Sally&#x27;s.  It cost a bit more, but hopefully will last a lot longer.  That&#x27;s the appeal with the AC motor, right?</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old hairdryer after 8 years - a Remington Vortex.  I have moderately curly hair, and was looking for a dryer that would dry my hair quickly and give it lift and definition without making it frizzy.  Since Remington no longer was making the Vortex, I searched and searched for a moderately priced dryer that would give me similar results.  After reading reviews, I chose this one.  First of all, it is one of the most beautiful hair dryers I have ever seen!  But, with it&#x27;s \\&quot;professional\\&quot; status comes a heafty motor that is pretty heavy.  Since I only use it 3 times a week, I really don&#x27;t need a motor that is meant to run 4-5 times a day for blowouts.  When I used it the first time, I actually felt it took it a little longer to dry my hair than my old dryer, and although it didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, I wasn&#x27;t getting the volume I was used to.  I decided to buy another Remington dryer - the 3-in-1 Styler - and returned his blow dryer to Amazon.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer makes such a difference for my hair.  It&#x27;s much less frizzy, it&#x27;s softer and shinier.  I would give this a five star rating if it weren&#x27;t for three negatives: 1) It&#x27;s really difficult to change the controls with one hand 2) Low speed is a bit too strong 3) It is a bit too heavy.  If you can get past these three things go for it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for many dryers before deciding on this one.  A few disclaimers:  I have long, fine, thin and healthy hair that frizzes and curls when I use other dryers.  This dryer makes my hair look like I just left the salon, EVERY DAY!  I love how fast it dries, especially my 4 year old daughter, dries in less than 3 minutes! I also like the temperature controls because it doesn&#x27;t burn her hair or mine!  Overall, I am very satisfied with this hair dryer and I would definitely buy another if/when this one gives out.</li>
    <li> My girl loves it, so I can&#x27;t complain. She has A huge main of curly red hair, And I mean it&#x27;s so serious. But she says this blow dryer gets it done quickly, comfortably and with seemingly little frizz.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over 8 years since we bought this.  It still works perfect.</li>
    <li> The drying indeed seems a little faster with ionic. But it is definitely muted in the sound it makes. Every time my wife starts to dry her huge bundle of hair, the hair drier whine used to get me crazy. I feel a lot better now. The build quality is also pretty good and sturdy. For this price, this is definitely one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> A pretty good hair dryer. (its for my wife)     Noise: a little quieter than most others  Weight: a little lighter then most others in its class    Dries hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer over a year ago and it still works fantastically. I have straight medium length hair and it dries my hair in 10 minutes or less. I only give it three stars, however, because I find this hair dryer a little too heavy for my liking.  Also, the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button and all the other functions for the dryer are located on the inner handle which is a bit frustrating since you hold the dryer from its handle. I often find myself accidently pushing down the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button. I just turn the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button off and the heat immediately starts up again, but I find this so inconveneint and annoying at times.  But for the price, I think this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> a nice blow dryer, however, ridiculously heavy.  when i try to grasp it higher on the handle to lessen the weight, i keep pushing the cool button...so it&#x27;s very awkward to use for me, unfortunately, because if it were lighter, it would be ideal.  great attachments, great dryer.  it only takes me about 5 minutes to blow dry my hair but that is too long with this one!</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product are what helped me make up my mind to buy it and try it for myself, so thank you to everyone for taking the time to post those. I was a bit doubtful it would work because I haven&#x27;t had much luck in the past with blow dryers, but with my thick, wavy hair that frizzes in the Florida heat and humidity, I needed to find something that might help. Well, this HELPS! Never has my hair blown out so sleek and shiny before (and so quickly, too), other than when I had it done at the salon. And yes, it&#x27;s a tad heavier than some models, but the results are worth it, in my opinion! My hair stays smooth and shiny, even after being outside. Conair has hit a home run with this blow dryer! :)</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer. I have short, fine hair. My hair is dried in no time. When I&#x27;m done, it has good body and feels so soft, shiny and healthy! The dryer is pretty quiet, well built and sturdy, on the heavy side but its \\&quot;balanced\\&quot;. Good value for the price. The only negatives are I find myself inadvertantly hitting the blue cold button sometimes and the slide switches are pretty stiff in operation.</li>
    <li> When my hair stylist told me that a hair dryer could make a difference, I didn&#x27;t really believe her, but this dryer has convinced me. I have long, thick hair that takes forever to dry. The first comment any new stylist says is, \\&quot;Gosh, you have a lot of hair.\\&quot; This dryer makes my hair feel silky and dries it much faster than my old dryer. I&#x27;m actually going to order another one since I have to keep going to my 15 year old daughter&#x27;s room to retrieve my dryer. Yes, it is heavier than my old dryer, but I only have to hold it for half the time.</li>
    <li> A great product for the price.  It has performed above my expectations. It is slightly heavier than what I was accustomed to, but, that really hasn&#x27;t been troublesome.  The control buttons are another item that I had to get used to.  Dries hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> I find this product to work very well for me.  I have shoulder length hair that is fine, full and straight.  The time to dry my hair is long, BUT, with this dryer it takes less time and I get much better results.  The dryer is quiet, has warm, hot, and a button for cool air.  You can use either temperature on high or low.  The cool setting is great to set the style.  The unit has a little weight to it, but nothing overwhelming.</li>
    <li> One of my main objectives was to find a quiet, quality hair dryer.  I reviewed several in a much higher price bracket.  This one is quiet and a quality device.</li>
    <li> wow i had no idea id be saying this but after reading the reviews when i purchased this item, and after i received and used it for more than 2 weeks now... they werent kidding! this thing dries ur hair really well and fast without leaving it dry!!! my hair looks healthy and soft throughout the whole day. a must-buy if ur looking for a hair-dryer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice that it reduces my drying time at all, and I&#x27;m not sure that my hair is any less frizzy.. but I do like the hair dryer.  I&#x27;m able to use a round brush with the high setting. (Unlike another dryer I tried that blew too hard and I couldn&#x27;t style my hair while drying it.) &lt;br /&gt;Good dryer overall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace an ionic dryer that I have.  It is heavier, but what bothered me is that it didn&#x27;t put out the heat like my old dryer does.  Though it did fine on most of my hair (which is short and curly/wavy), I had a harder time styling my bangs and the front sides of my hair.  I usually pull them out with a dryer and round brush to make them look smoother and leave the rest of my hair curly.  Also, my hair was no less or more frizzy than my old dryer so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another hair dryer other than a Conair again.  My last Conair was with me for over a decade before it finally died.  I went through 3 other brands in as many years before I chose this as my new dryer.  I won&#x27;t look back.  Dries quickly, with little frizz and leaves my hair shiny and smooth.  I barely run the flat iron through it and I am good to go.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the story of my experience with this dryer.    I have long, wavy, coarse, fine hair that is often a styling nightmare.  I need to build volume AND fight frizz, so it&#x27;s an on-going battle at times.  Honestly, I was crusing along just fine with my myriad of hair products, my round brush and my good old regular 1875 watt dryer until about a month ago when my stylist told me the top layer of my hair looked burned.  She concluded in was my dryer and promptly told me to go out and by a CHI.      Of couse I was distressed by the news and figued I should begin the quest for a new dryer.  In my research, I contemplated the CHI and the T3s but decided that maybe I should start with this one, since the price point was much lower, the tecnology was similar and the reviews were mostly positive.    So.....I was very excited when it showed up and was hoping to have the glorious results that other have shared here.  Alas for me, that was not the case.       On the day of my new dryer&#x27;s debut, I made sure to do all my usual hair ministrations and regualr routine so that I could do an honest comparison.  The first thing I noticed was the the dryer did not produce much heat at all, which made me think it would indeed cause less damage, but made me worry if it would be able to put shape and style in.  To the dryer&#x27;s credit, it did seem to be drying my hair faster despite the lack of heat.    My next issues was that the dryer produced a rather odd oder...and not a pleasant one.  I would have to equate to GARLIC.   I have nothing against garlic, but it is hardly the aromatic experience I am after while blow drying my hair.    So, when the drying process was complete, my hair did look a bit less frizzy, but it was also very flat at the crown and had kind of a strange poufy, fluffy texture throughout.  It is difficult to describe, but I can assure you it was not a look that anyone would covet.      I was worried about styling due to the lack of heat and I was correct to be concerned.  Trying to put any shape or volume in was nearly impossible.  My bangs were particularly awful.  To make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a random Bad Bang Day that no mechanical device could hope to conquer, I wet my bangs down again and used my old dryer and they turned out much better.    Anyway...with the clock ticking and my hair looking utterly awful, I was forced to make an emergency plan involving hot rollers.  I hoped they would at least add a little style and volume so I could get out the door.  At first...it seemed to have worked and when the rollers came out my hair looked halfway decent.  Unfortunately, within an hour the volume and wave had compeltely fallen out and I was left with the fluffy, shapless mess I had started with. To make matters worse, my hair retained the faint garlic-y aroma that the dryer produced nearly all day.      So, In summation my use of this dryer left me flat, fluffy, shapeless and giving off a garlic smell.  I can harldy give this my endoresement!  I&#x27;m glad that people have had success with this product, but my experience was not a good one.</li>
    <li> While a bit heavy, it is sturdy, great temperature controls and even flow that dries hair thoroughly and completely.  And, my husband doesn&#x27;t run from the room because it is actually quieter than any I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> When my beloved Revlon hair dryer finally died recently I found myself in the market for a new one. I attempted to get another Revlon one but wasn&#x27;t able to find one I liked that wasn&#x27;t too heavy or had to thick of a grip on it (I have smallish hands). I finally decided to try this dryer and have been using it approximately a month now and LOVE it so much it has become my new beloved hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new dryer is nice and light without feeling cheap. The price is reasonable. My older dryer was very noisy- and this one is so much quieter. I love that I don&#x27;t feel the need to shut the door so I am not disturbing my family while I am drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> Although this dryer is heavy, it has a professional AC motor which will outlast most other conventional hair dryers.  It is quite a bargain for a professional dryer.  The warranty is outstanding, and the motor is rather quiet.</li>
    <li> Guys, if your looking for a hair dryer for your lady pick this one up. She absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s quiet and she loves it. She said it drys her hair great and I get to sleep better not hearing the fog horn she used to have.     Best thing is I looked great when I didn&#x27;t get the cheapest one from the convenience store. Amazon.com came through again!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works fine but it is much heavier than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. The controls for on/off &amp; heat or a bit hard to use - you have to slide them rather than a switch but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the overall function of the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. It came with a diffuser... and a flat thing which i dont use. There isnt anything that i dont like, the cord length is perfect...the heat is perfect... the cold shot is great.. although i do hit it without realizing it.. but thats no big deal. Great Dryer, great price.. adn the free shipping said it would take up to 3 weeks... but it was at my door within 7 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad to have found this hairdyer! It&#x27;s a great price for a great product.    It&#x27;s makes drying my long (down to my waist) hair much quicker (~5-8 minutes as opposed to ~10-20). It does make my hair feel so much smoother than it does when I use any other hair drier (you don&#x27;t feel like your burning your hair or getting your hands caught in your hair/pulling your hair out).     The only potential con (not really a big deal to me), is yes, it is heavier than a typical hairdyer. On that same note, it makes it feel like it has more substance than the cheaper $20 dollar hairdyers.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter as one of her Christmas gifts. She requested it based on what she had heard and read. She loves the hairdryer because it allows her to work with her very thick hair in more than one way. This a a great dryer and stying tool!</li>
    <li> I am a marketing professional so I think I&#x27;m \\&quot;above\\&quot; much of the marketing companies do to differentiate their products/introduce new products.  I purchased this b/c I needed a 2nd blowdryer for our vacation home - it was rated well and reasonably priced but I wasn&#x27;t convinced by this newly boasted \\&quot;ion\\&quot; technology this and other blowdryers position themselves.  But it really made a difference in my long, thick and sometimes frizzy hair!  It shortened the time of blowdrying (from 15min with my old dryer to 5) AND the hair was much smoother/more managable.  The unit isn&#x27;t small but the weight some reviewers commented on wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I was excited for a new hair dryer cause the one I was using was on it&#x27;s last leg. I read the reviews and thought this one looked good. I was very dissapointed. It&#x27;s actually too powerful. Using the diffuser attatchment is kind of a joke. It blows your hair everywhere, and that&#x27;s not really what you want for attatchments. I do have curly hair and i like the heat to be concentrated on just where I want it. It is impossible to do with this dryer. Also the on/off switches are in a stupid place like alot of other hair dryers. I&#x27;m not quite sure who designs these things. The positive about this dryer is that I have no frizz after drying. Would not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This dryer is fabulous.  I have thick curly hair and this dryer dried my hair in half the time it normally takes and without the frizz.  I love it.  The only downfall is that it is substantially heavier then any other drier I have owned.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer on 1/29/07...and got exactly 4 months out of it.  5/29, the heating element died &amp; now it only blows cold air.  I would have given it 1 star, but it worked great till then.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Pretty quiet.  A bit heavy.  Hair seems to be alot smoother than with my old dryer.  Overall, a good product.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It cut my hair drying times in half.  I have long fine hair that normally takes about 15 minutes to completely dry.  With this dryer, it takes about 8 min.The weight was not bad, I&#x27;m used to heavier dryers.    UPDATE 2011 - This dryer is still very good.  However, I found a better one in Babyliss which is WAY lighter and easier to use, just as effective too.  See my other reviews since I can&#x27;t figure out how to link it here :)  It&#x27;s still going strong after 3 years.  I use it once in awhile now as I keep it for spare in the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I had used an ionic styler in the past but was not that impressed. This hair dryer may be slightly heavy, but the results make you forget all about that. It leaves my hair without frizz even on the dampest of days and oh, what a timesaver... my hair used to take 20 minutes to dry and now it takes just 10!!!</li>
    <li> I have long (4 inch below shoulder), straight hair with a bit of a frizz. I have never been able to get a salon finish with my old hair dryer and this one for sure brought me closer. But I think the claims are too much.  &lt;br /&gt;--My hair is long and this a heavy dryer (3 lbs). I get quite tired after using it and especially when I am doing the back hair. &lt;br /&gt;--It does leave the hair softer but since the dryer motor is weaker than salon quality hair dryers, it has less pull which means less control. It is harder to do anything more than the basic straight blow drying quickly. For finishing the ends, you end up relying more on the brush than the dryer. &lt;br /&gt;--I did not notice the drying time to be faster which is supposed to be the one of the big advantages of ionic dryers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the dryer works well for its price with some anti-frizz product. I would not expect to be able to do salon style look in 10 mins or even 20 mins as most of the reviews claim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> Product works well and appears well made.  A little cumbersome perhaps, but durability and performance not sacrificed for space savings.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of some of the reviews on this dryer. I had a hard time believing that a blow dryer had the ability to make my hair look healthier and shiny. Well, I&#x27;m so glad I was proved wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thin, but it&#x27;s usually so frizzy by the time I&#x27;m done drying it straight. With this blow dryer, my hair doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of fly aways and it looks so shiny!&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years, I&#x27;m actually happy with how my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two negatives with this dryer. The placement of the buttons is awkward. The way they&#x27;re positioned on the handle makes it hard for you to dry your hair without changing the settings or turning it off on accident.&lt;br /&gt;The second negative is the weight of the dryer. At first, I thought it was way too heavy. Now, a few weeks later, I&#x27;ve completely adjusted to it.&lt;br /&gt;Even with those two negatives, I would still highly recommend this blow dryer. I can&#x27;t believe I went so long using one that was so sub par to this.</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer for my wife after she complained her old one took forever to dry her hair.  She says this Conair drys extremely quickly and is the best dryer she has ever had.  She doens&#x27;t really use the attachments so she couldn&#x27;t say anything bad/good about them.  She highly recommends this dryer and says it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Picked this up because my dryer died. It is a little heavy, but it is much quieter than my previous dryer. And it dries my hair faster. Overall, a good value.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice hair dryer for the price.  It is powerful and much more quite than I thought it would be.  It dries my short, but thick hair quickly and the cold shot button really works.  It also dries much faster then my old Revlon hair dryer and makes my hair nice and shiny.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is a little on the heavy side and I wish the cord was retractable.</li>
    <li> This dryer is nice.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any faster but it does work well and my hair really does feel shinnier and healthier.  It is a bit heavier than I was used to but not problematicly so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this for myself. I was looking for an ionic styler that was reasonable priced and works well. This is it! It&#x27;s a great styler and works really well and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. Plus it comes with the attachments which I love.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a little heavy but I can work with that.  Overall, I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I give this product a 4 1/2. It works great and dries your hair really fast. I had another conair that i did like but this one is amazing! The reason I didnt give it a 5 is because, like most people said, it is heavy. But other than that this is a great product and i recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> This dryer is amazing! Though it is a bit heavier than others, it dries my hair 3 times faster! I love it and have been recommending it to all my friends!!</li>
    <li> I have curley thick hair that usually takes 45 min. to blow dry. This dryer does it in about 20 min. With the diffuser (and product) I have almost no frizz. I love this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had--it makes my hair soft and smooth, like at a salon.  I have medium-length hair, a little above my shoulders, so I don&#x27;t mind that the dryer is a little heavy, because it doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry.  I would highly recommend this, and it&#x27;s a great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but so far I can&#x27;t fault it. Great price and gets hair really dry (yes, you&#x27;d think that would be a prerequesite for all hairdryers, but my Vidal Sassoon one was terrible - it steamed my hair).    Not too heavy, either (trust me, I&#x27;m a wimp!)</li>
    <li> Well priced. Sort of on the heavy side.  Dries hair very fast.  No Frizzies!!!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. After spending a decent amount of time researching for the best hair-dryers, I came up with two options. T3 and this Conair 213X hair-dryer. All the options and descriptions were true for both of the items, however the price made a huge difference. I decided to save some money and purchase this one and didn&#x27;t get disappointed. It&#x27;s light, powerful, makes my hair more silky (compared to my old one) and just feels good in my hands. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I ever had with large controls so there is no fiddleling around, great blowing power, perfect ceramic technology (which does make a difference!).  There are people here on this review board, who complain of the weigth: if you should think that the hairdryer is \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; then you must be a true \\&quot;couch potatoe\\&quot; and need to get up and move around a little more!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair dryer. It is definitely a salon quality dryer.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Simply put - I&#x27;ve always wanted a quiet, powerful, and sturdy blower without spending a fortune. This one fits that description perfectly. I&#x27;ve used quieter machines, but the sacrifice of heat and force wasn&#x27;t worth it. You could spend more, but I&#x27;m not sure why you would...</li>
    <li> Powerful and easy to use, although a little heavy and noisy. Considering the price, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend this hair dryer.  It dries my hair fast, and I like that it has the cool air setting without having to hold the cool button.  I compared the price to hair dryers at Walmart and decided to choose this one instead because I got more for my money.  The only downside is that is a little bit heavier than other hair dryers.  Overall, it is a really good hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Did a great job blow drying my hair, but the dryer is too heavy for me so I am exchanging it for something lighter. Also, the cool button is located right where your index finger goes, so you end up accidentally pressing it quite a bit.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have shared this blow dryer for the past two year. It gets used at least every day.I have never had a problem with it and both of us have healthy, sleek, and shiny hair. I receive many compliments on my hair, almost daily.  After sharing, I need my own blow dryer. I thought I should splurge on a high-end product, but after scouring reviews, I decided to just buy another one of these products. It works great, its cheap, and it does what high-end products say they do.  Save yourself some bucks! Only draw back: it could be quieter, but my hairdresser expensive dryer is louder!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer meets &amp; exceeds all of my expectatations, but the diffuser is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speed &amp; heat settings are great, the noise level is pretty low - it does a fantastic job drying - seems to be much more even than my last dryer which left wet sections next to near-burnt sections.  Sometimes a product will have a &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; setting, and there&#x27;s not much of a difference.  In this case, it&#x27;s really nice to actually have a low setting for the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of curly hair, so I feel that the diffuser is quite shallow in depth compared to the last one I owned - my hair kinda spills out instead of sitting &#x27;in&#x27; it.  However, the shallow diffuser shape seems to be the trend, so unless you have an old-school one that fits over the nozzle, I don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ll have much of a choice in new dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the dryer, and say &#x27;meh&#x27; about the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********Update on 11/2010*************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this hair dryer for almost two years, and I had to upgrade from four stars.  I use it 3-4 days/week, and it&#x27;s still in fantastic shape.  I&#x27;ve dropped it on the tile floor about 50 times, and there&#x27;s no cracking or scratches.  Definitely the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve grown to really like the diffuser.  Since it snaps to the front, there are no rubber parts that degrade in the heat (as I&#x27;ve experienced with other models), so it still fits the same and works great after two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plus - the filter/vent on the back twists off, so you can rinse it in the sink easily to remove hair/gunk.  Great feature!</li>
    <li> I wanted to change my hairdryer to get a lighter and a more quiet one! but I think I haven&#x27;t made a good purchase, this hair dryer is too heavy and also makes lots of noise. But don&#x27;t back up, overall it&#x27;s not that bad!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Conair 213X and am very happy with it. The heat  and speed settings are convenient and easy to change while drying. It  does a really nice job even on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a fabulous blow dryer. After reading all the reviews I purchased the infiniti and thopugh it is good, it is not as great as everyone has stated. It has dryed my hair like any other dryer. Nothing special has been added to the end product. The only noticeable difference between this and other blow dryers is that it does blow dry extremely faster than my old dryers.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!!This Conair is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.I initially bo&#x27;t a cheapo Vidal Sasoon for $10.00. It was pretty lightweight, but it got so hot my hair burned-I called it the \\&quot;screamin&#x27; demon\\&quot;--the sound was ear-splitting. This wonderful Conair is not loud at all; it has high/low warm settings--the warm is not hot; there is high/low hot setting; and the cool is actually COOL with a high/low setting.  It&#x27;s the best dryer ever for me. This dryer is a little on the heavy side, as I have Lupus with complications, but I will certainly compensate for that by leaning my arm on the counter. My hair shines, it doesn&#x27;t snarl and knot up, and I&#x27;m happy as can possibly be! Buy it, you&#x27;ll never regret it. Do it now!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer several years ago and it has surpassed my expectations. It takes no time at all to dry my hair and the cool setting is legitimately cool air. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works and performs as advertised as well as being well made.</li>
    <li> Purchase one for my wife who has long hair.  Needed a durable dryer that wasn&#x27;t too loud.  She used it every day for two years before the motor finally gave out.  Good product for the price; will probably buy another one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well, but it&#x27;s the heaviest dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair does look nice and smooth, but I wish I had purchased a lighter one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say this is a quiet dryer: it has the same loud irritating high-pitched whine as most hair dryers.  I had to return it, and I&#x27;ll continue my search for a truly quiet dryer.</li>
    <li> I have curly,fine hair that is color treated. And even with an ionic dryer I just wasn&#x27;t getting the \\&quot;no frizz\\&quot; results I wanted. I bought this hair dryer  both for the ionic property and the diffuser. I have been very happy with the results. A bonus I had not realized until using it was how fast it dried my hair.  It gives me great curl and lift without the frizz. I especially like the cold shot feature which really does set my style. I would recommend this dryer in a heart beat.  Thanks Conair!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the packaging for starters.  I rushed into the bathroom to try this dryer out and I was amazed!  This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  My hair was silky, bouncy and just looked beautiful within a few minutes.  I highly recommend this dryer.  The price point for the quality is something to take advantage of.</li>
    <li> Very powerful hair dryer..took a bit to get used to, as it could probably blow my previous hairdryer across the room!    Biggest drawback is the weight...this dryer will sculpt your forearms. Not sure I will be able,or willing to travel with this beast.    But am pleased with it, and hope it lives a long life.</li>
    <li> I put off buying a new hairdryer for a long time. My old dryer (I don&#x27;t even know what brand it was...it was supposed to be Ionic and \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;) took quite a long time to dry my hair, and it made my hair really puffy. I just assumed these were things that I had to live with.    I was wrong.    I finally broke down and started searching for a new dryer. I wanted to use Amazon so I could read customer reviews. I found the reviews on this product were all pretty positive, so I took a chance and ordered this dryer.    THIS HAIRDRYER IS AMAZING. The first time I used it, I felt like I had entered warp-speed...it was drying my hair so fast! I read the instructions which say to use it on the low setting first to help quick dry the hair. This helps! I swear, my hair dries within about five minutes (and I have a TON of hair). Also, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair all puffy. It leaves it nice and straight - which cuts down on my straightening time too! To sum it up - I love this hairdryer.    My ONLY complaint is that I don&#x27;t really like the diffuser. I think it&#x27;s because the hairdryer is just so strong, the diffuser doesn&#x27;t really work to spread out the air that well. I have to manipulate my hair into being \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; so this didn&#x27;t really help it achieve that status! But other than that, I would completely recommend this hairdryer to everyone. It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> I bought this after my Conair Ion Shine travel dryer of 12 years finally died.  I can only compare these two dryers to each other, since I haven&#x27;t had a ton of experience with other dryers.  I have a lot of straight fine shoulder length hair.  The Conair 213XP has great features and versatility.    Without using product, it does a good basic dry, and leaves my hair looking nice with some body (but not necessarily volume).  When I style my hair (round brush in layers) with product, the time is not any shorter than my use with the Ion Shine Traveler.  The dryer does start to feel heavy after holding it up over my head for 20-30 minutes, trying to do all the layers.  It is a little awkward because of the weight and location of the buttons.    If I had my pick I would revive my Ion Shine Traveler for its size and lightness, and the fact that I can easily fold it up to take it anywhere.    However, I still believe Conair makes good dryers, and will continue to use and experiment with this one.</li>
    <li> It took me a few weeks to get used to this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s heavy and the buttons/adjusters are not in the best place.  It&#x27;s also a little noisy and the \\&quot;low\\&quot; is not that low.  Now that I have gotten used to it, I am okay with it.  It just took some getting used to I guess.  I still can&#x27;t give it a 4 or a 5 because I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Initially found the dryer heavy, cord way too long and easy to twist, controls awkward...and then it quit working. Will return to purchasing cheap models that last for years.</li>
    <li> I love this product. For years i have been using an old hair dryer and finally i decided to buy a new one and i could not be happier. I have long thick wavy hair and it use to take me atleast an hour if more to make my hair look straight. But now with this product it took me less then half the time. I recommend this product to everyone. Amazing just amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace my \\&quot;Revlon 1875 Watt Full Size Hair Dryer - Chrome\\&quot;. My Revlon dryer still works, but it a little too loud. So now it&#x27;s serving as a backup. This Conair 213X seems to dry my hair a little quicker than the Revlon. And it is a little quieter too. The weight of the 213X doesn&#x27;t bother me, but you definitely feel the weight. In fact I like it heavy because it feels like it&#x27;s better quality. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It really powerful. And it keeps my hair silky. I don&#x27;t mind washing my hair right before sleep. I Like it</li>
    <li> I have almost waist length wavy hair that takes me hair 3-4 hours to dry completely. With this dryer, I was able to dry 90% of my hair in 4-6 minutes on medium heat with the slowest speed! I used the diffuser which has nice \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; that gave me lift at the roots. I was able to both \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; my hair and comb through it with the diffuser and it helped to dry my hair, but maintain my curls. The heat does not feel excessively warm and does not leave any hot spots. I have not used it without the diffuser, but plan to use it with the concentrator to straighten my hair. This dryer did not make my hair as frizzy as other dryers I have used. For the price, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer finally died. It was very old and this whole tourmaline thing seemed like a giant hoax to me but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.     I&#x27;ve read some reviewers that mention that this dryer doesn&#x27;t get very hot and from what I&#x27;ve read about the tourmaline, that&#x27;s the point. This dryer does not get nearly as hot as my old Vidal Sassoon one did but it did dry my hair twice as fast. My hair was also wetter than usual which made the faster drying time even more impressive to me. Less heat, less heat damage although I do spray my hair with a heat damage reducer before I dry it. I&#x27;m convinced that the tourmaline does live up to the faster drying claims. As for the shiny/more sleek claims? I&#x27;m not so sure. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem more shiny or sleek or anything like that. EDIT: I have now dried my hair several days in a row without any sort of product in it (just after washing and conditioning). My hair does not seem to be any more shiny than it was before nor do there seem to be fewer flyaways. It does however feel VERY different to the touch. It feels much smoother and much softer than it did before. It also appears to have more bounce.      My old dryer sounded like a plane. This one is extremely quiet. If you have roommates, it probably wouldn&#x27;t disturb them if you closed the bathroom door. I have not tried the attachments yet so I won&#x27;t comment on those. The cord on this dryer is also longer than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned which for me is a big plus as I tend to hold the dryer far away from my head and very high up as I dry.    Now for the negatives. I dislike the sliding on and off switch and sliding heat control switches but that&#x27;s just my personal preference and it&#x27;s a minor annoyance since I tend to have trouble sliding the switches. The biggest disadvantage to this dryer is the weight. I find it very heavy. It weighs almost twice as much as my old dryer. Since my main use is to just quickly dry my hair, the weight really isn&#x27;t enough forme to return it. But if you use your hair dryer for long periods of styling, you may want to look at another model.    Overall, I think this is a great dryer. Aside from the weight, I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  My daughter and I both use it (both have long, thick hair), and we are amazed at how much faster we can dry our hair.  This dryer is heavier than most, as others have pointed out, but it must be due to the superior mechanics needed to generate this type of drying power.  I&#x27;ve purchased many other dryers over the years, and none of them have held a candle to this one.  I will never buy any other type of dryer again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this hair dryer because I needed a new one, it was cheap, and the reviews said it was good.    Well I think it is amazing! I absolutely love it! It has 3 temperature settings: cool, warm, and hot, and a low/high setting. I just use the hot while I dry and then when it&#x27;s done drying use the cool setting to cool my hair down and it doesn&#x27;t take forever for my hair to dry either. Probably about 5-10 min, not too sure since I didn&#x27;t time it.    It says it uses negative ions to reduce frizz, prevent fly aways from sticking up, and minimize heat damage, which it does for me. My hair usually gets really frizzy when I use a hair dryer but it didn&#x27;t when I used this one and the fly aways don&#x27;t stick up.    It&#x27;s also not loud, it&#x27;s the quietest dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. And to top it all off it makes my hair shiny and soft without putting any product in.    I just love everything about this hair dryer and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and the quality of the dryer is great. I use it pretty close to my hair (but not for very long) and on high temperatures, and it still doesn&#x27;t damage it like my old dryer used to. I did my homework on the best combo of ionic/ceramic/tourmaline dryers and this was consistently on the top. I&#x27;d give it my 5* too, no reason to shell out triple digits on a hair dryer.     *Note, I have normal, slightly wavy dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> I bought it years ago and it still works perfectly ! It makes nice curls and dries hair very ( very ) quickly !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Unless I&#x27;m straightening my hair, I always use the diffuser attachment on my hair dryer.  I have thin, naturally curly hair that&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulders.  That being said, after about 6 months of using this dryer, the diffuser attachment is completely melted.  I&#x27;ve been using hair dryers with diffusers for probably about 15 years now and I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this.  The dryer works well, but I&#x27;m a little concerned with the melting and I think I&#x27;m going to try a different hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer because of the diffuser and concentrator attachments. After watching natural hair youtube videos, I wanted to \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; my tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair LOVES the diffuser attachment with a leave-in conditioner and styler on top. My curls are well defined after using the diffuser on LOW heat and HIGH speed to prevent heat damage. The buttons give you plenty of options for temperature and speed settings. There&#x27;s even a COLD button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW for the concentrator, you MUST use a styler with HOLD on natural black curly hair because your hair will be a FRIZZ mess if you don&#x27;t. I found out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my curls are SO TIGHT, when attempting to stretch it with the concentrator, my curls MUST be well conditioned with a product that has HOLD.</li>
    <li> Wow....After I got the famous RevlonRV544 and I did not like it , I decided to get that one back to the store and order this from Amazon instead.No doubt this one is much better from Revlon .quality is wonderful.But Man oooo Man ...It&#x27;s   work out.specially if you attach the defuser .I do not know maybe my hand is too short(Not).but its to hard avoiding to stick the dryer to your head.the noise is really low,I love the quality of product.very nice overal.the ONLY problem is handeling it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The cool air setting is a great addition.  Drying time is shorter than with previous dryers due to the professional quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer because of the recommendations that I read at Amazon.  After using it a little over a month, I am returning it as it was defective.  Today, it puffed out a cloud of smoke and then would get so hot that the air on high was hot enough to hurt!!    The up side is that drugstore.com and Amazon have been very helpful!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace an older model that had finally died.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.  This dryer dries my thick, curly hair faster and without frizz.  It is a bit heavier, but overall a great dryer.</li>
    <li> i have fairly long hair and i used to hate blow drying it. i would usually dry just half my hair before i got tired and left for work with the other half semi-wet. then my hair dryer broke and for four days i went to work with my hair all wet and tied in a bun (so my shirt wouldn&#x27;t get wet). then my order for this conair model came. i chose it based off amazon consumer reviews that mentioned it was slightly heavy but in no time you forget and that it drys it in half the time. the product came all dusty and what-not (bc it was in an outdated flimsy plastic packaging) but i just wiped it clean with a cleaner. and i tried it and whoa~ love that Warm+High setting. it&#x27;s not too hot but the strength of the air blows my hair so quickly that i actually dryed my hair all the way and went to work. i was so impressed that i could actually get my hair straightened since i have slightly curly hair otherwise. even my coworkers noticed and asked if i had plans that evening. haha, nope, just a new hair dryer~ no more going to work with semi-wet hair and getting icicles by the time i step into the office! this is one happy purchase.   4 stars for old packaging and 5 stars for drying my hair so quickly</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing a hair dryer.  I really didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference either way.  My hair has always looked a little dried and frayed after drying my hair.  I either have to curl the ends or straighten it after drying it.  This hair dryer really is great.  My hair looks smooth and perfectly styled after just blow drying.  I didn&#x27;t really believe that it would be heavy, but it is a little bit.  The warm is not WARM, and the hot is not HOT.  I never dry my hair at a hot temperature anyway, so the hot works fine for me.  I still love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, blows hard.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST hairdryer I have ever owned. I use it every day. I purchased this hair dryer 5 years ago, and it&#x27;s still working well which is impressive. You can adjust the heat (high or low) and it also has a cool air function. It dries your hair quickly without burning it, and there is no static/frizz problem. The cord comes with a handy attachment that you can use to bundle it for clean storage. Sometimes dust builds up on the back of the dryer, but you can detach that piece and easily clean it. I would highly recommend this product, and it&#x27;s also a great value.</li>
    <li> Great blow-dryer and still holding up after years but very heavy.  Hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5!</li>
    <li> Ultimate dryer for very fine hair!!!! No frizz. No hair products needed.</li>
    <li> This dryer is a bit heavy but it works quickly. I use the attachment to blow dry my hair without blowing it all over my face.  &lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best and fastest dryers we have used. &lt;br /&gt;I would reorder the same dryer if needed. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! My old dryer was getting old and the fan in it was pretty weak. I can&#x27;t believe how powerful the Conair dryer is, and how quickly it can dry my thick hair. Even the hottest setting is not very hot, it doesn&#x27;t burn my ears like my old dryer, but it takes less than half the time. Other reviews have said it is heavy, I noticed it when I took a shower after working out my arms and when I was almost finished drying my hair, but that was the only time. I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blowdryer for a year now &amp; love it. I have thick curly hair that frizzes easily. This dryer works at least twice as fast as my last one, without getting too hot to burn my hair. And it really cuts down on the frizzies!  It is a little heavier than a normal dryer, but since I&#x27;m not holding it as long, it&#x27;s no problem. I have carpel tunnel in my right hand and it dosn&#x27;t bother it. I&#x27;m now buying one for my Stepmom, as she loves mine.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a month- I love the heat it puts out and the power it has. It is a little heavy, as others have stated, but I look at that as a small workout for my arms. The features are great as well- the screen on the back is very easy to clean, unlike my last dryer, and that really saves the motor. The cord is nice and long so you have the ability to move around. It does feel like a professional dryer, but for a really good price. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it comes with a great price. I had a T3 dryer and after it broke, I got this one. Boy, was I surprised! It worked just as good as the T3 and cost a fraction of the price. The attachments are easy to use, and I am able to get a great wavy hairstyle with the diffuser. The concentrator gives great lift at the roots!</li>
    <li> I cannot begin to count how many hair dryers I have bought so far but this is the one that I now know I can&#x27;t live without! I have paid more money for other dryers, but none of them compare to this one and usually the more expensive ones don&#x27;t last as long either! It is very easy to use and my hair shines when I am done drying. It is very quick also, I have very thick hair so what used to take about 20 minutes now takes about 10! I have not used the diffuser so I do not have a comment on that. And I agree that it is a little heavier than other dryers that I have owned, but like someone else said: Your not carrying it around all day! I love this dryer and really can not say enough great things about it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler because it was recommended in an ariticle online by a professional hair stylist.  It has proven a disappointment as my hair does not get the styling volume that I enjoyed with my previous unit.  The difference seems to stem from the lower heat and air produced by the Conair 213X.  Guess you get what you pay for - I&#x27;ll be buying ANOTHER trully professional hand-held hairdryer soon.  Maybe you can avoid this mistake by skipping this one and buying a unit with MORE POWER;-)</li>
    <li> When my husband surprised me with this blow dryer, I admit I was a bit skeptical.  It is heavier than my old hair dryer.  But my old hair dryer will never ever see my hair again.  It is like night &amp; day - my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy like it normally is when I blow dry it right after the shower.  Normally I had to make sure I had time to let it dry naturally to reduce frizz but that&#x27;s not that easy everyday.  Now I don&#x27;t stress about if I&#x27;m going to have fried hair or nice, smooth hair.  My blow dryer always gives me nice, smooth hair.</li>
    <li> My wife is a hair dresser, so buying a hair dryer for Christmas is a big jump for me.  It is a nice dryer, with adequate heat and power.  It has a cold air button for quick shots of cool air, and is relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit heavy though, but if you are not doing hair all day it is not that big a deal.</li>
    <li> The basic dryer is solid.  I can live with the hefty weight.  It&#x27;s nice and quiet for use with my pets.  What kills this thing for me is that the control positions are often inadvertently changed just using the widget normally, which is ANNOYING.  This issue includes the cool air button.  Overall, this deficiency is so significant to me that I have ordered another dryer and will toss this one.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised; does a great job in drying and styling hair.  It is slightly on the \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; side to hold but I don&#x27;t find it a problem.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair dryer, and definitely made my hair softer than the real cheapo discount store ones, however....it&#x27;s VERY heavy, in fact I know I&#x27;ve never felt a heavier one, so if you have arthritis or any hand condition, you may want to skip it. Also, the cool button is very easy to accidently push (if you are right handed) and the control buttons are rather hard to move up and down. Maybe they will \\&quot;loosen\\&quot; up with time.     So, I like the effect this dryer gives, but the design was not very well thought out.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and blowdrying it every morning was beginning to become a real chore.  My old dryer took forever and completely dried out my hair, but this hairdryer does the trick in no time and without the damage. My hair feels a lot softer and healthier now.  It is a little heavier than some dryers but the results you get are worth it.  I would definitely recommend this item.  Oh, and the shipping was very quick.  I got it in no time.</li>
    <li> My stylist told me about this dryer as my hair is so fine and gets damaged by the dryer. This dryer makes a big difference and is worth the price. My hair is shiney and healthy now. Yes, it is a bit heavy but it dries your hair so fast you will not mind. Hold it like stylists do on the body, you can as it will not burn you.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer works very well, with impressive forceful drying capacity and a quiet motor.  The only drawback is that it is somewhat heavy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister.  It is slightly heavier than her previous model, but getting used to the new model was easy.  It works quickly, isn&#x27;t too loud, but my sister says the attachments are a bit of a pain.  If you need to use the attachments on a daily basis, this might not be the right model for you.  Other than that - GREAT hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, but it dries my hair faster and with less frizz. Yes, it weighs more than many other driers but I&#x27;m holding it up for less time. It&#x27;s worth it to me. Can&#x27;t beat the price for such a cutting edge product.</li>
    <li> The product works great. It dries my hair fairly quickly and my hair ends up being soooo soft. I highly recommend. It is a little heavier than most driers, but after a few days I didn&#x27;t notice this anymore. It looks cool and is a fabulous dryer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many other hair dryers that were just as cheap, and they either burnt out within a year or didn&#x27;t dry my hair sufficiently.  I bought this one a year ago and I can finally say that it&#x27;s definitely a keeper.  Dries my hair in half the time of those other cheap ones.</li>
    <li> I had given this hair dryer to my daughter as a gift, but when I went back to get one for myself, they were out of stock.  Imagine how elated I was to find it here on Amazon at a price that was lower than the one at the store!  it&#x27;s a really good hair dryer and never makes my hair frizzy, even on the highest heat, and dries my hair faster than any other dryer I have owned.  I was so glad to find it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer just over 2 years ago because I was tired of the shrill and weak dryers available at the local store. Having checked a few salons, I quickly found the price to use what the professionals use was way too expensive for the average person.    Here was the criteria I used when shopping: 1) affordable 2) strong motor 3) durable and 4) effective.    Based off of the other reviews, this seemed to be the one. Here&#x27;s how it has performed.    My hair: thick, long and straight. I use the dryer daily.     Build: this dryer is built well of plastic and metal with a rubber handle. I like the way it feels solid in the hand and the form is comfortable. It&#x27;s a little heavy for me, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. The cord is longer which is nice, but a retractable one would have been perfect. I like the removable lint trap that is easy to vacuum.     Sound: it&#x27;s a lot quieter than my cheaper drug store dryer. Because the professional motor isn&#x27;t overburdened when I dry on high, it&#x27;s more of a low &#x27;whoosh&#x27; than the high &#x27;wheee&#x27; of weaker motors. Since I have found the lowest level sufficient for my hair type, daily noise from this dryer is minimal. Others in the house used to wake up at the sound of the cheaper dryer, but now they remain asleep down the hall with the door open.     Durability: it&#x27;s been over 2 years, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the dryer. It still looks exactly the same as when it arrived.    Performance: my hair dries in about 2-3 minutes on low. If I&#x27;m in a rush, 1.5 min on high. It gives me more time to get to work so this helps a lot.     Since purchasing this dryer, 2 others who have used mine have purchased their own and are also happy campers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this dryer three stars because it works okay...nothing great, but nothing terrible, either.  I used it for almost exactly 2 years before it began to smell like it was on fire (yesterday), so I will replace it with something else entirely.  I was disappointed in it given the high number of great reviews.</li>
    <li> Worst hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Was extremely heavy and after a few months of usage it completely failed. No joke, I turned it on and it blew up. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife at the beginning of 2011 and my wife still uses it everyday. She said it&#x27;s the best one she has had at drying and it has lasted the longest of any she has owned</li>
    <li> product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use</li>
    <li> I originally bought this dryer for my mother who was using an ancient hair dryer that barely blew air.  I decided that I needed to test it out first.  Well, I loved it so much that I kept it for myself.  It cut my drying time in half.  I love how even the hottest air from the dryer seems cool compared to my old hair dryer.  Also, I decided to get this for my best friend for Christmas.  She has long, thick hair.  She emailed me after two days of use and said (rather melodramatically) that the hair dryer had changed her life!  She said that it cut her blowing time in half.  She has mentioned it two other times since Christmas so she is very impressed and thrilled with the product.  The only negative is that it is very heavy compared to my previous dryer.  It took me a couple weeks to get used to it but now my arm doesn&#x27;t remember the difference.  I bought another one for my mother who likes it but said that it was drying her hair so quickly that she has to use the diffuser attachment so she has time to strategically style her hair with a brush before it is dry.  We all highly recommend this product.  Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer after my professional Conair Yellowbird from the late 70&#x27;s broke.  I definitely wanted another Conair and I wanted to move into the 21st Century!  I did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  As the other reviewers have stated, this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time!  It&#x27;s also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are \\&quot;dry brushing\\&quot; your hair.  It does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim.  Otherwise, it is very solidly built and I hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the best. It doesn&#x27;t feel that strong but it dries faster than any blow dryer I have ever used. It leaves hair incredibly soft with a lustrous shine. Hair maintains style longer. And the price is right. Really impressive.</li>
    <li> As I researched hair dryers I was looking for performance, price and reliability.  The reviews I read said that this hair dryer improved the quality of your hair.  I was skeptical at first, but after only one use I saw a significant difference.  My hair looked much healthier!  This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> i definitely would never buy it for more than the rebate price, but for the thirty-something i paid, definitely a good deal. it makes my hair softer and doesn&#x27;t dry it out too much - also works great with the infiniti brushes and combs    the option for cool air is very nice and works wonderfully for smoothing my bangs and it does a decent job with my extremely long, curly hair...especially with product added</li>
    <li> PROS: Dries fast, leaves hair shiny, several setting combos, long cord.    Cons: Way too heavy, cool button gets pushed accidentally because of its location.    I don&#x27;t think it dries hair extremely fast but then again I do have lots of thick hair. If the cool shot button was moved and they took some weight off of this big boy then it would be a great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The first few times of use, the unit smelled like burnt rubber. It dries hair fast but feels heavier than other plastic models. This was worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  It dries my hair quickly, but my hair is also much healthier.  Previously, I had a Vidal Sassoon hairdryer, which I bought only 9 months ago.  In the last few months, I noticed problems with my hair, including frizziness and damaged ends.  These are not typical problems for me.  I also started having trouble with hairdryer, and I trashed it when it sucked my hair into the dryer and fried it.  I immediately ordered the Conair hairdryer after doing some research.  Not only does it dry quickly and well, but the frizziness is gone and my hair looks so much better!  I never knew a hairdryer could make that much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Was a present for my wife and she sais that is wonderful, maibe one of the most practical one</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my wife. she likes this a lot, says this is the best. She likes the speed and heat controls..</li>
    <li> Works great!  Dries my hair really quick!  My only comlaint is that it is a little heavy compared to my last hair drier.</li>
    <li> Pros- I chose the model b/c it got great reviews and reasonable price. The construction is solid and it dries my hair very fast. I like having the different heat settings especially in the summer.  Cons- It is heaver than my last hair dryer and the switches are harder to use. I would recommend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve used. It dries my hair much faster, saves me time and it&#x27;s easy to use. It could be balanced a little better and maybe lighter. Maybe the next generation may take care of that issue. My daughter tried it; and liked it as well and now she wants one too!</li>
    <li> Considero muy caro para la poca potencia que tiene.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer will literally blow your mind. It does the job with speed, won&#x27;t burn, and has plenty of power.  The only minor comment is that it&#x27;s a tad heavy, likely due to the dual ceramic/ionic build of these hairdryers.  Perhaps it&#x27;ll be lighter in the next gen models but then again, maybe it&#x27;ll serve as a good workout.      I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s very, very happy. Works for me since she complained about the portable/foldable conair model we had for the past year.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a professional dryer so I can not compare to that, BUT for the PRICE of this one it works great!! It&#x27;s heavy but not bothersome to me. It drys my hair quickly about 5 minutes and I have thick long hair. Plenty of heat and power! For now I&#x27;d buy this again, but would upgrade someday to a chi.</li>
    <li> We live in an area where the water is extremely hard, leaving my hair dry and brittle after washing. I was initially skeptical that a $35 hair dryer could make a difference, but I noticed immediately that my hair was  softer, shinier and laid down much better and was easier to style after using this hair dryer. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My hair is long, and very course and thick.  It normally has taken about a half hour to dry.  At my hairdresser&#x27;s, she had a dryer that would get my hair dry pretty quickly.  When I asked, she explained it was a tourmaline dryer, and the cost was $350-400!  Well, I couldn&#x27;t afford that and came online to search for something affordable for me.  When I saw the reviews on this product, I thought maybe it might be helpful and decided to give it a try.  Total RAVE, my hair was dry to the root in under 10 minutes!  This is one of those finds you just have to pass along, it&#x27;s such a time saver, and it&#x27;s very affordable.  Don&#x27;t miss it!</li>
    <li> As far as how it works, it does a grand job,,,, BUT&lt;br /&gt;after a few years the rubber part of the handle becomes very gummy and leaves a residue on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Its not from being used because its only used about ever 2 or 3 months.</li>
    <li> It is just ok. Nothing special. Like any other blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I lost the little cap...Dont&#x27; know where to buy the substitute.&lt;br /&gt;The technology it says it has....Whatever...Like any other dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy ladies...enjoy.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works fine (pretty standard...no complaints), but the diffuser doesn&#x27;t really work well on my hair.  It takes FOREVER to dry and only looks OK at the end.  Maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong products, but I can never get diffusers to work well on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is ok. Doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot hot just warm. Also, a bit on the heavy side. It does not have a retractable cord either, which is a feature that will be a \\&quot;must\\&quot; on my future dryer.</li>
    <li> This product is great but make sure to use the attachments, because they do help you achieve what you want, I used to like using the diffuser attachment to dry my hair but keep it curly. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it but after I lost it, I bought a smaller dryer for travel purposes and just used that one from then on. It&#x27;s pretty good, but large for traveling if you do that a lot. Again though, this one&#x27;s a great dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for almost a year now, and it has worked great. I did not find it to be too heavy as some of the other reviewers said. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4, 125lbs, and raising this one-handed to blow dry my hair has not been an issue. I also found that the cord was a reasonable length (not too long.)</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old hair dryer was starting to smell bad every time i used it, the good thing about this one is that you can open the filter in the back to clean it. Also I&#x27;ve never used the pronged thingy before to dry my hair but I use it now every time for an even dry all over, great product and exactly as described</li>
    <li> good value&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;not too heavy  long lead&lt;br /&gt;proffesional finish achievable&lt;br /&gt;great for all hair lengths&lt;br /&gt;powerful quickly</li>
</ol>
