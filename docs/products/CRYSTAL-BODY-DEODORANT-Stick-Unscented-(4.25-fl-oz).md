      <li>but this one is better and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>comes in a roll on and with scent if you prefer more variety.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The travel size is perfect for travel or daily use.</li>
      <li>Being odorless means it does not have a fragrance which will attract bugs like most deodorants.</li>
      <li>Airline safe.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
      <li>so cost wise it seems like a good value based on the local price that I paid (under $5).&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this works, which is really impressive. I expect this stick to last me absolutely forever, as well.</li>
    <li> Have used for about a week.  I&#x27;m surprised by how well it works and how well it kept body odor in check.  I tried once before but wasn&#x27;t aware you have to wet the stone before application.  DUH!  So happy to not be putting chemical onto my lymph nodes:)</li>
    <li> Ordered by mistake and will only use this type when we run out of the roll-on deodorant.</li>
    <li> Better size than the large ones sold in our local stores. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Usually use the spray version of this at home. Since the spray bottles exceed TSA liquid restrictions this travel stick is the perfect alternative when I travel.</li>
    <li> Received the shipment prompty. Wow- this product works very well and I have ordered more so I can send to family. i will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the aluminum contained in solid regular deodorants, and I absolutely hate the scents added to gel deodorants. The crystal stick is, so far, the best form of deodorant I&#x27;ve found for my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the design of this stick kind of sucks. I&#x27;ve never had a Crystal product that didn&#x27;t fall out of its container within a couple weeks of use. I know that&#x27;s a hard issue to address, since crystal sticks are basically big lumps of mineral salt that slowly dissolve in water, but still. Expoxy it onto the base or something, I&#x27;m sick of my deodorant turning into a slippery lump of rock salt when used more than 5 times.</li>
    <li> Works great as a deodorant. I used this travel size with success for weeks and then bought the full size crystal. Full size failed me in every way.  Sweat and stink.  So I&#x27;m back to the travel size. This small size lasts much longer than any conventional deodorant.  Antiperspirant qualities: even though it makes no claims  to be such, I think it sill helps somewhat. Regular deodorants clogged my pores and seemed to make me sweat even more. I have perspired wearing this, but it seems to be less than with regular deodorant/antiperspirants.  Have been using this for about a month and a half.</li>
    <li> These things seem to last forever until you drop them and they shatter. I tend to buy the smaller ones because I will eventually drop them. Plus, I pack them for travel - no TSA hassles with these.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but tried it because it was cheap and because there was a chance that I&#x27;d quit staining my shirts. As others have said, IT WORKS. I believe that it changes the pH, making the armpit area unsuitable for the bacteria that stink and stain. I still sweat at times, but I have yet to ruin a shirt since I started using this product 6 months ago. I&#x27;ve also not come close to getting through my first stick, so it&#x27;s also very cost effective. Excellent!</li>
    <li> It must be me because everyone else seems to love this product. I followed the application directions and it did not work for me. I had the same result as if I had not used any deodorant. It is also very heavy for its size. I want a small and light unscented travel sized deodorant. I will use my current unscented deodorant for travel. It is slightly larger but it is also much lighter.</li>
    <li> After using this spray and the regular crystal deoderant I can nevr go back to regular sticks. It takes about a week for your body to get used to but don&#x27;t give up. After a week your body stops having any odor where you spray this. It&#x27;s like magic. Best of all these products do not have the cancer causing ingreadients that all other standard deodorants have. Plus you&#x27;ll never again have a painful blocked sweat pore. These all natural products rock!</li>
    <li> I use this natural deodorant daily and it works for me all year long. It is very affordable for me to use and I love the small travel size and the price is cheap!</li>
    <li> I got it to try it, but did not like the sticky feeling post use. Ended up disposing it after a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. The small size is great as I just put it in my make up bag when i travel. I haven&#x27;t worn chemical laden deodorant/antiperspirant in at least three months and no one knows the difference. I just put this on when I am still wet exiting the shower and I am good to go even in the most humid Texas weather.</li>
    <li> Great size for travel.  Deodorant works without any chemicals; thankful for this product!</li>
    <li> I use these in the shower. Normally I use the full-sized stones, but sometimes I got curious and ordered the small ones, as the stones last so friggin&#x27; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the small ones work, and as the rock is attached to the base directly, instead of a roll-out mechanism, it&#x27;s built the way I like my full-size ones built. These things do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is a piece of cake to accidentally knock this thing off a shower shelf, as it is so top-heavy. Over half of the times these things accidentally fall, in my experience, they shatter.</li>
    <li> Works way better than I expected! I try to avoid aluminum deodorant, but haven&#x27;t had much success at eliminating all oder with other options until this one.  Still need something strong for intense, hot, active days, but use this as an every day deodorant and love it!</li>
    <li> Great for travel and non scented.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and it keeps my body odor from offending others.  Recently, I sweated through my t-shirt and my under-arms were visibly soaked, but I did not stink.    I noticed that my underarms have to be thoroughly cleaned before rubbing the crystal stone on them, so I do so after taking a shower and using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, and while my underarms are still wet, before drying off with a towel.  If I wait a little bit after the shower, and bacteria have a chance to thrive before putting the stick on, it will not protect.    I am concerned that there is Alum in this product.  I am concerned that aluminum atoms could escape from the molecule and be absorbed by the body, directly in to the lymph nodes that are located in the arm-pits.  The notion that we ingest traces of aluminum every day, and therefore, any aluminum absorbed from the arm-pits is negligable is fallacy.  Our intestinal lining is very selective.  It rushes out poisons, in the form of diarrhea, and absorbes nutriants.  The intestinal lining is inately intelligent and designed for this purpose.  Human&#x27;s were not designed to ingest selectively, foods or poisons, through their under-arms.  Lymph node tissue is not the same as intestinal lining, therefore, to quote that it&#x27;s unessissary to do an absorption analysis, based on the fact that we eat/drink aluminum every day, is misleading.    Read [...] FAQ and see for yourself how misleading it is.  I&#x27;d like to see all tests completed, including some using lab mice, and no one better tell me that a lab mice&#x27;s physical health is more important than a human being&#x27;s.  I want a deodorant that works, AND is certain not to harm, and this crystal just has not convinced me that it is safe.  If anyone else knows of a better product, you&#x27;re welcome to let me know moc.oohay ta llllneerg &lt;-backwards    \\&quot;Our data shows that molecules of alum are too large to be absorbed through the skin and in any case, even if it were possible for alum moleculesto be absorbed into the skin, such amounts would be inconsequential in daily use.  According to a study of our deodorant properties by Aigner McLaughlin Associates, an independent testing, consulting and research lab based in Portland, OR (please note that this study was not commissioned by Crystal(tm) but, instead, by one of our customers), it is not meaningful to conduct an absorption test because the possibility of absorption of aluminum ions through the skin \\&quot;is miniscule compared to everyday intake through food, water (and inhalation), thus making any analysis data statistically insignificant.\\&quot;  We believe in the absolute safety of Crystal(tm) deodorants.\\&quot; from [...] FAQ    In the meantime, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, simply because it seems like the best of the bunch so far.  I like that it lets me sweat, and it does not have awful smelling chemical fragrances added.</li>
    <li> Super product. Won&#x27;t ever switch back to commercial brands.</li>
    <li> Shipping was timely. Product works great. Just like its big brother</li>
    <li> I prefer the larger size, but this is ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> I will probably never use another deodorant. This is what I have been looking for my whole life, as far as a deodorant goes. It is perfect.</li>
    <li> The total best. I used alum from  west africa from age 11 to 16. Moved to america. 5 years later, this rocks. This is the exactly the same best. Pure and simple. NO stinky in my armpit, not nasty smell with no shower in Houston Texas summer heat for up to two days. The best deodorant . I&#x27;m not going back to drugstore deodorant ever.</li>
    <li> For 20 years, I had been struggling with bad body odor problem until I found this product. This product really change my life and improves my confidence. I had been embarrassed and have low self esteem. Sometimes, I do not dare to raise my arm due to the fear my colleagues will smell my odor. Yes it is that bad! While it is a good product, it is not an instant solution that many people hoped for, meaning you have to clean your armpit first for it to work. If you already perspired and think that applying it will help you, you are wrong. It is not the way crystal deodorant works. It needs to be applied on a clean surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I experiment with it and come up with my own routine for applying this. My routine: Shower in the morning, including washing my armpit with shower foam. After showering, I will dry myself except for my armpit. The reason is that moisture is needed for an effective application. Then I will rub the crystal on my armpit about 12 to 15 times. Put on my clothes and I am done! It last throughout the day even after heavy gym sessions, until I take a shower at night. As all our lifestyles are all different, it is up to you to find the most effective way or day of the time to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the travel stick version and is very portable considering it&#x27;s small size. The crystal stick will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly, Amazon&#x27;s price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> Unlike the Crystal spray, rock and regular deodorant stick, this version is very easy to handle and will have fewer &#x27;mechanical&#x27; issues (like getting plugged or stuck). This is my new go-to version of this reliable, no-scent deodorant.</li>
    <li> Works exceptionally well, and small enough to travel with.</li>
    <li> I usually use this just before using my antiperspirant/deodorant. I know it&#x27;s meant to be its own deodorant, but I do not find that it works too well when used alone. I do think that when used with my my regular deodorant it helps keep  me fresher all day - reduces that mid-day sweat/perfume mix. I do not sweat a lot, but am really sensitive to feeling fresh all day and the Crystal does help some.</li>
    <li> Love the subscribe and save feature!  Wife loves it.  Once you start using it though you need to keep using it or the bacteria come back with a vengeance lol.</li>
    <li> great for travelling, small but effective.</li>
    <li> I use the regular size so bought this to take on a trip.  It&#x27;s works really well as a deodorant.  Just know this is small and can be slippery when it gets wet.</li>
    <li> This is a great stocking stuffer for the Boy Scout or Back Packer.  It is very small, will last for months, and is odorless.  Being odorless means it does not have a fragrance which will attract bugs like most deodorants.</li>
    <li> finally a natural safe deodorant to use- and WORKS!!! i was using toms for the past couple years and it really wasn&#x27;t working. my sister told me about this product and i thought i would give it a try. though skeptical … WOW!!! ITS FANTASTIC!!! works great- so easy to use. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smaller than the regular size at local stores. Great for travel and locker rooms!</li>
    <li> Great product! I started using this to get away from chemical deodorants. This deodorant is a bit more time-consuming to use, as it has to be wet when applied. It also takes a minute or so to dry, so you have to watch rubbing the salt off on your clothes (and making the application process pointless). But it works well for crystal deodorant. I would have to reapply during the day, but as long as I&#x27;m not working out, this is a good deodorant.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyplace on your body, esp feet!!!</li>
    <li> When my Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and her surgeon told her she can never wear anti-persperant again, I decided to take the warnings about aluminum in anti-persperant seriously and look for an alternative. I tried several deoderants before finding Crystal Body deoderant, and none of them worked more than a few hours. But Crystal Body deoderant works well beyond the 24 hours they claim. I often go running late the following morning, more than 24 hours after using Crystal stick, and still have no underarm odor. You wet the stick to apply and wait for it to dry, and it feels just like water. There is no film, scent, or flaking. You don&#x27;t even know you have it on. But it works amazingly well, better than any deoderant I have used. According to the online research I did, the alum salts are too big to pass through your pores, unlike the aluminum products contained in anti-persperants. I know there is controversy over whether this is a cause of breast cancer, but if there is even a question, why take a chance when there is such a great alternative?</li>
    <li> If you like this type of deodorant then you will like this one for the reason I bought it.  It is very small with little wasted packaging.  The stick is smaller but should function for well over a year, I have had mine for 3!  And unlike the bigger ones, this one travels nicely.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this brand, I bought from others and I regret cause some were only a little cheaper but this one is better and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I can atest as someone who still smells with a low quality deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;this is the only thing that really solves my case.&lt;br /&gt;There are no cons at all.</li>
    <li> This is a small size in a plastic case that is great for the gym bag or traveling.  There is also a large size that is great for leaving on the sink next to the shower at home.  Keep a good grip on that one because it gets SLIPPERY when wet!  They are the same material and same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t stink terribly (at least I don&#x27;t think so), but I work out a lot (every day) and it&#x27;s pretty hot in my area (Los Angeles) so I do get body odor.  What I HATED was scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing in the shower and STILL stinking right after a shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure &amp;#34;deodorants&amp;#34; try to HIDE your smell with some other smell.  Not a great game plan in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am GLAD I found this.  This attacks the PROBLEM, it does not try to hide it.  This stuff KILLS the little microbes living on your skin that make the bad smells!  (Don&#x27;t freak out - yes your body is home to billions of microbes - on your skin, hair, inside your mouth, gut, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after EVERY shower (make it DAILY!), wet the rock with regular water, then just wipe it around under your arms (and other stinky areas like feet, etc.) and then get dressed.  That&#x27;s it.  The rock is really a type of salt and the salt starts to kill the microbes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries very quickly (faster than I can walk from bathroom to closet).  NO white residue.  NO smell.  NO stickiness.  NO &amp;#34;zebra stripes&amp;#34; on black shirts.  NO runny liquid.  (I haven&#x27;t licked myself to see if there is any taste.  Any volunteers?  JK)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t happen immediately.  You have to keep up the routine for 2-3 days until you see big changes.  You might be pulling off your Tshirt and notice, HEY I DON&#x27;T STINK!!  Just use it regularly.  The key is shower and use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you STOP showering and using the rock daily (say, during your annual buddy backpack trip), your smells will creep back.  Just re-start your daily shower and rock, in a few days you&#x27;ll be smelling like -- NOTHING!:)</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you see on the shelf and you think...what the?? And then you pick up that roll on or that speed stick and forget about the crystal. But then you get that painful underarm rash or you stain your clothes...or worse..you still smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well my friends...I&#x27;ve been there and done that too. I said...crystal..what crystal...I don&#x27;t need a stinking crystal. But I was wrong...I did need this crystal and for the past 5 years it&#x27;s all that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last forever, they don&#x27;t smell, there&#x27;s no mess, there&#x27;s no aluminum garbage that may or may not cause you problems, and best of all there&#x27;s no rash and I don&#x27;t stink anymore (subject to independent verification).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I really can&#x27;t imagine a person wanting to use the other products after trying the crystal. These things work and they work well. It&#x27;s really amazing how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get yourself one and try it out. Before long you&#x27;ll be writing one of these reviews too.</li>
    <li> Depended on this deodorant during this summer&#x27;s hot and muggy Missouri and Texas travels and it never let me down once :)</li>
    <li> This still does not work for me even twenty years later.  I thought maybe I&#x27;d try this again, but I didn&#x27;t have any better success than when I was in High School.  I have heard it does work for some people.</li>
    <li> there is absolutely nothing negative to be said about this product.  It really works.   Its clean.   Completely fragrance free.  Practical.  Airline safe. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothes.   Get some.</li>
    <li> Even after following the instructions on the deodorant, I found that it did not go on smoothly and it did not do a great job at offering 24 hr odor protection.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it....I tried this product for 2 weeks...what a mistske...burned the heck out of my armpits. They were red , irritated for 2 weeks after use. Lots of stinging and discomfort.  I don&#x27;t know how it works for others. NO I WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried... even better than prescription strength stuff.</li>
    <li> So far this works.  There is no white powder on my shirts.  It is a healthier alternative to the aluminum in deodorant.  If i remember i will update later to inform about the longevity of this product.  But so far, I like it!!!!</li>
    <li> The best deodorant.  The travel size is perfect for travel or daily use.</li>
    <li> So tiny, you won&#x27;t believe it!</li>
    <li> excellent item, solved my problem</li>
    <li> Goes on dry, so I keep this one in my car to put on once I start sweating a bit. It works great as that, and would be a 5, because it dries me right up. It didn&#x27;t work for me putting it on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Worked well until I started having hot flashes.  Clearly not a menopause friendly product.:)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried this yet, but it is fragrance free and aluminum free, so I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
    <li> many years such use deodorant . if you can not go to Thailand and there to buy, ordering here. (Thai better)</li>
    <li> My husband likes this. I lasts months, is inexpensive, and no bad chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;I like it in spray form.</li>
    <li> After trying multiple natural deodorants, I was skeptical that there was really one out there that would work. While this is not the most enjoyable product to put on (it kind of pulls upon the skin upon application, even when properly wet), it lasts all day and has no overpowering odors or toxic chemicals to contend with.</li>
    <li> I used to have to change deodorants before they were finished becouse they would only prevent smell for a few weeks and then just loose their effect. I&#x27;ve been usin crystal for 3 years now. Plus points for making the skin under my arms lighter.</li>
    <li> Too small to use easily.  It was a  mistake to buy this size.  The product is fine but it is just toooooo small.</li>
    <li> I used it for almost 2 weeks and it was just like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything. I smelled like BO. Waste of money! Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Well I really enjoyed this thing, actively recommended it to friends (even though &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve GOT to try this deodorant&amp;#34; sounds like kind of a random/weird excitement) and whatnot, until the rock snapped off the base under extremely tame circumstances. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Travel Stick&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t travel with it, let alone keep it in a gym bag or whatever else. It just sat on my bathroom sink, was used once a day, and after about a week it just broke off. And now that it&#x27;s off, well I have no idea how to reattach it and using glue hasn&#x27;t worked so far, so while I&#x27;d give it a 5 I have to knock it a few points for that. From what I understand not many other people have had this problem, so this might be a fluke, but the ease with which it snapped off makes me very skeptical that it could be such a rare occurrence.</li>
    <li> Works for some but not for others. Inexpensive enough for you to give a try.</li>
    <li> Ever since I switched to more natural products a few years ago, I was in search of an efficient natural deodorant. I tried several brands, but wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the results. I was very tempted to try to make my own deodorant, but most recipes use coconut oil and I thought it would be greasy and stain my clothes, so I abandoned the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about Crystal a long time ago, but for some reason never purchased one until recently. I decided to go with the travel-size one (1.5 oz) to make sure I like it. Besides, the small size makes it easy to carry around in your purse or travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid pretty much the same price in store for this product, so don&#x27;t hesitate to order it from Amazon. It is a really good price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for three months, I can say that the product really works. I don&#x27;t sweat a lot (as in not a lot of moisture), but there is a certain smell that of course, bothers me. After applying this product, not only there is no moisture, but there is also no smell whatsoever. I have been exercising every morning, including walking up a big hill in my neighborhood, which is exhausting. I decided to exercise without putting on any deodorant and I did sweat a bit and there was quite a bit of armpit moisture. But whenever I apply the deodorant, I stay dry and there is no smell. I keep checking myself and cannot believe how efficient it is. I purchased a second one for my husband and it works just as good on him, with the exception that there is more moisture in his situation (he is a big guy though), but still, no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel-size product is not a roll-on. It is basically a big stick of salt, stuck in the plastic container. I was a bit concerned at the beginning, that the stick might fall after a while, but it seems to stay in place very well. The product has no smell and it has a very smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crystal stone comes from Thailand and is made from natural mineral salts. The salt keeps the bacteria in your armpits from releasing the unpleasant smell. It is hypoallergenic, vegan and contains no other ingredients than Ammonium Alum. There is a huge difference between Ammonium Alum and Aluminum Chloride/Chlorohydrate/Zirconium (toxic aluminums found in most deodorants). The toxic aluminum blocks your sweat ducts and glands and this is why it keeps you dry. But by doing so, they also prevent the body from naturally expelling toxins through sweat. They also absorb very easily into your skin and blood, which is obviously not good. Ammonium Alum, on the other hand, is not absorbed through the skin. Instead, it stays on the surface of the skin where it prevents the bacteria (responsible for causing B.O.) from multiplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not write about how to apply the product, since I noticed most reviews have already mentioned it. I do find that it dries very fast, which is another plus, since I don&#x27;t have to wait around waving my arms for minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure not to leave the deodorant on granite or marble countertops, since it might cause discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product might be small, but you only use very little each time and it will last for months.lts.

    <li> This works amazingly well , my husband sweats a lot and using this he has NO body odor at the end of the day. I&#x27;m not convinced the aluminum salt in it won&#x27;t get into the body, but I&#x27;ll take this for him over the expesnive natural scented ones that just mask odor.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I was hoping I could get away from chemical ridden deodorants but I developed a painful rash that was explained to me as somewhat of a yeast infection from not using an antiperspirant. I wish my body could have adjusted, but it was just too painful in the Florida heat.</li>
    <li> Like it works great , I tried the Crystal because it is all natural wanted to get away from all the chemicals. So far very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I like it! Very nice deodorant!</li>
    <li> Was looking for these locally on and off for months. Finally thought to buy them online - appreciating Amazon&#x27;s wide selection and availability. Already used the crystal for a decade - just needed a lighter weight version. In fact, I bought 2. all good.</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable.  It was purchased for my girlfriend who went through breast surgery due to cancer and had to use special deodorants.  This product is very effective, easy to use, lasts a very long time and it is recommended for cancer patients due to its lack of ingredients that are harmful for people who have had chemo, radiation or are taking drugs due to their cancer.  I have started using it myself as well and I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering buying it.</li>
    <li> It last a long time it really works</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try this but having a very active young boy I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;From the 2nd day I started noticing the difference, no more sweaty clothes or strong smells.</li>
    <li> This is working very well to my surprise.  It is winter time, so no real test for it yet.  There is no fragrance, so no smell of any kind when I put it on and it seems to be doing its job.  Yes, I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my gym bag and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and it doesn&#x27;t even look like its gone down much.  And I put it on every weekday so it&#x27;s really lasting.  There is no issue of it staining my clothes and that is the best part.</li>
    <li> Used Crystal deodorant for over 20 years, great product.  When traveling the standard size container is cumbersome and can get broken.  This &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; is absolutely perfect!  Small size packs well, only takes a couple extra seconds to use with the smaller applicator area.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she seems to be very pleased with the results of the product actually working as a BO deodorizer</li>
    <li> I have used these deodorant sticks for years. I bought this one to use at home.  It is plenty big and lasts forever.  It does nothing for perspiration but can keep me odor free in the worst summer weather even while doing strenuous outdoor activities.  It makes me so happy to save money and my health at the same time. No clothes stains either! This is one of those products I cannot live without.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I don&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> First natural I tried and it&#x27;s strange because you wet it and put it on but really loved how it worked and that there was no strange natural scent.</li>
    <li> Garbage. It is listed as ammonium alum, which works, in the picture, but mine says potassium alum, and it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients. The product is not good. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the metal in regular deodorant and I&#x27;ve found this to work well as a substitute.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, had high hopes, and gave it a shot on a weekday in the office. I stunk by 11:00 AM. Badly. Like roadkill. From sitting in front of a computer. Real deodorant keeps me BO-free till dinner time, at least - usually till bed time. I&#x27;m a normal man, 31 years old, no particular BO issues. I have started getting a rash from using the same deodorants for a long time - first Old Spice, then Degree. Based on my research, it&#x27;s probably fragrance-related, so I bought a few fragrance-free options to try them out. I couldn&#x27;t care less about being &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; as if &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mercury is good for you and &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; processed tofu is bad for you. I prefer to use my head. Still, I&#x27;d appreciate a chunk of mineral that&#x27;s cheap and long lasting. It doesn&#x27;t work, though.&lt;br /&gt;I will grant that Crystal Body Deodorant is better than no deodorant. If I forget to put anything on, I will notice the smell in a few hours, at most. Hence this stuff gets two stars for lasting 3 or 4 hours in a boring office.&lt;br /&gt;I really think the people who say this works great are like my girlfriend - they don&#x27;t even need deodorant in the first place! If you have normal dude BO but need to avoid fragrance, try Almay unscented. It was the winner of my little comparison by a country mile. Tom&#x27;s was next - better than Crystal, but not near as effective as the Almay.</li>
    <li> The travel-sized version of this deodorant in particular make a great deal of sense considering how long a full-size will last and that if you&#x27;re not careful you can &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; them (but often still use them, though sometimes not). I use this for travel and also in my purse for a touch up because this product DOES work but it isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant/miracle worker so if I&#x27;m especially harried or if it&#x27;s sticky weather, this mini is really helpful midday. Also, this too will last for months and months and months!</li>
    <li> Yes, this is it.  THE classic natural deodorant stick.  Nice travel size.  So consider it an essential.</li>
    <li> It take a little to get used to if you are accustomed to your solids, gels and roll-on. It feels like it&#x27;s doing nothing but it lets me sweat (which is normal) without my pits stinking. These things last forever easily a year if not more. I want to give these thing away to hipsters who don&#x27;t understand the concept of grooming and showering.</li>
    <li> Great to deter odor. Make note that u have to put it on when your pits are clean or doesn&#x27;t really work. You also have to wet the rock or your pits to make application easy. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for wetness but definitely helps with odor so it is as advertised, a deodorant. The plastic that holds the rock in place cracked on the travel size version but a little duck tape has solved the problem.</li>
    <li> In my opinion---*THE* BEST deodorant for those that are allergic, get itchy under arms with regular deodorants, as well for those that do not want to have chemicals seeping into their pores.&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do with this deodorant BEFORE you put it on, is----put it UNDER the running water ( sink faucet water) for 1 second and you are ready to put in on. Rub it under your EACH underarms for about 15 seconds. You will be ready to go for the entire day and night!&lt;br /&gt;These deodorants do not have the chemicals many deodorants have. When I say this is THE BEST . I mean it.&lt;br /&gt; I wish I&#x27;d known of these Crystal deodorants years ago. Words cannot describe how great these are. I know...I know ...the company should pay me for being their spokesperson, the way I go about this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been avoiding aluminum-based antiperspirant deodorants for years now. My staple is Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant, Unscented but I like to alternate products so I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick, Unscented. Recently, I added Crystal to the rotation and it is the most effective of all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d even say it acts as an antiperspirant. I started with a 4.5oz stick but bought this 1.5oz size for travel. I&#x27;ve gone through multiple sticks of the other products and barely made a dent in the Crystal so do not hesitate because of the size. 1.5oz will last a year, buy the multipack and share with family.</li>
    <li> I have been using crystal deodorant for a few months now. I love that it has no residue to get onto my clothes and no scent. I was skeptical at first as to how a &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; could work as a deodorant, but I have had no complaints that I smell so far, so I assume it is working!</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been searching for organic/natural deodorant and stumbled on this one. It&#x27;s hard to describe really. This is travel size, about 2.5 inches.  But I think it will last forever. It&#x27;s hard...you run it under some water and then apply to underarms. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you leave anything on your skin. No fragrance. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now. No issues so far! By the end of the day,mi may be a little less than fresh. That&#x27;s on 90 degree weather. I was on a hurry the other day and grabbed my old Degree. I noticed by the end of the morning, I was sweating and less than fresh smelling. It was only in the 70s here that day. Crystal was definitely better! Try it!</li>
    <li> For me it only works for a day, but it works great.</li>
    <li> This item is small enough to fit in your toiletry bag, backpack or purse. Comes in its own case. The product will not keep the user from perspiring. Nice stocking stuffer. I have given this item as a gift. Would recommend for friend or family to purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant and have not used anything else since a friend turned me on to it years ago.  One Crystal stick will last a year or two.  This is the only stuff that holds me even after heavy sweating of exercising or chores such as mowing grass.  It has never irritated my underarm, is clear, does not stain, and I feel good about no chemicals after a family member suffered breast cancer.  This stuff is great.  Just leave your underarms wet from the shower and it glides and dries right on.  Will never use anything else and I save a ton of money on other deodorants that do not last long.  This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best natural deodorant. I have tried a few of these and I could not be more pleased with the performance of the product. I don&#x27;t know if it is just my pH or what but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No clumpy build up&lt;br /&gt;No stink&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> This crystal salt is simply amazing, I can&#x27;t believe that it holds me all day and after exercising.  I&#x27;m having hot flashes during the day on top of it being hot and exercising in the evening.  I can&#x27;t believe there is not body ordor after all of this.  However, I choose to try this product because I&#x27;m not using deordorants that contain aluminum, this one hints of having some alum?  What ever that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this product and after some more research as to the ingredients I will be purchaing a much larger quanity.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, but was a perfect choice in size to try. Got to try a product without coming out of pocket too much.</li>
    <li> Frankly I purchased this about a year ago (and for less at my local store) but did not use it more than a couple times before going back to my usual deodorant (secret). I recently went on vacation and left my deo in my carryon which wasn&#x27;t in the bathroom... after my shower I applied the crystal product and was pleasantly surprised. I like that it has no smell, no chemicals, seems to work quite well. So I have used it for a couple weeks now after every shower and I think I&#x27;ll be sticking to it. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cake\\&quot; up on my pits like traditional deodorant lol. Also it seems like its going to last a LONG time so cost wise it seems like a good value based on the local price that I paid (under $5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try if you want something more natural that works.</li>
    <li> To make sure this works 100%, you have to atleast try the following steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean your armpit before applying the rock. (Baking Soda paste or soap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Run warm/hot water on the rock to get it nice and melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply a GREAT amount of the rock onto your armpits. Keep rubbing it onto your pits to make sure that salt shield will protect you the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Usually this process will take about 1-2 minutes on both pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Let your pits air dry if they are still moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wala! You are ready for the day!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better if you keep your arms up once in a while to avoid massive sweating since this is not an anti-perspiration.</li>
    <li> It really works and fits in a small pursue. This is the only brand that truly works. I have it in every size and version.</li>
    <li> Nice size crystal, well packaged. Received far sooner than promised.</li>
    <li> Convenient travel size of a great alternative product.</li>
    <li> I like the travel stick better than the other style which is just a rock you use.  I like the deoderant overall and use it daily but I do find that it sometimes isn&#x27;t good enough for moderate/heavy sweat.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these two years ago for my husband because he was trying to stay away from aluminum and we were both sick of replacing his white undershirts every 6 months because of the antiperspirant stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is that original travel size crystal still around but the whole family is a believer. These things really work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you will still sweat (like you should) but it doesn&#x27;t smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to use it right after your shower wet it and rinse it after use.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Work much better than the old chemical products I&#x27;ve used all these years.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a stick of salt would keep me from being a smelly mess, but this stuff actually works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month straight with no side effects or BO. Will buy another if this ever wears out.</li>
    <li> Worked really well at first, but then the stick got smelly and nothing I did would take the mildew smell away.</li>
    <li> I love this little salt stick - it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone...it makes my husbands arm pits a bit raw.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s small - travels well and if I do drop it - at least it wasn&#x27;t a huge one. I purchased several as back up.&lt;br /&gt;With the junk in deodorants I&#x27;m very happy to use this + it lasts for EVER!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading in multiple places that using it on your face could clear your skin, so that&#x27;s what this review is for. It did NOT work as a skin product for me, in fact it made me break out pretty significantly. My skin got better almost immediately when I stopped using it. For that purpose, it gets zero stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fine deodorant, though, if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for, so I gave it 3 stars for that (on the benefit of the doubt; I never actually used it as a deodorant, because I prefer a product that also contains an antiperspirant.)</li>
    <li> works well.. it did take a few days to get used to, but after that its like using anything.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Unscented and works surprisingly well. I am pregnant so I wanted to get away from toxins.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted -- a cute, lightweight, convenient version of the larger crystal roll-on I keep in the cabinet.  This one is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this product works for me. I like that I no longer have the waxy parabens on my skin. The small size of this one is a good travel size.</li>
    <li> I tried this Crystal Body Deodorant Travel Stick, specifically because I was looking for easier products to take along while traveling and was also hoping to minimize liquids in my bag.  I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical as to how effective it would be.  I even had one I bought in Thailand a year before but never tried because it seemed to good to be true.  But let me tell you, I am sold on this product and am a user for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remained odor-free all though out my week long visit to humid New Orleans in September.&lt;br /&gt;Non liquid - great for travel, won&#x27;t spill in your bag and allows more space for you 3-1-1!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts and lasts and lasts!  Have been using mine for 3 months and it barely looks used.&lt;br /&gt;No toxic chemicals or aluminum&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free for those with allergies or sensitivities&lt;br /&gt;Also comes in a roll on and with scent if you prefer more variety.&lt;br /&gt;No stains or white marks on your clothes&lt;br /&gt;For men, no clotting in your underarm hair.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful addition to your green products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very slight bit of moisture, but I hesitate to even write this because it should not be enough to sway you from using the Crystal Body Deodorant stick.  However, it is not labeled as an antiperspirant anyway and it is actually healthier to allow your body this natural process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, I Love that this is a natural product as it is very important to me to use as many green products as possible.  Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been missing out on this for so many years!  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Its working!!  I sweat... I just dont smell!</li>
    <li> I switched entirely to Crystal deodorant a few years ago. At first I felt like I got really great results with it. Then I noticed it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for when I exercised. (I&#x27;ve let it slide since I moved to a town where I didn&#x27;t have a gym, and I did all my workouts alone, anyway!) When I moved to a tropical climate, it didn&#x27;t even get me through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it works best when I don&#x27;t do a lot of sweating. I still haven&#x27;t used traditional deodorant, but I am more careful about reapplying this (or, more often, even washing and reapplying) part way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this on an average day, but I&#x27;m also ready to start trying some alternatives.</li>
    <li> I bought this for backpacking. Regular deodorants barely work after 12 hours of hard walking.... But some work well if you reapply often. On the other hand i didnt want to be the only thing in the woods that smells like rainbows and sunshine (bear magnet....) so i tried this deodorant stick.    Ive used it for 1 week now. I apply it after my morning shower, just once a day. I have backpacked 5 miles 1 day, 9 miles another and 6 miles another day. The other 4 days since i started using it were spent lounging around. I havent had any underarm body odor all week. Even after the 9 mile day of hiking with 40lbs on my back, not a single scent. Its weird because there is zero scent at all.    I dont know how this is going to work when im hiking 20 miles a day for 5 months straight, but so far its been working much better than i expected.</li>
    <li> This is high maintenance and not worth it considering I can get better results for a lot less hassle with Waleda&#x27;s Rose Deodorant. That one comes in a spray bottle and smells of roses (no stench, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t linger) - the one downside would be the alcohol content, which is high. It hasn&#x27;t had any bad effects on me, however, and I infinitely prefer it to having to babysit this crystal, make sure I rewet it to apply generously, then leave it to dry completely, and generally have to rush around to make sure I get this on ASAP after my shower.</li>
    <li> Crystal Travel Stick is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s effective and has no fragrance or unnecessary chemicals.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel because it&#x27;s not a liquid.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that every stick I&#x27;ve bought breaks off before it&#x27;s completely used.  I continue to use the piece without the base, but it&#x27;s less convenient that way.</li>
    <li> this kills ob, but does not last all day. I would have to reapply it about once an hour. I like that it&#x27;s clean and a healthier choice.</li>
    <li> I like it but pls do not separate my order to several parts!!tks!!</li>
