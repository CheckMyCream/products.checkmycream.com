### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was very happy with this product even though I didnt care for the brush</li>
      <li>This stuff blends perfectly - very handy when I&#x27;m overdue to go for a color touch-up but just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and wash out, perfect for touchups.</li>
      <li>My scalp was bright orange.</li>
      <li>I liked Masc-A-Gray Hair Mascara much better (and have a review there) and ended up buying two until I found my best color.</li>
      <li>Got it, it looked good, but I tried to get some powder onto the brush</li>
      <li>GREAT coverage because the pigmentation is just over the top good.  </li>
      <li>love the applicator and the product!  </li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>Dumped a bunch more on my rug and floor!  </li>
      <li>This Jonathan product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if they&#x27;d offer a combo - like an auburn color.</li>
      <li>great stuff, the red was perfect for</li>
      <li>If it was the right color and had a more managable brush- itd be great!</li>
      <li>Just very lightly touch hair, NOT your scalp.  </li>
      <li>Color was more orange than amber.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>That worked much better than the &amp;#34;dumping&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It clings to hair and easily brushes off skin.  </li>
      <li>This really is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>Far too bright.</li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>Wow I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product was shipped fast and packaged appropriately.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all.  </li>
      <li>I ended up using my eyebrow brush to dip into the color very lightly and gently apply it to gray hair areas around my face where the color always washes/fades out first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply too much, but the learning curve is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not for the deep red but for copper or even ginger hair it would be great</li>
      <li>I review MANY products of this type on my social media</li>
      <li>will be posting a video review on this product for anyone interested that wants to actually SEE  the results with their own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Then I bought another tube of the same color, just in case they stop making it, which sometimes happens with things I love.</li>
      <li>it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try using an eyeshadow brush to apply the powder, and see it that works any better.</li>
      <li>It is very red which is nice if you have red hair as I&#x27;ve found most products labeld red are more brown than red.  </li>
      <li>(OK, I admit, the 2nd one was more than a little &amp;#34;stupid user error.&amp;#34;)  </li>
      <li>The color itself matches my hair very well, and helps to conceal well between salon visits.  </li>
      <li>u really have to work in the powder</li>
      <li>So much for my experiment...</li>
      <li>After a while it actually did blend in to my own red color after I learned how to put it on.</li>
      <li>have many other videos to browse through as well....</li>
      <li>It covers the grey just fine, but unless you spend a lot of time &amp;#34;shampooing&amp;#34; it into your head, meh.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will blend enough to tone down how bright it</li>
      <li>This is a great product, only negative thing is</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very very red, much more red than my hair.  </li>
      <li>so u can&#x27;t see it on your scalp and make sure u have it on the smallest amount to come out of the bottle or u r going to have a mess on your hands.</li>
      <li>This powder is very orange - I&#x27;m not sure how well it will blend with a more muted auburn hair color.</li>
      <li>ya might just find your new obsession!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is a little more fire red than copper right now and the red of this product is quite copper, but it somehow works.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was an auburn color available for my less flamboyant days.</li>
      <li>Like the application idea, but completely unnatural color.</li>
      <li>Reds fade fast into all different shades</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t be without this til some hair grows back, haha.</li>
      <li>This color has no versatility it is intense and would only work for 10% of redheads.</li>
      <li>A lighter color may be easier to apply and maybe red is too vibrant for this type of application process.</li>
      <li>I kept shaking, trying to get some onto the brush, harder and harder, and then finally this large amount comes out and sprays all around my sink basin!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find a satisfactory product for quick root touchups, especially if your hair color is a bit...different.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a satisfactory product for quick root touchups, especially if your hair color is a bit...different.  </li>
<li> This really red with an orange tint, not natural looking at all.</li>
<li> It comes straight out of the middle of the brush and leaves a thick residue on you head.</li>
<li> This is a loose powder with a hole in the middle of the brush which applies it.  </li>
<li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t cover up grey as well as liquid touch ups.</li>
<li> I wont buy this product again but I will try to use the rest of this red power in other ways, maybe mixed with a little conditioner or argan oil.</li>
<li> The color is made to come out of a little opening inside the brush and the red &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; literally falls everywhere as you are applying it to your head/hair.</li>
<li> I have a pixie I cut a little too short in places</li>
<li> I tried using a barbershop brush to fluff it around and blend it, and it did nothing.</li>
<li> It is VERY messy to apply and left my hair dry, brittle, and chalky.</li>
<li> A little truly goes a long way!</li>
<li> It sets well with a little hair spray.  </li>
<li> , only complaint is it is hard to get&lt;br /&gt;the cap over the brush when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
<li> Orange-Red like a CLOWN, also came out too heavily, staining the scalp.</li>
<li> Mess #2!  </li>
<li> I also tried to take some of the powder and put it on my hair, but only succeeded in glopping it way too thick and then smearing it on my face!!  </li>
<li> The color is too vivid, too artificial, does not look like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
<li> paid me a visit and the color is very hard to wash away once its on your hands and face not to mention porcelain sinks.</li>
<li> If you are using it for root touch up, you can&#x27;t really use the brush if you don&#x27;t want your scalp to look like you&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunburn.  </li>
<li> Mess #1!!  </li>
<li> It makes hair look dull and takes any shine out of it.</li>
<li> It was a waste of my money!!</li>
<li> Sadly this won&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
<li> the color is all wrong for me.  </li>
<li> AND it was the wrong color!  </li>
<li> The packaging and the way the product comes out of the container is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This powder is very orange - I&#x27;m not sure how well it will blend with a more muted auburn hair color. Maybe it will blend enough to tone down how bright it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the powder basically pours out of the brush/container and plops a giant puddle of powder on your hairline. I tried using a barbershop brush to fluff it around and blend it, and it did nothing. My scalp was bright orange. Next time I&#x27;ll try using an eyeshadow brush to apply the powder, and see it that works any better. The packaging and the way the product comes out of the container is terrible.</li>
    <li> Far too bright. Almost a neon color.  Like the application idea, but completely unnatural color.</li>
    <li> This is for &#x27;red&#x27;. Wow I love this stuff! I have a pixie I cut a little too short in places and although I don&#x27;t have the thinnest hair it&#x27;s so short on the sides you can see parts of my scalp. I got this product to cover that and it works like a charm. My hair is a little more fire red than copper right now and the red of this product is quite copper, but it somehow works. Reds fade fast into all different shades and I could see this working through all of them. Love! Won&#x27;t be without this til some hair grows back, haha.</li>
    <li> This color has no versatility it is intense and would only work for 10% of redheads. It was a waste of my money!!</li>
    <li> This stuff blends perfectly - very handy when I&#x27;m overdue to go for a color touch-up but just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
    <li> Orange-Red like a CLOWN, also came out too heavily, staining the scalp. I&#x27;ve used another brand from Sally&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t come out that way.</li>
    <li> This is a loose powder with a hole in the middle of the brush which applies it.  The color itself matches my hair very well, and helps to conceal well between salon visits.  It sets well with a little hair spray.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> This really red with an orange tint, not natural looking at all. The color is too vivid, too artificial, does not look like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair color. Also, turns your scalp the same color</li>
    <li> It covers the grey just fine, but unless you spend a lot of time &amp;#34;shampooing&amp;#34; it into your head, meh.</li>
    <li> Sadly this won&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s such a RED red the color is all wrong for me.  The brown was too brown.  It would be nice if they&#x27;d offer a combo - like an auburn color.</li>
    <li> The powder goes everywhere when applying it so I have to wash my forehead after. It makes hair look dull and takes any shine out of it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t cover up grey as well as liquid touch ups.</li>
    <li> It is very red which is nice if you have red hair as I&#x27;ve found most products labeld red are more brown than red.  If you are using it for root touch up, you can&#x27;t really use the brush if you don&#x27;t want your scalp to look like you&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunburn.  I&#x27;ve found if you coat a mascara type applicatorwith the red powder and apply it only to the hair shaft it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, only negative thing is u really have to work in the powder so u can&#x27;t see it on your scalp and make sure u have it on the smallest amount to come out of the bottle or u r going to have a mess on your hands.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped fast and packaged appropriately. The product itself however is another story. It is VERY messy to apply and left my hair dry, brittle, and chalky. It does not blend well but does cover your scalp but looks like you smeared chalk all over your head. Applying this &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; with a big built-in brush is not the way it should be applied. The color is made to come out of a little opening inside the brush and the red &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; literally falls everywhere as you are applying it to your head/hair. I ended up using my eyebrow brush to dip into the color very lightly and gently apply it to gray hair areas around my face where the color always washes/fades out first. That worked much better than the &amp;#34;dumping&amp;#34; process that the brush creates. My bathroom sink looked like Freddie Kreuger paid me a visit and the color is very hard to wash away once its on your hands and face not to mention porcelain sinks. I wont buy this product again but I will try to use the rest of this red power in other ways, maybe mixed with a little conditioner or argan oil. A lighter color may be easier to apply and maybe red is too vibrant for this type of application process.</li>
    <li> Color works, however, it gets all over your pillow when you go to bed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a satisfactory product for quick root touchups, especially if your hair color is a bit...different.  This Jonathan product is amazing.  It clings to hair and easily brushes off skin.  It&#x27;s easy to apply too much, but the learning curve is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the applicator and the product!  I just wish there was an auburn color available for my less flamboyant days.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t help cover gray hair well at all. It comes straight out of the middle of the brush and leaves a thick residue on you head.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this, and it was unsatisfactory from beginning to...end.  Anyone who says the application is easy...didn&#x27;t have my item!  Got it, it looked good, but I tried to get some powder onto the brush and it just...wouldn&#x27;t...come!  So, guess what happened?  I kept shaking, trying to get some onto the brush, harder and harder, and then finally this large amount comes out and sprays all around my sink basin!  Mess #1!!  Then I didn&#x27;t help matters:  I was trying to get the brush to retract, as it so neatly came out with a twist of the end, but actually succeeded in undoing the lid on the thing, so ...Mess #2!  Dumped a bunch more on my rug and floor!  (OK, I admit, the 2nd one was more than a little &amp;#34;stupid user error.&amp;#34;)  I also tried to take some of the powder and put it on my hair, but only succeeded in glopping it way too thick and then smearing it on my face!!  I am throwing this thing AWAY!!  So much for my experiment...</li>
    <li> Not bad at all.  It&#x27;s very very red, much more red than my hair.  You definately have to learn how to put it on.  Just very lightly touch hair, NOT your scalp.  After a while it actually did blend in to my own red color after I learned how to put it on. I will continue to use it when the roots start showing.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> Not for me. The color attached itself to my scalp, making me look sunburned. It did not stick to my hair. Maybe I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of using it correctly. I liked Masc-A-Gray Hair Mascara much better (and have a review there) and ended up buying two until I found my best color. Then I bought another tube of the same color, just in case they stop making it, which sometimes happens with things I love.</li>
    <li> not for the deep red but for copper or even ginger hair it would be great</li>
    <li> This really is a fantastic product.  Just use it to dab, though.  A little truly goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Color was more orange than amber. Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> great stuff, the red was perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;saved me from coloring my hair for a week&lt;br /&gt;ot two, only complaint is it is hard to get&lt;br /&gt;the cap over the brush when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;great brush tho.&lt;br /&gt;please keep it in stock amazon.</li>
    <li> If it was the right color and had a more managable brush- itd be great! Product binds to hair shaft and stays put all day.  GREAT coverage because the pigmentation is just over the top good.  I was very happy with this product even though I didnt care for the brush AND it was the wrong color!  So thats saying something!  I review MANY products of this type on my social media (I am a mua of 20+yrs and losing hair from lupus and fighting the signs of aging with ANYTHING that works....and isnt going to kill me...lol&lt;br /&gt;I will be posting a video review on this product for anyone interested that wants to actually SEE  the results with their own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have many other videos to browse through as well....ya might just find your new obsession!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie Hill/ Big Sky Beauty&lt;br /&gt;3553 Greyrock&lt;br /&gt;Helena, MT  59602&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4ddHxZIQTL1Y-n7fUqh4A</li>
    <li> I love this product. Easy to use and wash out, perfect for touchups.</li>
