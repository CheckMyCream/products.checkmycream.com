      <li>I am looking forward to purchasing more Deborah Lippmann colors.</li>
      <li>i love all of this nail lacquer...</li>
      <li>I love the glitter effect too.</li>
      <li>I love Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s nail line, this mermaid shade came up in a search I did for mermaid paraphernalia.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite out of all the Deborah Lippmann mermaid colors.</li>
      <li>This is an interesting polish for me.</li>
      <li>I have too many nail polishes already though.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite polishes.</li>
      <li>should also mention that because of the texture you can be more flexible with your application</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This was in the Sephora Summer Stash (which is where I got it), but it seems more spring-like to me.</li>
      <li>she was absolutely in love with the color</li>
      <li>Depending upon what I do, I can have \\&quot;perfect nails\\&quot; for a week to ten days with this</li>
      <li>It does have a bit of a texture to it even after adding top coat, so if you like your nails perfectly smooth, this might not be for you (however, it is smoother than the sand-type finish that&#x27;s so popular now).</li>
      <li>The polish went on very easy and was so easy to touch up.</li>
      <li>This great formula is very longlasting and shing color but easy to take it off with nail-cleaner liquid.</li>
      <li>If I use a top coat it mutes it, and I really enjoy the mother-of-pearl type sheen as well as the rough/bumpy texture.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, and just looks stunning on your fingers.  </li>
      <li>Patching up tip wear was easy due to the texture and one coat of topcoat smoothed it out perfectly.</li>
      <li>Easily the most unique color in my 60+ bottle collection</li>
      <li>It so smooth and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>One coat was a little sparse, but two coats was perfect coverage.</li>
      <li>The application was smooth, with an even distribution of the glittery bits.</li>
      <li>I gave this fabulous color as a gift this Christmas.</li>
      <li>So pretty you won&#x27;t regret this one!!</li>
      <li>my new favorite nail polish!</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>Omg I was so excited</li>
      <li>The color combination is incredibly unique, and looks like you are wearing the beach on your toes.</li>
      <li>So unique, I don&#x27;t have anything else like it.</li>
      <li>Wow this color is just amazing.</li>
      <li>loved the glittery shine it left on my nails.</li>
      <li>I read so many reviews before spending so much money on this brand, and I kept reading how chunky it is</li>
      <li>so I grabbed it up for a good price,got a coupon towards my next purchase</li>
      <li>The polish holds up pretty well and touch ups are easy to patch</li>
      <li>The real simple plug said: the next best thing to dipping your toes in the ocean.  </li>
      <li>beautiful color, dried quicker than other polishes I have used, not so great coverage, clumpy and duller than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color though.</li>
      <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I imagine a mermaid&#x27;s tail would look like!</li>
      <li>It is a fun color and my daughter-in-law&#x27;s new favorite color</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t think it was any longer-lasting than my other polishes, the texture/glitter made touching up chips very easy because the fix blended right in.</li>
      <li>Deborah Lippmann knows how to do glitter, and this polish proves it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky to remove, but it&#x27;s outrageously worth</li>
      <li>Lippmann collection is pricey but well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>This color is very bold, yet classy.</li>
      <li>It would look good with a variety of base colors, actually, but probably wouldn&#x27;t be great on its own unless you&#x27;re prepared to use a LOT of coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was my first bottle of Deborah Lippmann and</li>
      <li>Thisnnail polish is stunningly pretty.  </li>
      <li>It takes some extra scrubbing with a cotton ball to get the polish off, but most glitter polishes do.</li>
      <li>I love Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s polishes and this was the first one I bought, actually.</li>
      <li>It goes on like a dream (I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;mermaid&#x27;s dream\\&quot; ;)\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Thanks for that info!</li>
      <li>It was really pretty</li>
      <li>Overall not as satisfied as I thought I would be for the price i paid.</li>
      <li>I love anything mermaid related.  </li>

    <li> Wow this color is just amazing. I put two coats to my nails and it look so beautiful. I&#x27;m so stoked. Love the color, everything. Definitely worth the price.(: Hope this helped</li>
    <li> This color is very bold, yet classy. It goes on smoothly, and just looks stunning on your fingers.  The glitter in it just makes it all come together for an all around amazing color.</li>
    <li> My wife recently received this new shade and tried it.  She loves it.  After using Hard Rock base coat, she applied 2 coats of Mermaids Dream and then applied a coat of Boom,Boom, Pow followed by Addicted to Speed for top coat.  This is a good color for all ages.  If you want some glitter but not to much, leave off the Boom,Boom, Pow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Lippmann collection is pricey but well worth it.  Why spend the time putting on polish to have it start chipping in a day or two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best polish collection she has ever used.</li>
    <li> Probably the best nail polish in the world. Color, consistency, quality. It is a dream in a bottle. I love Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s polishes and this was the first one I bought, actually. Be warned, you will be addicted and can never buy cheap polish again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish! The color combination is incredibly unique, and looks like you are wearing the beach on your toes. The polish went on very easy and was so easy to touch up. This polish is perfect for someone who likes to do their nails at home, but is not a pro at applying polish. It takes some extra scrubbing with a cotton ball to get the polish off, but most glitter polishes do. I am looking forward to purchasing more Deborah Lippmann colors.</li>
    <li> Deborah Lippmann knows how to do glitter, and this polish proves it. It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous and so unique. I get so many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite polishes. So unique, I don&#x27;t have anything else like it. It is very pigmented and opaque. Really beautiful and unique. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Deborah Lippmann nail polishes, but her mermaid ones are ah-mazing! This nail polish is highly pigmented and it does not chip or peel off at all/easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit tricky to remove, but it&#x27;s outrageously worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Shockingly beautiful. It seems insane to spend this much on a single bottle of nail polish but it truly is unique.</li>
    <li> Omg I was so excited when I got this I immediately swatched it and it was almost opaque with one coat. Then I did Essie navigate her and used mermaid&#x27;s dream as a fade toward the tips. It was really pretty and I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at it also I received many compliments from colleagues at work one person even thought it was one of those nail laquer stickers. Patching up tip wear was easy due to the texture and one coat of topcoat smoothed it out perfectly. Love it. Would also be great as an accent nail or wear alone on all nails. So pretty you won&#x27;t regret this one!!</li>
    <li> Pretty and great quality but I&#x27;m never spending $20 on nail polish again lol. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.</li>
    <li> I love anything mermaid related.  This is a beautiful,shimmery aqua with sparkles. The polish goes on well and wears well.  Perfect for a summer beach.</li>
    <li> my new favorite nail polish! Its beyond great&lt;br /&gt;Its kinda expensive, but kinda worth it for the color.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought another from this brand, and would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I love Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s nail line, this mermaid shade came up in a search I did for mermaid paraphernalia. I wore an undercoat of the Essie polish someone mentioned in the comment section, and it worked like a dream. Thanks for that info!</li>
    <li> the color matched my gown I wore to my sisters wedding to a tee. loved the glittery shine it left on my nails.</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;I love this shade! Like all Deborah Lippmann nail polishes, it is a dream to apply and it looks like you&#x27;ve had a professional manicure. It reminds me of her shade \\&quot;Diamonds &amp; Pearls\\&quot; in that it doesn&#x27;t dry totally flat, but slightly grainy/bumpy, which I like--both shades tend to last a long time for me, even without a top coat. I always wear a base coat with Deborah Lippmann shades that include glitter, because otherwise they can be too difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this shade I use two quick base coats (because I really don&#x27;t like to work to get my polish off) and only one coat of the Mermaid&#x27;s Dream--no top coat. If I use a top coat it mutes it, and I really enjoy the mother-of-pearl type sheen as well as the rough/bumpy texture. To freshen it up, after several days I then add a second coat, just because I always like my nails to look well-groomed and I&#x27;m tough on them, washing dishes in hot water, washing my hair in a hot bath with my nails, etc. So after 3-5 days I want that touch-up. Depending upon what I do, I can have \\&quot;perfect nails\\&quot; for a week to ten days with this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that because of the texture you can be more flexible with your application: I went ahead and accidentally rubbed some off before it was dry and just patched the hole. With a normal nail polish you&#x27;d be able to tell and it would look sloppy. But with Mermaid&#x27;s Dream, it blended in and you couldn&#x27;t tell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> Beautiful polish. Arrived on time. Love!!</li>
    <li> J&#x27;ai reçu le colis une semaine après l&#x27;avoir commandé, le vernis était bien emballé, je n&#x27;ai pas eu de problème.&lt;br /&gt;Cette couleur est magnifique, parfaite pour l&#x27;été ! La texture est granuleuse mais un coup de top coat à la fin et c&#x27;est tout lisse !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package one week after the order. The bottle was very well wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;This color is wonderful, perfect for summer !</li>
    <li> beautiful color, dried quicker than other polishes I have used, not so great coverage, clumpy and duller than I thought it would be. Overall not as satisfied as I thought I would be for the price i paid. I would recommend for use on toes instead of fingers!</li>
    <li> I gave this fabulous color as a gift this Christmas. It is a fun color and my daughter-in-law&#x27;s new favorite color</li>
    <li> The complete process from ordering to (overseas) delivery went well. There wasn&#x27;t any Problem at all. I got the nail lacquer of my dreams. Wonderful colour and top quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot. I will order again.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is GORGEOUS!!!!! It reminds me of a mermaid&#x27;s tail, definitely! It goes on like a dream (I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;mermaid&#x27;s dream\\&quot; ;)\\&quot; It so smooth and easy to work with. Two coats is opaque and it&#x27;s just beautiful and so unique!</li>
    <li> i love all of this nail lacquer... the color is so bright, the texture is perfect, all of my friend like it a lot, and its very easy to take it off. I fully reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Deborah Lippman Mermaids Dream Nail Polish is great for every girls and wowmen who love decorate their nail. This great formula is very longlasting and shing color but easy to take it off with nail-cleaner liquid.</li>
    <li> I was just as delighted with this polish as I hoped I would be. The formula applies very easily, and removal was easier than a lot of glittery polishes. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> The real simple plug said: the next best thing to dipping your toes in the ocean.  I agree.  Would look better if I didn&#x27;t have such ugly feet, but that&#x27;s not something I can help...</li>
    <li> This is awesome summer color and holds up for days without chipping.</li>
    <li> When I saw this color online, I just had to have it, and on my fingers it did not disappoint. Easily the most unique color in my 60+ bottle collection, it&#x27;s seafoam green, blue, and gold all at one time and seems to radiate and glow right off my fingers. I couldn&#x27;t stop admiring it! The application was smooth, with an even distribution of the glittery bits. One coat was a little sparse, but two coats was perfect coverage. It does have a bit of a texture to it even after adding top coat, so if you like your nails perfectly smooth, this might not be for you (however, it is smoother than the sand-type finish that&#x27;s so popular now). While I don&#x27;t think it was any longer-lasting than my other polishes, the texture/glitter made touching up chips very easy because the fix blended right in. The only true negative about this polish is the removal process, but it wasn&#x27;t any worse than other glitters, and was better than the super-chunky variety. This was my first bottle of Deborah Lippmann and the price did give me a little hesitation at first, but for this particular color I can definitely say the splurge was worth it. The color is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews before spending so much money on this brand, and I kept reading how chunky it is but I didn&#x27;t think it was, it is the same as other glittery polishes I have bought for alot less and loved, goes on smoothly with sparkles.  I love the color, Mermaid&#x27;s Dream, but as for chunks, I was expecting something really different, especially for the money.  If I buy it again it would be for the color, but for the price, I don&#x27;t see what the fuss is all about this brand.  Every brand today seems to have a good assortment of wonderful glittery colors, for alot less.  I gave it four stars for the color.</li>
    <li> I have never tried this nail polish brand because of the price. But I am happy to say it is great. It dries fast and the pigment is awesome. The color is very pretty. I love the glitter effect too. It would look great on all skin tones I am sure. I will buy from this brand again.</li>
    <li> Two coats of Mermaid&#x27;s dream and a top coat of Essie lux effects in As Gold as it Gets and I was happy. Chipped easier than I had hoped. Boo.</li>
    <li> Thisnnail polish is stunningly pretty.  The teal/blue/green shades glimmer gorgeously.  It has good coverage, stays on fine, and with a top coat shines more.</li>
    <li> Lippmann polishes have a great formula so application is flawless. I had minor tip wear after three or four days.</li>
    <li> pictures do not do this color justice its gorgeous! gave it as a gift to my friend she was absolutely in love with the color had it on her wishlist so I grabbed it up for a good price,got a coupon towards my next purchase so I cab pick myself up a bottle of Deborah Lippmann for myself</li>
    <li> This is an interesting polish for me. It seemed a little thin/light, so I first put on a couple of layers of opaque white polish. Then I put on two layers of this, and finished with a clear topcoat (from Seche Vite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingernails look a little bit like speckled Easter candy now. This was in the Sephora Summer Stash (which is where I got it), but it seems more spring-like to me. Oh well, not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this seems quite long-wearing. I&#x27;ll probably get tired of my manicure colors before it chips (I switch things up at least twice a week when it comes to nail color). It was fairly easy to apply, not the smoothest application ever, but good, and I put at least part of the blame for the lack of smoothness on the white polish I used as a base (not from the same brand). The white base really makes this color pop, although next time, I think I&#x27;ll try it over a sea green color. It would look good with a variety of base colors, actually, but probably wouldn&#x27;t be great on its own unless you&#x27;re prepared to use a LOT of coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dried quickly and I think it still has a nice shine, even with the topcoat. It has a little bit of a bumpy texture but if you don&#x27;t like that, just use extra topcoat (that&#x27;s what I did).</li>
    <li> Wayyyy too hard to get off once you put on two coats or even just one! Its a bit rough texture because of the glitter. Very pretty color though. Unfortunately I lost mine when I moved back home after school. Kinda expensive but all makeup and beauty products are. I would get it again. In time. I have too many nail polishes already though.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite out of all the Deborah Lippmann mermaid colors. It&#x27;s got a lot of depth to it - sort of shimmery green polish with barely there gold undertones and larger pieces of green glitter mixed in. It&#x27;s exactly what I imagine a mermaid&#x27;s tail would look like! I do two coats ( three, if I&#x27;m feeling ambitious) with a base coat. It does dry with a bit of texture, but not enough to need a top coat. The polish holds up pretty well and touch ups are easy to patch-fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get TONS of compliments on it every time I wear it! I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with a Deborah Lippmann polish yet!</li>
