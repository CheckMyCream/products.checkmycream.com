    <li> Got exactly what was shown and in a very timely manner. I would defiantly shop with you again. Thanx</li>
    <li> I like this it&#x27;s simple to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my daughters when I use this product in their hair. I would order more than one for a house full of girls! I just wish the directions came in English as well but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I used it maybe twice on my daughters hair and it snapped. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Reliable! Product was just how it was described.</li>
    <li> i was surprised to still find this tool.  i love this tool.  it works so great and very quick things to do with your hair.</li>
    <li> They work but are very flimsy &amp; I have to help the hair come through.  My grandson chewed through one &amp; he only has 4 little teeth</li>
    <li> Do not buy. It broke the first time I use it. You got what you paid for. Cheap terrible product.</li>
    <li> I USED IT ONE TIME AND IT BROKE</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve already used it several times on both my daughters for school.</li>
    <li> This product is not strong enough for thick hair. The plastic is to flimsy. Ireally have to fight to get it to work.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Been looking for one for two years. I love it.  It make the ponytail wrap so simple. Try one.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and it broke the very first time I tried using it. Piece got caught in my hair! Even though it was not expensive, still not worth the $2.</li>
    <li> awesome for easy hair dos</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been having a great time with this tool. This is very user friendly and very affordably priced.</li>
    <li> The loop is too small for my hair...  it is very uncomfortable to turn it around. Maybe this is for kids only..</li>
    <li> I had one of these ever since I was a kid.  I lost it and bought another one.  I love these topsy tails because even if you have no time to do anything with your hair and want more than just a pony tail you can topsy tail it and it looks like you spent much more time on your hair than you have.  you can add barretes, combs, or just plain.  great look.</li>
    <li> This topsy tale was very faulty... my daughters hair is thin and not thick at all yet it broke after a few times of using it... When I received it I noticed a small imperfection in the loop and this is exactly where it broke at...</li>
    <li> Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> I had one when they first can out years ago. So I just had to get another one.</li>
