      <li>So I guess in the long run I won&#x27;t use as many blades so in that aspect it will be cheaper in the long run.</li>
      <li>The blades I received were the exact same quality as the ones found anywhere else.</li>
      <li>So very incredibly disappointed by this purchase/subscription as everything has always been great at Amazon!  </li>

    <li> Close smooth shave. Will last for most of a month with daily shaving. Packaged well. Sharp.</li>

    <li> Great blades. I normally buy these in a store but love the added convenience of having them delivered to your door. Even better if you sign up for the automatic shipping so you don&#x27;t even have to worry about even ordering them. The blades I received were the exact same quality as the ones found anywhere else. I did get to try them free thanks to Gillette!</li>
    <li> Best razors there are out there. Also, I received these as part of a promotion from Gillette.</li>
    <li> So very incredibly disappointed by this purchase/subscription as everything has always been great at Amazon!  Will most definitely be canceling &amp; would very much prefer to return the unused blades &amp; receive a refund.

    <li> I have had better shaves!</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors for many years now and I stay loyal to the brand. They get the closest shave and do not irritate my skin. The fact that I can now subscribe to get my replacement cartridges and shaving gel when I need them is a great option. I really recommend this brand of cartridges if you want a nice close shave. They also have a strip on the top which changes colors to let you know when its time to change them. I received this product free thanks to Gillette and bzzagent, this does not affect my opinions I have been using this razors for years.</li>
    <li> The blades arrived on time as promised</li>
    <li> Good quality for a good price</li>
    <li> This is the best deal!!!!  The price on this item as well as the packaging was awesome.</li>
    <li> Even without a subscription, this is a helluva deal! I&#x27;ll be taking advantage of this for a while!!</li>
    <li> I prefer this blade over any others however I don&#x27;t see how you can say it&#x27;s cheaper than the razor club, the razor club was cheaper however it is a  cheap handle &amp; the blades are not as sharp or last as long as these do. So I guess in the long run I won&#x27;t use as many blades so in that aspect it will be cheaper in the long run. I shall see this is month #1.</li>
    <li> Very good deal- Thanks</li>
    <li> These Manual blades fit and work the exact same on power razor. I&#x27;ve never bought the power one&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a rip off they&#x27;re no different!</li>
    <li> Love the feel but need to change my credit card on file can someone call me?</li>
    <li> Excellent Gillette razors at a good price.  And I dont need to go to store to buy razors with this plan.  I like these razors much better than the other shave club.  I tried that for convenience sake but the product does not measure up to the Gillette Fusion product.</li>
    <li> Certainly easier to purchase the blades this way. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the pocket so bad!</li>
    <li> best razor ever, blades are pricey but they last a long time.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Just your average razor from Gillette. So it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Better then purchasing them at the store, less expensive.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It did the job, but I did not cut it clean</li>
    <li> This is a nice option, and I love the prompt delivery</li>
    <li> delivered very quick. I think I got them the next day. I shave twice a week, and got to try this blade after using dollar shave club for a while now [I had the Gillette Fusion Power before]. And man have I been missing out. You can tell the quality of the blade almost almost immediately. Ya its a bit pricier but for the frequency of shaving that I do, I&#x27;d rather go with these blades.</li>
    <li> Best pricing on the market for these particular blades, even when comparing it to the club stores.  The packaging is exceptional.  Easy out, no scissors needed.  Of course, I wish that blades in general were less expensive, but I have tried the off-price alternatives and haven&#x27;t been satisfied.</li>
