<li> Other less expensive immitations break down much quicker and are less effective in exfoliating.</li>
<li> I actually used on my face to lift up dead skin cells bc of my problem</li>
<li> All dead skin and rough patches gone, use the smaller one for my face and it just makes it glow</li>
<li> One side is rougher than the other being that it&#x27;s an exfoliater.</li>
<li> I have tried other brands, but, they don&#x27;t stand up.</li>
<li> I have purchased similar and less expensive Buf-Puf Body/Facial Sponges at the big &amp;#34;box stores&amp;#34; and the quality is not the same.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone seriously considering facial products.</li>
<li> I used this product a few years ago and thought I would try it again.  </li>
<li> also wished it would cost less!</li>
<li> No more darkness on knees or elbows.</li>
<li> No more &amp;#34;washcloths&amp;#34; to get musty or to have to wash.  </li>
<li> Buf Pufs are hard to find in the store these days.  </li>
<li> I suppose if you have very delicate skin, the Buf-Puf might not be for you.</li>

    <li> i just started using the sponge so far i really like it, i can&#x27;t say how durable it is or how long i will be able to use it, but at this point it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great sponge. Quite a difference from my old one.</li>
    <li> This is larger than the one designed for the face. One side is for the body and one side for the face. I like it better than the other body scrubber products. Sure the other products are pretty and come in colors, but they are to soft for me.. I suppose if you have very delicate skin, the Buf-Puf might not be for you.</li>
    <li> This body sponge does the job. One side is rougher than the other being that it&#x27;s an exfoliater. I actually used on my face to lift up dead skin cells bc of my problem acne skin. Makes ur face and body feel smooth after use.</li>
    <li> Buf Pufs are hard to find in the store these days.  These are great to use with a bath gel product to take off dull try skin while revealing smooth skin underneath.</li>
    <li> Love it , my favorite buf-puf. Woman you will love to transform your skin , this is it. No more darkness on knees or elbows. And makes skin soft as a baby :)</li>
    <li> These are great! They exfoliate so well. They clean up easy. I have tried other brands, but, they don&#x27;t stand up. Love them!</li>
    <li> This is the size of your palm.</li>
    <li> Great service and product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.....AND I LUUUUUV IT!&lt;br /&gt;ALONG WITH A GOOD DIET, (NO GREASE, NO SUGAR, NO PORK, VEGGIES AND&lt;br /&gt;FRUTS, NO STRESS, AND LOTS OF REST) THIS WORKS WONDERS.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I do wish I could find in stores, but the ease of ordering online is just as easy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and years. I use the Buf Puf every time I shower.They exfoliate very well and my skin feels great.  They are becoming increasingly more difficult  to find which is very upsetting.  Thankfully this seller helped me out by selling them!</li>
    <li> I remember Buf Puf from awhile ago. My mom used the all the time. When I saw them I had to get it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Nothing smooths my upper arms and legs like these do!</li>
    <li> I used this product a few years ago and thought I would try it again.  It works just as well.  It is very effective in removing dead skiing.  It seems a bit flimsier than before so I don&#x27;t think it will last through more than 10 uses.</li>
    <li> I like the white, less-abrasive side for skin folds where perspiration (and fungi) want to collect and the blue, more-abrasive side for keeping the stubble on my legs under control without actually shaving.  I had almost forgotten about this brand; glad to see it&#x27;s still around.</li>
    <li> Does the job of exfoliating bit thought I was ordering a puff sponge. I like it, husband does not. I buy what he likes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Buf-Puf body sponge since the 1980&#x27;s. The oval shape is ideal for lightly exfoliating around the eyelids/nose area. The white end gently exfoliates tender skin ... but for deeper exfoliation, the aqua blue side does the job without any abrasive feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge is a great BODY SPONGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review was helpful ...

    <li> I just wish they lasted longer. No more &amp;#34;washcloths&amp;#34; to get musty or to have to wash.  Holds plenty of soap so I can scrub my face (and the rest of my body.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many years and continue to purchase more.  Especially helpful for the acne prone and to smooth uneven skin..</li>
    <li> love this product!  only wish it did not lose its puffiness so quickly.  also wished it would cost less!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Buf-Puf for decades and I swear by it.  But after years of using the same texture, I felt I needed something stronger.  This did the trick! I love it.  My skin is so much better than it was before. I am so happy I decided to try this. Thanks to the other reviewers who helped me in the decision. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it without all of you!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love? All dead skin and rough patches gone, use the smaller one for my face and it just makes it glow</li>
    <li> Amazing results after just a few uses. Makes the skin feel alive and fresh, I use it as often as I can and like the results you get.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take off my winter lizard flakiness.  It works well with moisturizing after shower.  Delivery on time.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great sponges. i have used them for years. Mostly on my face to clears the fine lines and dead skin. I would recommend this to anyone seriously considering facial products.</li>
    <li> I have purchased similar and less expensive Buf-Puf Body/Facial Sponges at the big &amp;#34;box stores&amp;#34; and the quality is not the same. Other less expensive immitations break down much quicker and are less effective in exfoliating. I rely on the quality and durability of the Buf-Puf Sponge.</li>
    <li> Love these..always have!!!!</li>
