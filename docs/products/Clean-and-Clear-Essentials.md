<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product. competative price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for about a year now. It works very well and it leaves my face felling clean. IT is great for those with oily skin.</li>
    <li> This has been the best thing for my t-zone.</li>
    <li> In high school, I had acne, but it was an occasional pimple here and there, no big deal. I about two years ago, and have since moved to Florida (very different from my homeland of Connecticut). I don&#x27;t know if it was the climate change, or what...but my face exploded. I went from having an almost flawless face to having some acne scarring around my mouth, in just a year or so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where it was the worst. Around my mouth. I had to spend at least fifteen minutes every day applying concealer and foundation just to cover it all up, and I refused to step out into public without any makeup on. It was painful, and downright embarrassing. My self esteem was ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a ton of products: masks, face washes, spot treatments, wipes etc. But they all failed miserably. Nothing even managed to make a dent in my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night I went to walmart in search of a product, and stumbled upon this face wash. Now, it&#x27;s a three step process (wash, toner, and moisturizer). I bought all three, only cost me about $15.00 total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work immediately, but after a week or so I noticed that my face had cleared up substantially. It isn&#x27;t perfect. But it only takes a few minutes to put makeup on now, my face isn&#x27;t constantly in pain, and I do wander out into public bare faced sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, no product is perfect. But this one actually works. And that&#x27;s all I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you have to use it religiously. I go through the process of washing my face, toning, and moisturizing every morning when I wake up, and every night when I&#x27;m showering/ getting ready for bed (it really only takes a few minutes). If you miss a step, or slack off on doing it, all of that hard work will disappear. I ran out of the face wash and toner at about the same time, and went a few days without buying new ones, and my face lashed out in serious revenge. SO I guess it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the problems leading to myacne, it just puts them into hibernation lol! But I don&#x27;t mind. I follow the steps, and my face looks better than it did a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend you give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser a lot. I also bought the toner and moisturizer that goes with it. It all works very well on my face. I have oily, sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. It makes my face feel clean and helps with acne. The cleanser is #1 in the regime, the toner is #2, and the moisturizer is #3 in the regime. I am really happy with how my face feels and looks after using them.</li>
    <li> Having acne, I&#x27;ve been going through different products to find one that works. Someone recommended this one to me and I gave it a try. However, it hasn&#x27;t treated my acne at all. When you look at the actual active ingredients there is only one called triclosan, or something such as that. It is listed on the bottle as a cleaner/ soap. This product is good for washing your face with, but if you have acne, I do not suggest you buy it as acne is an internal problem, not an external problem. This may be good for cleaning your face, but it will not treat your acne.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.  Foams up and rinses off nicely even with my horrid well water</li>
    <li> face feels super clean and oil free after use</li>
    <li> So far so good. I really like the feel of this soap and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out too much, which has always been a problem for me. Seems to take only about half as much as most face wash to do the same job. Cheap and better than much more expensive soaps I&#x27;ve used that leave my face irritated.</li>
    <li> smells strange and leaves a film on my skin.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far I can guarantee you that it will remove the excess of your make up with just one wash. It also leaves the face dry but not excessively dry, which is a good thing. I totally recommend for removing make up from the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I see any improvements on anything else, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel clean.</li>
    <li> I have used it exclusively for many years as it removes my particularly oily face skin and I do not like the feeling of an oily face.</li>
    <li> OK so here&#x27;s the wrap guys. Its a great product if you are looking for a simple non abrasive cleanser. This is a clear simple cleanser that I use for normal day use. It doesn&#x27;t exactly moisten your skin but that&#x27;s the whole point right? I know some other reviews will say that it didn&#x27;t work for them but come on clear skin isn&#x27;t based off one product. I would recommend this along with a light exfoliator. So if you are breaking out go head and try this out with your routine. Its more of a basic staple item that you should own</li>
    <li> I love clean and clear face wash but this stuff SUCKS!!!! First it does not really foam up and second it leaves a weird film on your face so your face does not really feel clean. It made me break out worse than I already am!! :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a multitude of cleansers throughout my teenage years (Purpose, Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash/Scrub, etc.), but I&#x27;m happy I finally found a cleanser that works for my oily, acne-prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry and it has a pleasant, gentle scent . . . and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I started using it once a day in the morning (I use a cold cream at night) and within a week or two my face cleared up beautifully. I would definitely recommend this cleanser for anyone with oily skin on a budget.</li>
    <li> I works ok but I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash, have used it for 4 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent hygienic item that doesn&#x27;t over-dry one&#x27;s skin.  I tend to have combination skin--oily around the cheeks, chin, and nose; dry around the eyes and temples.  This product seems to satisfy both extremes equally.</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week on my face and other areas where I get acne.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it everyday because my skin gets dry.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for me. It&#x27;s affordable so you aren&#x27;t spending an arm and leg trying to treat acne. It comes out as a gel like substance. I pump a small amount, less than the size of a penny (no more than that is needed, in my opinion, more is just wasteful). I put my fingers slightly under the water and rub my hands together creating a foamy substance. Rub it on your face, make sure to get your T-ZONE area. Star with once a day applying then work your way up to twice a day. I do with my morning routine then right before bed. After about a day or two of using it twice a day, I notice a difference in my face. I don&#x27;t know about combining this with the use of other acne products. I believe there is a Clean &amp; Clear acne system that this goes with, so try that together or this by itself. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower for my neck and face. I have mostly oily skin and this is perfect for shine control.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (I was afraid it would but it&#x27;s not an issue at all with this product).  My face feels nice and clean after washing with this facial wash.  Very happy with this purchase and will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Technically I have combination skin but my T-zone gets REALLY oily. This cleanser makes my skin feel very clean, fresh and balanced. It gets rid of all the oil, makeup and dirt without making my face feel tight and dried out.</li>
    <li> I like using thins product at night right before i go to sleep. This doesn&#x27;t make the pimples go away magically from your face it just helps clean your face from all the dirt and clogged pores.</li>
    <li> Cleans my face well enough and I have had reduced acne, however, I only use this product every other day. I use witch hazel and essential oils in combination with the Clean and Clear moisturizer .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only a few facial break outs now that clear up relatively fast, where as without the combination of these products my skin was very oily and prone to break outs. I did notice that the astringent in this line of C&amp;C products was entirely too harsh for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these products however have reduced my pore size, or my black heads slowly forming on my nose.</li>
    <li> The dispenser didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> good product.  very good price</li>
    <li> I really do not feel the need for any fancy face washes. I have combination oily skin and this Clean &amp; Clear has served me well over the years with no complaints. It dries out my skin a little but in a good way. I really gets rid of any oil I may have and leaves my face fresh and clean. No irritation and not to mention that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product to get the job done. And its affordable too? Sign me up!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday afterwork.  working in construction i can get pretty filthy.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t overdry my face.</li>
    <li> I always use the clean and clear line: really excellent.</li>
    <li> I was about to later up with body soap this morning and realized I hadn&#x27;t yet rubbed this stuff all over my face. So then I did... and my face was clean. Then I did the &#x27;Walk like an Egyptian&#x27; dance. Showers are the best.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like it much this soap</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive skin, and I never had any issues with any facial cleansers. However, this cleanser made my face tingle, feeling burnt and extremely irritated (especially around my lips). I&#x27;ve been a loyal consumer of Clean &amp; Clear facial cleanser products for years, but my skin reaction to this product made me reconsider.</li>
    <li> Great, effective and cheap!</li>
    <li> This is a good soap for the face, does not dry the skin, giving it 3 stars because I prefer the Clean &amp; Clear Morning with Bursting Beads, this one is awesome.</li>
    <li> Perfect way to clean the day off your face without drying out.</li>
    <li> This order came on time and was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts for months! You only need a tiny amount to foam.</li>
    <li> Very nice facial wash. It smells amazing and it works perfectly. Very happy about it</li>
    <li> On the front of the product, it says something about not over-drying.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it DOES OVER-DRY.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I love the other products of Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
    <li> works well and makes my face feel squeaky clean</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin red and feels burnt.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so it says a lot about the product.  Also, I purchased this product at Walmart and it was only 3 dollars and some cents, so don&#x27;t pay this amount of money for it...it will be a waste.</li>
    <li> It just makes my face feel really dry, not refreshed.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than you can get it anywhere else and free shipping with Prime.  A simple non oily face wash that leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean... literally!  Easy pump dispenser that closes with a quarter turn of the dial and is secure enough to thrown in any bag  for easy travel.  Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> it dried my skin out :(</li>
    <li> Love this. I use it everyday to keep my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> they came damaged, wasnt pleased with the packaging and some of the product leaked out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a base for my roseacea treatment regimen for a couple of years.  This is an excellent facial cleanser with no oil.  Excess oil is an added issue for me.</li>
    <li> Removes make up well but leaves my combination skin feeling extremely dry.  I love clean and clear face washes but will not be using this one again.</li>
    <li> I love clean &amp; clear face wash , it does&#x27;nt dry your face or make your face oily the only problem is it goes to fast</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser at night. It makes your face feel nice and clean without overdrying it. It&#x27;s also great for removing makeup. I have sensitive, pretty oily skin and it works well for me. My boyfriend, who often complains of face wash drying out his skin, also uses this and loves it.</li>
    <li> Really cleans face well but smells terrible! I hate the smell so bad I don&#x27;t use it often but it would be an awesome product if smelled good</li>
    <li> The only soap my wife will use</li>
    <li> Great face-wash for oily skin. My skin is acne free now and feels fresh the whole day. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered more since it is all what it claimed to be.  It does a good job.</li>
    <li> The old formula was so much better. I had been using this face wash for atleast a year and when they changed the formula, not only does it have an unpleasant smell but it dries my face out and and made me breakout. Will not be using this anymore unless they bring back the old formula, which I hope they do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed to never have big acne problems. A small pimple here and there that would clear up within two days. But I still wanted a good everyday face wash. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two years. No problem. No pimples. I use this everyday. But for my past few washes I&#x27;ve felt a small burning sensation that I&#x27;ve never felt before. It has been good to me up until now. I&#x27;m going to switch over to ambi just to start working on a more even skin tone but other than that, this product works for me. Very cheap at Walmart</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and I love it. It foams without drying. My face feels really clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to cleanser.  It does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do not like how the liquid coagulates where it pumps out the soap.  It forms a hardened liquid deposit that must be scraped off to work well.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of this product since my high school days -- over a decade.  This cleanser is a no frills product that thoroughly cleanses your skin of oil and makeup, without causing breakouts.  The bottle lasts for months, even when used 2-3 times per day.</li>
    <li> More suitable for people who are oily. I have oily to combination skin; I am a little oily on my T-zone and but have normal cheeks. This can be a little too drying for my skin at times. I use this on nights when I am extremely oily. This really gets everything out of your face. A little goes a long way with this product. I only use a pea size amount for my whole face. It foams and lathers well.</li>
    <li> Only good for washing your face. Clean and clear doesn&#x27;t have a great acne clearing solution.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Removes my makeup and clean my face.  I have less breakout.</li>
    <li> love this for my oily skin and does not dry it out</li>
    <li> I usually only use this wash once a day in the morning, but the water is so hard where I live now that I have had to step it up and use it morning and night.  I also have rosacea, but this soap doesn&#x27;t aggravate or irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The spout does not work!!! And I couldn&#x27;t recieve a refund or a new product!</li>
