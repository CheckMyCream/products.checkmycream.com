      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t show any signs of eczema. :)</li>
      <li>-- I left it in my car during a prolonged freeze and it stood up perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I thought it will be better than this.</li>
      <li>Also this particular size is great for travel.</li>
      <li>I have used many  moisturisers for  my dry hands ,but this is the best one.</li>
      <li>This lotion scores a two which is pretty good.</li>

      <li>Aveeno makes the best skin care products on the market and this particular size is very convenient for travel.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer, it is not greasy or oily and goes on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
      <li>The product rubs in easily and is not greasy on the hands.</li>
      <li>very* light oats/almonds scent that vanishes quickly.  </li>
      <li>however, I do use it on my face and it seems to be working just fine.</li>
      <li>So if you aren&#x27;t allergic to oatmeal sent then you are fine.  </li>
      <li>I love Aveeno products for my very sensitive skins and this is a nice size to keep in the purse, drawer at work or anyplace I need.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
      <li>And the lotion really keeps your skin nice.</li>
      <li>This is a great basic moisturizer for the money!  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast thank you !!!</li>
      <li>Definetly worth it!</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s a good business move for Aveeno, but it would be nice if they would be a little bit more consumer aware.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy now that I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed by my face being dry and covered in flakes.</li>
      <li>Look carefully at the pricing where there is great variance on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes and absorbs quickly with no lingering scent.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that once the bottle is done, there is no way to unscrew the top and add more lotion.</li>
      <li>I work constantly with paper at my job and also tend to wash my hands more often than most.</li>
      <li>It goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy-feeling residue.</li>

      <li>I buy the little Aveeno for everywhere and this is a great size for the car and purse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not unhappy with it</li>
      <li>Good product, lighter weight lotion than I expected.</li>
      <li>I keep this size in my glove compartment and it is the right size for air travel.</li>
      <li>I wish I had been able to get  a larger size in this product.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it locally so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>So I tried during a hot summer, and no change --</li>
      <li>My first encounter with Aveeno was when the dermatologist recommended it to me for keeping my hands moist in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno products and it suits my skin (which is dry in winter)</li>
      <li>I have a large bottle in my room, so this has been a convenient solution for when not in the house.  </li>
      <li>It is absolutely unscented, as well.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing and healing -- no oiliness.  </li>
      <li>and I especially like that it is fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>Cost is reasonable so I cannot complain much.</li>
      <li>I really like Aveeno products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t tend to like unscented lotions, so I add some perfume oil to mine, and it still works really well.  </li>
      <li>I have eczema around my mouth, and I&#x27;ve always liked how soothing and long lasting this lotion feels.</li>
      <li>me first get this clear:</li>
      <li>I use this every few hours in the office or outside and it has really kept my hands in good condition.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the skin smooth and prevents skin from getting so dry that it cracks and bleeds.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy the little Aveeno for everywhere and this is a great size for the car and purse. Nourishing, but never greasy. This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing but not sticky. The ONLY hand lotion I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my fingers leave greasy residue everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have used many  moisturisers for  my dry hands ,but this is the best one.Would love to order for it again.</li>
    <li> I really like Aveeno products. I have tattoos and think this is the best stuff to apply. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that once the bottle is done, there is no way to unscrew the top and add more lotion. This just means that you have to buy another one of this size. I guess it&#x27;s a good business move for Aveeno, but it would be nice if they would be a little bit more consumer aware.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for hands and face. Will not use any other lotion now!</li>
    <li> very good lotion, I use it for moisture my hand, no fragrance; I like it</li>
    <li> Aveeno is great period!</li>
    <li> Nice.  Moisturizes and absorbs quickly with no lingering scent.  I have a lot of contact allergies and Aveeno is my go to moisturizer.  I keep this size in my glove compartment and it is the right size for air travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Aveeno lotion.  My first encounter with Aveeno was when the dermatologist recommended it to me for keeping my hands moist in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first get this clear: I HATE lotion.  They make your hands smell and sticky/oily which leaves fingerprints everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even with my dislike of lotion, Aveeno definitely works around and does the job.  It keeps my hands moist but doesn&#x27;t make my hands oily/wet like other brands.  The scent is minimal and I actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 2.5oz for my needs during the winter.  I have a large bottle in my room, so this has been a convenient solution for when not in the house.  I use this every few hours in the office or outside and it has really kept my hands in good condition.  I also recommend this for use on your body too.</li>
    <li> Great Lotion for Moisturizing our hands!!! I Love Them!!</li>
    <li> I love it, i have almost 2 weeks using it and i can tell the difference in my skin, is softer, flawless... amazing product. Recommended  100%</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, find it everywhere&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight on skin, especially hands&lt;br /&gt;Seems to make skin soft/ velvety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;(I have an oily Tzone)&lt;br /&gt;If used as night cream, I make up with major shiny face. I&#x27;ve used caviar based products or Neutrogena before and never had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;If used as a moisturizer on face, ( I don&#x27;t see why I couldn&#x27;t do that ), I get a shiny face in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would def. not use it as a facial moisturizer especially if you have oily skin. Only a hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products for my very sensitive skins and this is a nice size to keep in the purse, drawer at work or anyplace I need.</li>
    <li> These work great in moisturizing. I suffer from dry skin, and this always gives me the moisture I need. I sometimes use it for my face and elbows.</li>
    <li> For home, I buy the 18 oz. twin pack.  This 2.5 oz size is perfect to keep at work and to take while traveling (carry on approved).  I have never found a lotion that works better.  Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion is especially good to use while at work because it does not leave an oily or greasy residue that makes hand slippery.</li>
    <li> My Wife uses this all the time but was trying to find the small size to pack for a trip. Couldn&#x27;t find it locally so was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does the job. I thought it will be better than this. Cost is reasonable so I cannot complain much.</li>
    <li> I deal with terrible dry, flaky, itchy and shiny skin on my forehead and around my nose. I asked my girlfriend to get me some kind of moisturizer for Christmas since she is a huge soap/lotion/face cleanser freak. She got me this and it has solved all my problems! In the morning I wash my face with an anti-shine facial cleanser and then apply this Aveeno lotion. It is thick so I only need to use a tiny drop (less than a pea) and rub it all over my face. It leaves my skin moisturized, flake-free, shine-free and incredibly soft the entire day! I&#x27;m so happy now that I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed by my face being dry and covered in flakes. I&#x27;ll probably continue to buy this stuff forever.</li>
    <li> Aveeno makes the best skin care products on the market and this particular size is very convenient for travel. It&#x27;s fragrance free so my wife and I can both use it when we travel. Good to have on hand when the hotel sheets irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> The lotion helps keep the skin moisturised and lasts long. It can be apply to any dry skin and it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
    <li> i love carrying this with around with me in my handbag. I have eczema around my mouth, and I&#x27;ve always liked how soothing and long lasting this lotion feels. My friends also love using this after they wash their hands. It&#x27;s a great lotion for everything really.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s low in dangerous chemicals and does leave your skin soft. Great way to tell if a product is good for your skin is to download the free app &amp;#34;skin deep&amp;#34;. This lotion scores a two which is pretty good. The scent is what gives it a mild allergy warning. Otherwise it would be a complete zero. So if you aren&#x27;t allergic to oatmeal sent then you are fine.  I have eczema so I use mine after I&#x27;ve let my coconut oil absorb. My skin doesn&#x27;t show any signs of eczema. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, this one is a smaller bottle. It&#x27;s great for your purse.</li>
    <li> Love it, softens my hands without making them feel greasy afterward and yay, I&#x27;m not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> VeryGood,But A little</li>
    <li> Good lotion for my dry hands, is one of the best lotion the market ! I really love it !!</li>
    <li> Always use Aveeno, it is a GREAT product. Softens skin wonderfully! without greasiness or irritation. Love it as an add-on item!</li>
    <li> Not particularly impressive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not  particularly impressive.</li>
    <li> This lotion does what it says.  It&#x27;s really, really moisturizing and soothing for dry winter skin.  I&#x27;ve got a few dry patches that only Aveeno seems to be able to sort out.  It is absolutely unscented, as well.  I don&#x27;t tend to like unscented lotions, so I add some perfume oil to mine, and it still works really well.  This is absolutely essential for me in the winter.</li>
    <li> No one can argue the quality. Was a little irritated by the quantity.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing effect good!</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products and it suits my skin (which is dry in winter)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy stuff like this, so keep in mind that I have little to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes get dry skin, in part because I never wear gloves in cold weather and also because I clean tools with harsh cleaners (soaps, WD40, etc) without gloves. I don&#x27;t bother with hand lotion because all of the stuff people have previously offered to me seems like it just makes your hands goopy, but otherwise doesn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year I was doing especially bad. My knuckles were so dry that my skin literally cracked in a few places, which causes painful little nearly-invisible wounds resembling paper cuts which hurt when I flex my fingers because all of the motion is concentrated on the ripped-open flesh. Yuck!  I was desperate and randomly grabbed this stuff at the 7-Eleven (the only thing they had) without researching as I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. After something like an hour or less (I didn&#x27;t push things too quick, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly when it got better), my skin is back to being flexible, and the lotion has dried or absorbed or whatever and I am simultaneously not dry or cracking, AND not dripping with goo.  I have a little bit of a rubbery grippy feel on my skin, but it&#x27;s not rubbing off on clothing or anything. And it remains that way for several hours (24 might be overstated, but twice a day seems to do the trick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient listed is dimethicone, which Wikipedia says is a polymer with both liquid and elastic properties. Thank you, technology. You have saved me when Mother Nature wanted my freaking skin to fall off.</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was for the face. I see it is for general use..however, I do use it on my face and it seems to be working just fine. I like the packaging with the squeeze bottle you can avoid contaminating the rest of the container.</li>
    <li> Bought this to toss in my bag for use at work and on the go. The product rubs in easily and is not greasy on the hands. I work constantly with paper at my job and also tend to wash my hands more often than most. Both of these activities tends to dry out hands and this lotion has been a real skin saver for me. I no longer have cracked skin with bloody knuckles from the drying paper and soap from washing. Small enough that I can keep one in my desk and one in my purse or backpack.</li>
    <li> Several people recommended this and so I bought some. I&#x27;m not unhappy with it but I&#x27;m not thrilled either. It works fine, though, and if you&#x27;re an Aveeno fan - as many people are - you will probably love it! Comes in a pack of two for a good price.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion but it&#x27;s a little more expensive than my local department store.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it is not greasy or oily and goes on smooth and absorbs well. It makes your skin feel soft and hydrated and it lasts a long time.  No funny or excessive scents either!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion, its not greasy, has no smell at all and it feels just great on my skin. Definetly worth it!</li>
    <li> Best product known to mankind.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my whif, She liked this very much!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin and need a portable moisturizer, this is the one.  I keep some of this in my car and in my office.  It goes on quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy-feeling residue.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing lotion worked well on skin that did not benefit from any other commercial moisturizers. It keeps the skin smooth and prevents skin from getting so dry that it cracks and bleeds. That is all I wanted this product to do, and it works perfectly for that. If anyone is looking for something that will keep your skin from getting too dry, this may be the product for you, unless you have some sort of underlying medical condition that would require the use of another product.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these little bottles on me all the time.  They&#x27;re in my purse, school bag, desk drawer, etc.  This lotion is wonderfully moisturizing without leaving a sticky residue and it has a *very* light oats/almonds scent that vanishes quickly.  I hate having to use any other lotion.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It is a good moisturizer and I especially like that it is fragrance free.  It is long-lasting which is helpful because I have really dry skin.  I wish I had been able to get  a larger size in this product.  I didn&#x27;t realize the tubes would be so small.</li>
    <li> Was listed as face lotion. It&#x27;s not. But it&#x27;s still good lotion</li>
    <li> It smells as expected, like lotion without perfume, which is great if you hate having too many different smells around, clashing with perfume and such. And the lotion really keeps your skin nice. I use it 1x a day, every day for over a year now.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. I keep it to have in my back pack and carry it in a purse.</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion, great travel size. I like to keep one at my desk and one in my backpack. Very nice and lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> I hate a greasy-feeling hand lotion.  Usually during the day I wear Aloe Vera hand gel which leaves no residue but is a bit drying.  At night I use this product because it&#x27;s a better moisturizer.  Look carefully at the pricing where there is great variance on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great basic moisturizer for the money!  The shipping was fast thank you !!!</li>
    <li> I brought it by mistake for I already have 2 big bottle. But I really love aveeno.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy, not greasy. Does a great job keeping your hands from drying out and cracking.</li>
    <li> Good product, lighter weight lotion than I expected.</li>
    <li> I think it was good because of no fragrance. But for my extremely dry skin, it was just not enough....</li>
    <li> I like Aveeno for its lake of perfumed smell. Also this particular size is great for travel. I use it every day and have great skin.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream - I have been using it for quite a while now and it is great. It is a great size too, fits right in your bag if you want to carry it with you every day. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very soothing and healing -- no oiliness.  One nice surprise -- I left it in my car during a prolonged freeze and it stood up perfectly.  So I tried during a hot summer, and no change -- so now I leave one in my car all the time.  (I tried this with other moisuturizers and some separated.)</li>
    <li> If you traveling to somewhere coupld of day .Then you should have one in your bag .Is small but help you feel better</li>
