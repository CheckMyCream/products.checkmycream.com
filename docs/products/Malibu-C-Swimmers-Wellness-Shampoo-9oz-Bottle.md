      <li>I don&#x27;t like  the Malibu C conditioner, but I love the shampoo!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It removes all&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;green&amp;#34; out of blond hair and makes it super silky!!  </li>
      <li>I swim exercise laps in a chlorinated pool two or more days a week.</li>
      <li>and I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>so it is great to have something gently remove all the chemicals from my hair.  </li>
      <li>So, I am satisfied with my purchase and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>I swim almost every day and my hair has been in much better condition since using this product</li>
      <li>It my daughter&#x27;s favorite brand of all that she has tried.</li>
      <li>I wonder if I could use it more than once or twice a week, since I swim everyday.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Cleans off all of the pool chemicals off my hair and body and makes my hair all silky and smooth!</li>
      <li>This 30oz+ container is just right and a good price.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I found it was available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The 3oz bottles are available at most pharmacies.  </li>
      <li>It would probably work even better if we used the Malibu conditioner, but we opted to try it without the Malibu kind initially to see if it worked OK (it did!).  </li>
      <li>HANDS DOWN best product I have ever bought on amazon.  </li>
      <li>It works great on white blond hair!  </li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast, and the top was taped, so the item arrived intact.</li>
      <li>I rarely ever use conditioner because the shampoo does such a good job getting the chlorine out.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on my own hair and it really didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
      <li>We will likely use this for many years to come!</li>
      <li>Use it as body wash and shampoo after swimming, but follow up with a 2nd wash with my own shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who spends any significant time in the pool.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and gentle enough to use all the time!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine as a daily shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect it to help at all with chlorine.</li>
      <li>It is very helpful for taking away the chlorine smell off my skin and hair.</li>
      <li>really saves the hair</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo for my 6 year old daughter who is in the pool daily.  </li>
      <li>Very economical bought it for the swimmer in our family after using a smaller size from a Pro shop.</li>
      <li>the instructions for return made it clear that I would be responsible for the cost of return shipping.</li>
      <li>I swim nearly every day and this shampoo really does keep the chlorine out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>IUt&#x27;s economical to get the larger size.  </li>
      <li>It seems like the chlorine levels at the pool vary from week to week and whether its strong or weak this shampoo makes my hair feel clean</li>
      <li>It also works enough as a conditioner that her long hair is easily combed.</li>
      <li>This is my third bottle of Malibu shampoo and I&#x27;m pretty convinced</li>
      <li>This was my first time buying anything on Amazon except books, and will be my last.</li>
      <li>My hair is now back to normal and very manageable.  </li>
      <li>I think it is a must if you are in the pool frequently.  </li>
      <li>large container will last me a long time!</li>
      <li>Since using this shampoo, I have stable hair color and no dry ends.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s expensive purchased locally.  </li>
<li> I purchased this shampoo after moving to Arizona where the water is HARD</li>
<li> ( I blame that on the hard water though)</li>
<li> Very messy and left disappointed.</li>
<li> She has used it daily and her hair is still horrible.  </li>
<li> it has helped with tangles and the bad look chlorine can leave.  </li>
<li> Purchased this in an effort to restore my daughter&#x27;s horrible chlorine hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gets the chlorine out of my hair.  However, you&#x27;ll probably still need a conditioner. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I swim almost every day and my hair has been in much better condition since using this product</li>
    <li> A great product! Good for your hair and getting the chlorine out and also makes a wonderful liquid soap for the body. I love it! It was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> The items shipped were not Malibu-2000 as stated and indicated on the invoice.  Items were \\&quot;Malibu\\&quot; an entirely different and arguably inferior product.</li>
    <li> I swim exercise laps in a chlorinated pool two or more days a week. My hair cutter said my hair was getting stiff and course.  It&#x27;s especially a problem as hair turns gray.  She suggested this Malibu brand.  It&#x27;s very, very effective.  My hair is now back to normal and very manageable.  It&#x27;s expensive purchased locally.  This 30oz+ container is just right and a good price.  I decant it into one of the 3oz bottles needed to pass through TSA checks at the airport.  The 3oz bottles are available at most pharmacies.  A 30oz+ bottle lasts a year!</li>
    <li> Cleans off all of the pool chemicals off my hair and body and makes my hair all silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> My cousin who is a hair stylist recommended this to me.  This is my third bottle of Malibu shampoo and I&#x27;m pretty convinced this all I&#x27;ll ever use from now on.  I&#x27;m a former competitive swimmer that still gets in 2-4 times a week for fitness.  It seems like the chlorine levels at the pool vary from week to week and whether its strong or weak this shampoo makes my hair feel clean and I&#x27;ve yet to get the straw look or feel.  I rarely ever use conditioner because the shampoo does such a good job getting the chlorine out.  I would highly recommend to anyone who spends any significant time in the pool.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo a lot.  I wonder if I could use it more than once or twice a week, since I swim everyday.&lt;br /&gt;This large container will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after moving to Arizona where the water is HARD and I was swimming in a pool a couple times a week.  My hair is gray/silver and was concerned about it turning yellow from the hard water and pool chemicals.  I learned recently the pool is a salt water pool, so my concern about contact with harsh chemicals has been diminished somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of the shampoo, I need a good amount to achieve a lather ( I blame that on the hard water though) and I have not seen that yellow cast to my gray/silver hair that I was trying to prevent.  So, I am satisfied with my purchase and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said, this is not Malibu 2000 as advertised. It is Malibu Swimmers&#x27; Water Action, and does not work as well as Malibu 2000, as I know from past experience. It is going back! The shipping was super fast, and the top was taped, so the item arrived intact.</li>
    <li> Our kids are on swim team and we have tried several products in hopes of keeping their hair managable.  This is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it every time after I swim laps. I am so glad I found it was available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo for several years. It is very helpful for taking away the chlorine smell off my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I swim, do water aerobics and deep water strength training 6 days a week. This is the only product that takes the chlorine smell out of my hair and skin. I use it daily as a body wash and I wash my swimsuit in it. It neutralizes the harmful chlorine. One little squirt on my scrubby net puff is all it takes !</li>
    <li> I have two daughter, both with blonde hair.  One is on a swim team, the other is a lifeguard and a swimming teacher.  They both spend a lot of time in the pool.  This is the only product I have found that really keeps their hair from turning green.  I don&#x27;t like  the Malibu C conditioner, but I love the shampoo!</li>
    <li> I ordered Malibu 2000, and received Malibu---might be the same, but it does not work as well as the Malibu 2000 that was used in the salon.  The shampoo was open when it arrived and I had hundreds of packaging peanuts covered with shampoo---the instructions for return made it clear that I would be responsible for the cost of return shipping. To pay 20.00 for shipping for a 20.00 purchase seemed pretty pointless. This was my first time buying anything on Amazon except books, and will be my last.</li>
    <li> really saves the hair</li>
    <li> Use it as body wash and shampoo after swimming, but follow up with a 2nd wash with my own shampoo.  It seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Works great, removes chlorine.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo for my 6 year old daughter who is in the pool daily.  Her hair was like straw due to the pool.  It also works enough as a conditioner that her long hair is easily combed.</li>
    <li> It works great on white blond hair!  Although it leaves it a bit dry, it never turns green and that&#x27;s the key!</li>
    <li> My kids are competitive swimmers.  If it wasn&#x27;t for this product their hair would be like straw.  It my daughter&#x27;s favorite brand of all that she has tried.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted...Yeah!  No longer does my color bleach out!  IUt&#x27;s economical to get the larger size.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> does a great job of getting the chlorine smell and feel out of my hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo!  Our water is very hard and it was very obvious in my hair.  This shampoo makes my hair shine and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I&#x27;m in a pool all the time so it is great to have something gently remove all the chemicals from my hair.  Smells nice and gentle enough to use all the time!</li>
    <li> Leaked about a quarter of the bottle throughout the box. Very messy and left disappointed.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my daughter who was swimming every day...it has helped with tangles and the bad look chlorine can leave.  I typically put it in her hair and let it soak for about 5 minutes and then we use regular conditioner.  It would probably work even better if we used the Malibu conditioner, but we opted to try it without the Malibu kind initially to see if it worked OK (it did!).  We will likely use this for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I swim nearly every day and this shampoo really does keep the chlorine out of your hair.  I have used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Purchased this in an effort to restore my daughter&#x27;s horrible chlorine hair.  She has used it daily and her hair is still horrible.  I tried it on my own hair and it really didn&#x27;t do much.  It&#x27;s fine as a daily shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect it to help at all with chlorine.</li>
    <li> I swim everyday and have been using this shampoo for about 3 years.  I color my hair and used to have problems with fading and the ends turning orangey.  Since using this shampoo, I have stable hair color and no dry ends.</li>
    <li> Great value and works well at removing chlorine from hair and body</li>
    <li> Smells like orange juice</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for swimmers like me.  I think it is a must if you are in the pool frequently.  I swim about 7500 yards per week and this stuff rinses the chlorine out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Very economical bought it for the swimmer in our family after using a smaller size from a Pro shop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before but my salon no longer carries it.  I was glad to find it on line and the service was great.</li>
    <li> I have white hair and have had green hair since starting water exercises.  This shampoo takes all the green from the swimming pool out of my hair.  Leaves it feeling great.</li>
    <li> HANDS DOWN best product I have ever bought on amazon.  It restores swimmers hair. It removes all&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;green&amp;#34; out of blond hair and makes it super silky!!  I hope I can continue to buy this for many years to come!</li>
