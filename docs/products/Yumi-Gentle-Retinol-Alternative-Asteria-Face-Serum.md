    <li> I bought this product for my mom. She is really love this. It works for her.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it after washing my face at night before bedtime. It smells good and applies smoothly. My skin feels softer, silkier and more supple. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this product! If you have sensitive skin this is a MUST have!! Trust me my husband even uses it and he is sensitive to everything!</li>
    <li> It has a cool refreshing feel as you put it on.</li>
    <li> Love the way my face feels after I apply this, I do notice my skin seems to have a softer feel to it.</li>
    <li> Not seen any noticeable results as yet.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous. I have very sensativity skin and I am not a big fan of the retinol containing prodcuts so I figured I would give this a try and boy am i happy. It has made my skin so very soft  and I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions and I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after a few weeks of use:)</li>
    <li> Great product... fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using ASTERIA for over 2 weeks and have seen dramatic improvement in my fine lines around my lips and eyes already.  I will continue using this product forever!</li>
    <li> really enjoyed using this product. I have sensitive and dry skin and this product really help. my skin looks a lot better after applying and doesn&#x27;t give me that nasty, oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Willing to try it and leave futher feedback.</li>
    <li> I really how this serum feels on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling to it nor does it have a strong smell as well, which I like very much. Most Serums like this I try always leave a heavy feel to it but this one didn&#x27;t. It felt so light. I really like how the serum is light blue since that&#x27;s my favorite color and how the bottle is shaped is made. When I applied this to my face, this neither caused any irritations or red marks at all. It just feels really nice and soft Then after a few moments, it soaked into my skin. Overall, I like this product and I will recommend this to may family members and friends.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how this moisturized my face without irritating it. I have sensitive skin and usually when a product says it will help my skin without irritating it, it doesn&#x27;t. I used the product a few times before I would review just to make sure that it worked, and it did!</li>
    <li> Being in my early 30&#x27;s I recently decided it was time to try out some products that helped with aging skin (which is something no woman ever wishes to think about, but we know we must at some point in life) After reading about a large discount on Yumi Beautiful - ASTERIA Skin Care Retinol Alternative from a blog I follow I decided to take the plunge and give it a try. I was NOT disappointed! Although I am no expert when it comes to anti-aging products I know my skin and I know when a product I&#x27;m using makes a difference and this product most definitely did. My skin was oh so much softer and more hydrated with a nice glow to it. I also noticed that the few lines I had on my face were softer and less apparent than before after a few weeks of use. I also love how light and non-greasy feeling the gel is as I have a very oily face to begin with. It also dries fairly quickly which is a plus.  The only downside to this item (and the reason I only gave it four stars) is that being someone on a budget it is far too pricey for such a small bottle that runs out far too quickly, otherwise I would most definitely have given it 5 stars. It is for sure a product worth trying that I have already recommended to others!</li>
    <li> I like to wear this under my normal moisturizer.  I alternate this with the vitamin c serum morning and night.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, is not sticky.  A+++</li>
    <li> Love using this! Feels so fresh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I loveeee this brand!!! All this products work perfect, they are great! Some expression lines that I have in my face are fading away thanks to Yumi! My skin feels and seems young love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month now, I feel much improved on my skin. Now I feel the skin is firmer and more elastic. It is best to apply at night before go to sleep!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using all the Yumi products and very satisfied with all them. The retinol too harsh leaves my face soft and  smooth and my wrinkles  less noticeable. Will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> not bad but doesn&#x27;t make any different with my other product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 days &amp; will update at 2 weeks with results. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the texture, but it does feel like it is helping with my dry spots.</li>
    <li> Face turns to good condition after applied this product. I like it alot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a magic and good product.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging the way it looks and just the product overall. It&#x27;s amazing. I would honestly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Very light and makes my skin feel very smooth!!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this item but unfortunately developed an allergic reaction once I tried it.</li>
    <li> good~good~good~good~good~verygood~</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t believe any product can make you look younger, so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this or any other product like &amp;#34;your wrinkles just fly away and you look 20 years younger&amp;#34;. No, my purpose was to improve skin. I cannot use regular retinol products because of face sencivity. This product works great. I was soooo scared to used it first time, I expected red skin. But to my surprise, my skin felt great, not dry, no red. In few days my face looks brighter, fresh, I enjoy what I see in mirror, and no side effects for me, which is great. Totally worth a try!</li>
    <li> Shipping is quick and the product is also good performance.</li>
    <li> So far im loving this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product only one day. I don&#x27;t notice a change at this point, but I can happily say that I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning, itching, or skin irritation. It is nice to find a product like this gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Loved this product works really great!!</li>
    <li> I was looking to improve my current skin routine my existing face wash and go was far from ideal.  I have only ben using this product for a few days and so far I love the results.  The serum is not sticky and absorbs quickly while still leaving my skin feeling moisturized.  I do pair it with a moisturizer as the directions state you can for additional skin benefits.  My skin is definitely looking more lustrous these days.</li>
    <li> I love it. Arrived quickly and well packaged and I have been using it everyday. I have had less breakouts since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used and love this product!</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate at all. Feels great!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product for the price. Not too harsh, leaves my face feeling light and fresh. Amazing value, would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this product! Not harsh to my skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product to pamper my face. It makes my face so soft and smooth, giving good protection from the pollutants in the air. I&#x27;m loving my Yumi ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum.</li>
    <li> regarding the quality of the serum, It is pretty satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I felt my arid skin is moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;However, Its push button is somewhat faulty, I spoiled some liquid when I use the product.</li>
    <li> So far, product has worked well. It does a great job of moisturizing my skin. It also has a pleasant smell. Looking forward to trying it further.</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied with this product. Wrinkles seem to get less noticeable after a few days.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it dried my skin out, but really it was the eww stuff coming off so that I my radiant skin could emerge!</li>
    <li> I use it after washing, makes me feel even more clean... don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working on wrinkles/blemishes though.</li>
    <li> quick absorbing, non scented facial serum. Feels like water going on and leaves your skin feeling soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> Love YUMI products!  My skin thanks me for the pampering.  I was able to get this during a special promotion and so glad I did!</li>
    <li> Works well. I have purchased this more then once</li>
    <li> Great retinol product, light scent, affordable price</li>
    <li> I absoutly love this! I can honestly see a difference in my skin from before I used it to now.</li>
    <li> Skin is smoother since using this. Love it!</li>
    <li> You are probably asking yourself the same thing I was when Yumi Beautiful sent me this serum to review for them.  What is Asteria Anti-Aging Serum?  It&#x27;s basically an alternative to Retinol.  It contains Natural Asterias Peptides, that act in a way that is similar to Retinol but it doesn&#x27;t have some of the harsh side effects that Retinol can have.  That&#x27;s why the ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum by Yumi Beautiful works perfectly for people that normally have a sensitivity to Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum in place on my normal Retinol serum for a few weeks and I have had great results.  It definitely helps diminish the look of some of my fine lines and the Hyaluronic Acid also helps plump up my skin and leaves it feeling well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Being a beauty blogger and a bit of a package snob I simply must talk about the packaging for this ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum!  How gorgeous is this bottle?  It&#x27;s hard to believe but it&#x27;s even more beautiful in person!  It&#x27;s one of those bottles that you would love to have sitting on your bathroom counter because it&#x27;s just pretty to look at!&lt;br /&gt; have been blessed because I have had the chance to try all of the Yumi Beautiful products and they have all been fantastic, great quality products that deliver real results!</li>
    <li> Loved it clears your face in no time</li>
    <li> Love this product and I can really see a difference!</li>
    <li> My wife will be very good. The wife want to buy more.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Delivery was awesome</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Will purchase more once I finish this bottle</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s best item that I have ever got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll really recommend this!!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> feeling is so good, I really like it.</li>
    <li> it is easy to apply to the whole face. I feel my skin get more moisturized.</li>
    <li> This feels so soothing when putting it on. Does not leave my face oily or dry feeling, just very soft. Very happy with the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see further results with further use. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> As always yumi comes through. Love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. Also, since I&#x27;ve started using it, I don&#x27;t have to use face lotion :)</li>
    <li> It really works! I recommend this for all skin types.</li>
    <li> very nice retinol skin</li>
    <li> A&amp;#34;Yumi Gentle Retinol Alternative Asteria Face Serum&amp;#34; is good to moisturize my skin. Moist and absorption power is good.</li>
    <li> Yumi products are wonderful and this one is no exception.  I feel like it gets results and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin!</li>
    <li> It feels good. My face looks brighter and feels smoother</li>
    <li> My sister loves it. She has a problem trying out any skin care item that contains retinol because it causes these tiny little bumps on her face. This is gentle and made her face looking smooth. As for anti-aging, we don&#x27;t see the difference but maybe in a couple more weeks for the product to fully kick in.</li>
    <li> This product is average..</li>
    <li> useless. it actually dried up corners of my mouth...still hurting..</li>
    <li> feels very nice on the skin!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant that this would burn my face or make me uncomfortable but I don&#x27;t get those side effects at all.  Very mild and I really like it!</li>
    <li> I like this serum I feel my skin softer and improving with my wrinkles.no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin since I started using it. It&#x27;s suppose to help with wrinkles (which I&#x27;m trying to prevent).</li>
    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for almost a month now. I wanted to use it first before leaving a review. The product itself is amazing works just like the package says it will. I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in the wrinkles in my face. My only complaint is that when you press the pump to get the product it kinda squirts everywhere. But I wouldn&#x27;t use that as a reason not to buy. This product is awesome. I&#x27;m happy I found this in my life!</li>
    <li> works pretty well, and much cheaper than cosmetic surgery!</li>
    <li> The retinol cream didn&#x27;t do an incredibly life-transforming feat on me but it did work out quite well to smooth things over... not sure if any better than lotion or any other cream but I&#x27;m a guy so take my word with a grain of salt, eh? Felt nice though.</li>
    <li> Tis product is good. It&#x27;s really helpful. And fast deliever.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels.  Started using it a few nights a week to let my skin get used to it.  Then every day worn no issues.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, but my skin did seem a bit more moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have been using this with my mom and we both love how it has made the laugh lines around our eyes visibly smaller and it makes our skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I was afraid like with other retinol products I have tried it would burn or leave my skin red. This did not happen. So worth the try, can&#x27;t wait to continue using it! Thanks Yumi</li>
    <li> This goes on so smooth and helps keep my face hydrated. I love it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a week. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference but I will say that it does leave my skin feeling refreshed and it is gentle on the skin, I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 days so far... And I was extremely skeptical of this product....let me tell you that the first night that I used this all the clogged pores legit came out on their own! No bull! I woke up to go to the bathroom and was like... What the?!? And all the annoying pores on my cheeks and nose that are HUGE have came unclogged!  I didn&#x27;t know that was one of the things that this would do! I thought it was going to soften my skin and take away wrinkles !  I have been fighting my super huge pores my whole life!  I will re do my review with a before and after once I use my whole bottle!  But so far this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> It is like nothing I have ever tried before.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using it I noticed a difference and it is not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> The product was sticky.  No matter how long you waited it was still sticky.  I have used a lot of skin care products over the years and never ran into something like this.  Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I can tell it is working to improve my skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> love it, use it everyday</li>
    <li> I love that this product absorbs quickly and is not greasy feeling. It is very light &amp; airy. I have noticed my skin looks and feels so much better. It is like I can turn back the clock on aging. Also, you only need to use a little as it glides smoothly all over.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Good Quality!!</li>
    <li> Oh~~my skin for goood, thanks</li>
    <li> This feels great on the skin has a really nice  consistently.</li>
    <li> Feels silky smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling after applying. It dries quickly. I got this for prevention rather than correction and have not noticed a change is skin. I have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s soft and feel good</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and got it at a fantastic price!  Works wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I used for 1 mouth, this is really good to my skin</li>
    <li> Used the full bottle and honestly didnt see any difference!!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this product and one pump is all you need one pump to use on your entire face!</li>
    <li> Love this and it&#x27;s NOT greasey</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and a great price. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was getting a lot of skin irritation and decided try this product out. This product ended up being exactly what i needed! It leaves my skin feeling smooth without over drying or peeling!  I am very satisfied and will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> It is fine.   I received the product on Nov. 19. It seemed like a great offer. The 0.5 oz.is almost gone. The remainder in the oversize bottle contains a big old bubble. It feels just like aloe vera gel with a light &amp; pleasant scent. It disappears into my skin quite fast.  I went away for the holiday leaving another product at home that I use daily with great results. My skin already looks older using the Yumi by itself. Maybe it has not had enough time to do it&#x27;s thing.</li>
    <li> I love that this product</li>
    <li> The bottle was so nice I honestly didn&#x27;t even want to use it. But I&#x27;m glad I over came that and did because I really love this brand. Yum products have become a staple in my routine!</li>
    <li> This is a great product does not make my skin breakout like the other products do</li>
    <li> I have to say, I LOVE this product, but am extremely disappointed in the pump applicator.  I left you a message on your Facebook site regarding this matter as well, but never heard back.  Even when you depress the applicator even the tiniest bit, the product shoots far across the room causing such a waste of product.  There has been more product on the floor than on my face,  A TERRIBLE WASTE, don&#x27;t know if I received a damaged bottle or if the pump is just of inferior quality.  :(</li>
    <li> I am really loving this serum. A little goes a long way. A staple product</li>
    <li> Ohhh, I just love this product. My skin has improved much since I started using Yumi beautiful. It feels so good going on, silky smooth. My face no longer looks sixty. Try it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this product too soon, because I only 37 and I am a personal trainer who takes good care of myself. My diet is good. My health care is good. I don&#x27;t smoke. So, I don&#x27;t have lot of wrinkles yet to be able to judge the product on. But, after 3 weeks the fine lines that I had by my eyes are gone, and some of my freckles seem lighter in color. The bottle is very nice. One pump delivers the perfect amount for me- and with the bottom raising up- non of the product is wasted. I would recommend this product over a retinol any day.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. She tried it last night and this morning. She said she likes it, The texture is nice and absorb fast. It keeps her skin moist the whole night while we have the heater . But she got a little tingling sensation when she put it on but no red rash on my face. She said if everything works well after a period of time, she will buy it again. I think I did a good job this time!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.It is gentle and effective.It leaves me skin feeling much healthier and younger.Thank you YUMI for an amazing line of products!!!</li>
    <li> This product works, and the price makes it very worthwhile!</li>
    <li> Those few concentrated drops are super-efficient. Serums are made of very small molecules, so the skin absorbs them quickly and deeply. &amp;#34;The thicker, heavier ingredients in creams form a barrier on your skin,&amp;#34; Wilson says. &amp;#34;That&#x27;s great for locking moisture in. But it can also lock active ingredients out. Without these hindrances, the active ingredients in a serum penetrate your skin faster and more effectively.&amp;#34; They&#x27;re great for people with oily skin, or those who prefer a weightless feel to their skin care products. Serums have a non-greasy finish and they don&#x27;t leave behind a sticky residue. Copied from another site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a bunch of anti aging serum. I really like this one because I have seen a lot of improvement in the little time that I have used it. I really enjoyed how it helped my complexion and how my face feels. I would recommend this product to someone looking for a less harsh sercum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Light scent and slightly tacky consistency when you first apply.&lt;br /&gt;I have to follow up with a moisturizer because my skin needs the extra moisture&lt;br /&gt;but this has been a GREAT SERUM. you can easy spend way more money on a lesser product.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will thank you !!</li>
    <li> I like it, I use right after I cleanse my whole face and neck and I put it on. It feels great on my skin. Right after it soaks into my skin I put a moisturizer on and go. I usually use this product in the morning.</li>
    <li> Yumi Beautiful has a new anti-aging facial serum out that I have had the chance to review. I am always skeptical when it comes to serums and am concerned if I will break out due to changes in my normal daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out by applying once in the morning. I only applied a little bit and rubs it on my face. It was completely dry within a few minutes and I was able to go about my normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contains retinol which we all know is an anti aging ingredient that can work miracles. My face after a week and a half already feels a little firmer and my lines are also not so noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this till the bottle runs out and post before and after pictures than. I know this bottle will last at least a month am I am sure I will see even more results by than.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This serum has a light, pleasant scent. It made my skin feel smooth without feeling tight, and made fine lines less visible.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered really quickly! Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t care for it. I noticed no changes or benefits other than a slight tightening which disappeared once I put my moisturizer on over it. I am 48 years old, and have been looking for something to counteract or slow the signs of aging which seem to be more and more obvious daily! Lol I have no problem with the Yumi brand, I love the rosehip seed oil and vitamin c serum they carry. The Yumi representative I have spoken with and those I have emailed have been nothing but polite, patient, and very nice. I will definitely be purchasing other items from them.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft after applying. feeling refresh after. Will buy again when it is on sale.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I ordered this over the holidays while they were giving deep discounts on there products. I really like this serum. It feels so soft and not greasy like most serums that I have tried.It has as a minty cool feeling going on your skin. It has smoothed away my small lines I had on my forehead and evened out my skin tone. I will be ordering this again when I get close to running out of this one.</li>
    <li> not to harsh great stuff</li>
    <li> We received this product for free, the opinions are our own.  First of all, my wife didn&#x27;t have to deal with any irritation while using this product. It was easy to use and kind to her skin. She tried it on a particular area of her face where she saw some fine lines. My wife noticed immediately that her skin looked brighter and smoother, giving her a more youthful look. She will continue to use this product because she gets the results she wants, without any side affects.</li>
    <li> Love this. I am still using and experiencing results, but I am super pleased with the results that I am getting and i will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> The actual product is amazing. The problem is the container. The stuff shoots out everywhere and it is way more than you need for one application. While this product is GREAT for my skin I&#x27;m not sure that im ok with wasting so much of my money with it running out so quickly.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today and it made my skin felt so soft and glow!!</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels younger as a result of using this product. They make some of the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking how I&#x27;m havering that &#x27;fresh faced look&#x27; with this!</li>
    <li> feeling the freshness</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have acne and it has def helped my skin. In just a few days I see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Wife review: First time trying this brand. It was really light with a smooth feel, made my face feel fresh. I have problem skin so I have a ways to go before seeing major results. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Sticky texture but whatever</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now.  It is too soon to tell what kind of long term affects it will have, but I am pleased with the product thus far.  It is not harsh on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> Loving this product!!! I have added it to my regular skin care routine.  I love the light feeling, non sticky feeling, and nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product and I like it a lot. I use Lancome Visionaire perfecter to help with the expression lines on my forehead. It is very expensive at $79 for 1 oz. So far with this product, I feel I get very close if not the same results as the visionaire. So as long as the price stays relatively inexpensive then it is a fabulous product and a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if it gets closer to the $40 price, the less I would recommend. The reason for this is because it is not as high quality as visionaire. The bottle is very, very cheap. When I first opened it, the inside part of the lid was still stuck on the bottle. The pump on the bottle is horrible, it gets stuck every time and then shoots out a huge glob all over my hand. The product itself is like a gel and leaves my face feeling tight and sticky. There is no way I could not add lotion after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these problems occur with the Lancome product, it is a very nice bottle, wonderful pump, and the product is like silk on your face with no need for lotion unless one wants it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, this product is being sold at $33/0.5 oz&lt;br /&gt;You can get Visionaire for $79 1.0 oz or $115 for 1.7 oz which equals $39.50 or around $36 for the larger size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the savings of a few dollars I&#x27;ll probably stick with Visionaire but if the price drops lower say more of a $10 per 0.5 oz then I&#x27;d buy the Yumi.</li>
    <li> After using this for a week I can see less fine lines in my face!</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff!!  It is a gel-like serum and absorbs quickly yet leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. In the morning this alone is fine, but in the evening I like to add something heavier on top for more moisture/hydration.  I have noticed a difference in my skin tone, elasticity, hydration and appearance since using this product. Love it!!! Maybe an eye serum next.......</li>
    <li> Great consistency, mild pleasant scent.  Quality Product.</li>
    <li> This item is very good quality.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference yet. But just started using. Smells a little weird but then so do most face creams. I do like the gel consistency and it feels refreshing. May be a little to sticky for my taste. Overall its ok but just started it.</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase Yumi Gentle Retinol Alternative Asteria Face Serum with the help of a promotional code.  I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference yet however I can say my skin feels much smoother. It has been gentle on my skin, no irritations or breakouts. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Good quality at affordable prices</li>
    <li> It is milder than others I&#x27;ve tried. Works fairly well. I real liked it on my hands followed with my favorite hand cream at night just before bed time. There was a huge improvement in my hands as their not dry at all even though it&#x27;s winter and I hand wash my dishes but my hands are soft and smooth. This worked better than a heavy cream and cotton gloves that I always used at night in winters past.</li>
    <li> After using for a week now I can honestly say I like this product..I have very sensitive skin and I was worried about breaking out but I havent! My skin is softer and it is slowly helping even out my skin tone..wil update more as I use it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! I had very large pores and with in a week they look so much smaller. I recived this product for free to review and I will be back to buy more!! Thanks😍</li>
    <li> Great product. No irritation at all, and will continue using this product</li>
    <li> The product has good quality. good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped and delivered on time. It is also well packed and protected. I like its smell (light &amp; fresh) and have applied on my neck for about 2 weeks. It has made the skin smoother but it is a bit sticky while putting it on. I plan on trying it on my face tonight and will come back to update my review. There is a problem with the pump. It&#x27;s not easy to press and very difficult to control the amount (always comes out too much).</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and blends in nicely.</li>
    <li> I honestly can say I literally started using this less than a week ago. I went to my esthetician today who normally arches my eyebrows for me every two weeks. She told me that she noticed my skin looked very even and thought I was wearing some really good foundation, until she tried to wipe it off and saw I wasn&#x27;t wearing any. I love using this and will look forward to using it in the future!</li>
    <li> My skin looks radiant</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Yumi product that I have purchased and it is amazing! It absorbs into your skin quickly and I love that it isn&#x27;t harsh. No redness. I received the product quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a birthday gift to my mother in law. She was so happy when she knew it&#x27;s anti aging, and she told me that she can&#x27;t wait to use that!</li>
    <li> I LOVE YUMI PRODUCTS THEY ARE GREAT</li>
    <li> At first I did not receive my purchase, but once I notified Yumi, they expedited another bottle out to me right away.  I have been using the serum for about a week and do not see any noticeable changes around my eyes.  I was also using it around my lips but stopped because it seemed too drying and made them look worse.  However, I am now using it on my neck and chest and hopefully will see results there.</li>
    <li> Looks like there are great ingredients. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but worth the price just for the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Ship fast and nice packaging. Overall I like the serum to soak into my skin not feel like its laying on my skin, but i have noticed no change after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with retinol products for my face in the past.  Peeling, red, irritated skin just isn&#x27;t my idea of beauty.  This product is gentle and gives great results!  So happy to be a YUMI girl!</li>
    <li> My skin did not really like this product.  No better change in skin. Sometime caused a little stinging feeling.</li>
    <li> Looks like a good product and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Loving yumi products! I love the light feeling, non sticky feeling, and nice scent.. Works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I give a this serum for my wife and she is using it. I guess she is satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> Um... it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I makes my skin look so great. It&#x27;s easy to use and not greasy.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and good quality&lt;br /&gt;i use very well</li>
    <li> Really smooth great on dry skin perfect with a light moisturiser</li>
    <li> Just received this item yesterday and started using it...have not had it long enough to notice results yet but so far so good and there is no irritation!</li>
    <li> I bought this item twice because it&#x27;s so wonderful to use.  I have to get one for one of my best friends.  Love it~</li>
    <li> Good product,will buy it again</li>
    <li> Gave to my aunt as a gift. She seems elated about this product</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product but sometimes seems like it feels like my skin is a bit hot and burning slightly when I have used it.  Nothing too bad but maybe that means its working!</li>
    <li> Love the packaging.  I&#x27;ve been trying the product for about a week but haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference.  However, I&#x27;m happy with the product because it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of fragrance.  It&#x27;s a bit sticky, almost looks like gel.  The only problem is when trying to dispense, the pump dispenses a lot of product.  Therefore, I have to use more than I wanted.  Other than the pump, I will definitely keep trying this product.</li>
    <li> This is an Awesone product. Light and not harsh on my sensitive skin.  I would definately buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This one is an interesting product - admittedly, I used a retinol night cream that I purchased from a department store. I like the fact that this provides an alternative, as my skin is very sensitive and although the retinol night cream is effective, it occasionally leaves my skin red and flaky. This is by far the best alternative I have tried. It is very easy to apply and leaves my skin well-hydrated enough for me to not have to put on moisturizer after. I love that my skin feels a little bit tighter as soon as I apply this product. I have to say that I don&#x27;t use this product as often as I do for some of the other serums that I have purchased from Yumi Beautiful, but that is only because I don&#x27;t have as much of a need for it as I do the others. However, from what I have tried, I am definitely impressed so far!    I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this product. Well we love the entire Yumi Beautiful products so this buy was a no brainer. Trying to keep our skin nice and firm. Thanks again. I would def recommend this to family and friends. Super fast shipping. Even in the holidays.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful. It&#x27;s the first serum I&#x27;ve been sent to review that I used every last drop of. It&#x27;s super gentle and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything like most of the serums I&#x27;ve tried. It leaves my face feeling tighter, brighter, and at least 5 years younger! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product. A little goes a long way. One pump can usually provide enough coverage for my face and neck.  I love products with Aloe, but they tend to be sticky and dry my skin. I have used it for about a week and it has not been drying to my skin at all. It did start out a little sticky, but that was only until it was completely dry. Once it is dry my skin feels soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;ve probably not used long enough to see major differences in lines and wrinkles, but the texture of my skin has improved since I&#x27;ve been using this.  Note: I received a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is awesome product... works great and I really enjoy it. Recommended!</li>
    <li> been using this for almost a week and can tell a huge difference on my skin... my face seems brighter and more healthy looking! Love it!</li>
    <li> Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s easy to apply and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a gift for mother. Shes very excited to try it out.</li>
    <li> With a new baby in tow, this has helped my baggy eyes!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom who has skin allergies and it was good on her skin. She has noticed her skin has become softer and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I had great expectations for this product and it did not disappoint. The product is great.</li>
    <li> I love Asteria by Yumi!! First let me just say my face is super sensitive, I can&#x27;t use many products because my face will instantly have a negative reaction usually because of the chemicals in them.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product just because in the past when I&#x27;ve tried products the results are usually not at all what they hyped it up to be.  I suffer from really uneven patchy skin, with dry spots and some adult acne. I used the product as recommended to apply after cleansed face and massage gently into face and neck. I applied it before bed so the product could soak into my skin overnight.  After a week of using this product I couldn&#x27;t believe the changes to my face, my skin was actually starting to look vibrant and firmer.  I continued to use the product for a few weeks and I&#x27;m in awe. I just really can&#x27;t believe how lucky I was to find this product.  My skin just keeps improving and even my acne has calmed down.  I would definitely recommend this product for anti aging but just an all over great facial serum, with no harsh retinol.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted rate to leave an honest unbiased review. Its awesome. No irritation or anything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice! After use it, I really can fell the tightness in my skin! Well, I can consider to purchase one more!</li>
    <li> I really like how the bottle looks, the beautiful blue and silver color solution. The serum comes out light blue and has almost no scent to it. If anything it smells like fresh water which I love. I applied an even layer of it over my face and neck and massaged it until it was fully absorbed. It left my face feeling cool and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s great about it is that it’s retinol free, which means that if you have a sensitive skin you definitely want to go with this facial serum, especially if you’ve experienced side effects as sensitivity, peeling, dryness and redness. This facial serum uses a natural alternative to retinol – sea star peptides. With aloe to soothe and cleanse; and hyaluronic acid to lock in hydration. After using the serum for over a week my skin is definitely softer and has gotten a little firmer. I will keep using it every day so that the results will be there and to keep my face looking better, as it reduced the fine lines.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but am having a difficult time with the pump.  It squirts out wildly and product goes all over the place.  I am not getting as much usage from it as I&#x27;d like due to this design flaw.  I&#x27;d prefer it on my face and not on my furniture.</li>
    <li> Wow! Skin feels and looks amazing. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Saw this on Amazon when searching for something else and thought what the hell I&#x27;ve tried everything else so I&#x27;ll give it a shot. Wow this stuff is great, it really works.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was happy to find such a nice alternative to retinol. This goes on nicely and has helped my skin feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month now.  Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
    <li> i love this eye cream it works awesome its easy to apply and also to get out of the bottle</li>
    <li> Great product. It feels good on my skin. Will post again after a little while to see results.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and excellent packaging. The serum makes my skin feel soft. I will know more as the effects of the serum when I&#x27;ve used it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT! I love the high quality and feel.</li>
    <li> I am very picky on face creams, because of my sensitive skin. I was nervous to try this last night.....used it. Mmm, not bad. No itching or burning....whew. I am 28 years old. I love it when people say &amp;#34;What? 28 years old? Stop lying!&amp;#34; Ha. If you have sensitive skin, be careful. If it gets itching, stop using.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  Works good. Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Just started using this and my skin does feel smoother. I think in the long run it&#x27;s supposed to help bring the younger fresher skin out. I use it both at night and in the morning under my moisturizer. Good packaging easy to use.</li>
    <li> it has nice scent and applies very nicely. But it&#x27;s extremely sticky  after 10 seconds of apply.</li>
    <li> it leaves a smooth feeling to the skin</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and goes on nicely. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my skin the morning after using this.  It is refreshing and quite enjoyable.</li>
    <li> So.. it&#x27;s too good for me</li>
    <li> This product feels great on the face. It sinks in to the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking shinny. I have sensitive skin and I like that the product does not cause any irritation. I would purchase from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it like long enough to notice if any wrinkles disappeared yet but I love the way it feels on my face. It moisturizes but not greasy. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> This item was received as part of a promotion. I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I can already notice the difference in my skins appearance. I have oily skin and other anti-aging products have clogged my pores leaving me with acne. At the age of 35, who has time for acne?? The non-greasy, lightweight, silky feel, creamy serum leaves my face soft and fresh with a healthy appearance. I even find it has even helped with my skin tone as well. It delivers great results! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but my face already feels firmer and looks more radiant!</li>
    <li> It works well. I used too much at first and it felt sticky. I eventually figured out what worked best for my skin and it felt wonderful</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer, I use it after washing my face, and it work well. I assume it is one of the aloe Vera expensive creams I like so much. I hate greasy creams, so Yumi is a good solution for me.</li>
    <li> Very useful! Feels nice on the skin! Good Product!</li>
    <li> this feel great on my face !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, I like it~</li>
    <li> LOVE this Yumi face serum. I can tell that my skin is firmer and more vibrant. It has helped reduce some of the fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Feels good, and feels like it works.</li>
    <li> Ok, got this as a promotional item and have to say I&#x27;m loving the bottle itself! Very cool design! I&#x27;ve used the product for 2 weeks now and it has made my skin feel very smooth and much better. I honestly love it</li>
    <li> My wife is using this every night. Need to buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> So glad that I got the opportunity to test out this product. I love it so much! Highly recommended ! :)</li>
    <li> Love the product..Has taken away alot of the dryness.. Thanks for the trial  use of your  product..</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and her skin is glowing. She has been using it for ab 2 weeks now and you can really see a difference in her skin. Her completion is looking better each day. Her skin is much softer than before.</li>
    <li> The shipping was extremely fast.  This serum keeps my face hydrated and my face feel a little tighter especially around my eyes.  I will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> Not too harsh, does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product. My skin has not experienced any irritation like when I have used Retinol.</li>
    <li> make my skin nice and feel good</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!! I get compliments on how radiant and smooth my skin looks!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice but dries my face out.</li>
    <li> Love this product. my skin feels firmer and more hydrated as soon as I apply it.  It&#x27;s gentle, non irritating and absorbs immediately without any greasiness.  Only been using it a short time but I have seen a noticeable improvement in fine lines. Will definitely buy again..</li>
    <li> My wife love these product lines and buying for our relatives.</li>
    <li> After using the Yumi Gentle Serum for the past couple days I have not seen a huge difference in my skin yet. I have been wanting to try a retinol serum and have had no irritation to my skin at all with this one. The packaging is beautiful and it feels light and goes on thinly on your face. I have noticed my skin being more brighter and glowing when I put it on. Love this product and can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in a couple months!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I got this for my sister and she has already used the entire first bottle. She says that it has helped with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry skin, like dry to the point of flakiness around my eyebrows and nose. There are fine lines around my eyes as well as at the corners of my mouth. While this didn&#x27;t all of a sudden transform my skin into that of a 16 year old, I was very pleased for what it did do for me. My fine lines seem to have faded and the flakiness has subsided without being oily. The serum absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave behind a tacky feel that some do. It looks like it will go a long way as I have only had to use a tiny bit for my entire face and top part of my neck. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The packaging is really nice.  Ive used this product fro 3 days now an already my face feels a lot firmer and definitly more smooth! I cant wait to see what continued use is goign to do.  Very exciting! I love it!</li>
    <li> This item has been working wonderfully!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great! I wear it under my moisturizer.  Non oily!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a week now and my face feels great. I have sensitive skin and have to be very cautious of what I put on my face and it&#x27;s working like a charm!</li>
    <li> Thanks for this gift very happy</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. What I can say is that it does not dry out my skin. I have had no negative skin reactions. The scent is very pleasant and light. Does not feel heavy on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and I am happy with Yumi thus far. I hope to see some results befor the bottle is gone. I&#x27;m hopeful</li>
