<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lotion, it was used at a hotel I visited in Miami and I HAD to have it.  The Bottle is HUGE!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  I have used it for years and it is hard to find.  It has a wonderful light scent and smells fresh!  Co-workers ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and I tell them, it is just my lotion.</li>
    <li> love this lotion... works great and goes right into skin.  not greasy</li>
    <li> Very light. Not greasy. Better for Summer months.</li>
    <li> Love this product -- great on sensitive skin -- no heavy smell.  I can&#x27;t remember how many large bottles I have gone thru&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love what it does for my skin.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it in the larger containers.</li>
    <li> An outstanding skin lotion. Just make sure the lotion is fresh and not rancid.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it.  Thank you, just what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion for all seasons. Has a nice clean scent as well. This is a huge bottle which will last you a nice long time. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> What a great price for such a large bottle. Love the sent and it&#x27;s not greasy. Ships quickly. Great seller thank you</li>
    <li> So light on the skin.  Smells very nice and softens the skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I love it smells great goes on my skin and absorbs great it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used alot‼️</li>
    <li> I LOVE this body lotion!!! I used the samples given at hotels when traveling and decided that this was the perfect lotion for me! The smell is very pleasant and refreshing. It does not have a heavy, greasy feel at all. I am very happy to have a quantity that will last me for a while.</li>
    <li> I love the nice, light, scent of this product. It smells like fresh, clean, soap. It goes on so smooth and light but does a nice job of moisturizing. I even use it on my face. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t look at the size and it&#x27;s HUGE!  I guess I won&#x27;t be purchasing one of these for a long time!</li>
    <li> I found a sample of this in a hotel room and really liked it. Tried to find it at the drug store with no luck. Once again, Amazon to the rescue. I love this. It is very light and absorbs right away. I even use it on my face instead of the product I was using. This size bottle will last me a long time at a very reasonable price. Very light sent. I have a problem with a lot of lotions breaking out my skin. Not this one.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feels soft and fast absorbent</li>
    <li> what can I say it is Neutrogena  A+  :)</li>
    <li> Love it!  Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Have used this lotion for years and it helps immensely with dry skin.  Just glad it is in a large bottle</li>
    <li> Neutrogena- what a solid company. This lotion is non-greasy in application and melts in to your skin rapidly. Even if you don&#x27;t rub it all the way in, I&#x27;ve noted left over streaks of lotion seep in within minutes. My legs are normal skin, leaning on the dry side and this lotion makes them absolutely silky. No residue on clothing either. Large bottle given the price- a favorite product, with a nice, light smell.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite lotion.  I have very dry skin and this works extremely well without being heavy and greasy.  It is almost non-fragrent and I like that too.</li>
    <li> i hv always used this lotion love it nothing else works</li>
    <li> tooooo much perfume smell.     Leaves distinct odor.</li>
    <li> The best light absorbing lotion!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.  Best light-weight lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This is a great lightweight moisturizer that does the job! I use it immediately after I shower and as much as I can during the day as it is lightweight and makes my skin feel great. I am 45 and have begun menopause and am seeing some slight changes in my skin (more dry) and I am getting more active with the moisturizer throughout the entire day to keep my skin nice and moisturized and non-crepey! I have recently lost about 20 lbs and we all know that that can show some &amp;#34;loosening&amp;#34; and crepiness of the skin. This moisturizer keeps that at bay and has a very pleasant light fresh fragrance that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always read about Neutrogena being a great product and I am now changing over to Neutrogena as I have been so far impressed with a few of their products that I have begun using!</li>
    <li> We have used Neutrogena Products for years and my husband loves this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Especially that it comes in a large bottle with a pump.  He slathers it on when he&lt;br /&gt;gets out of the shower as he is a sun lover and is in it a lot working in our yard&lt;br /&gt;and around our pool.</li>
    <li> What a great idea -- two fabulous Neutrogena products in one.  Works for me because I used to blend lotion and sesame oil in my hand to apply.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Usually lasts several months, but find I use more in Arizona.  Smells light and not too thick.</li>
    <li> I love the smell as it is the original smell, but it&#x27;s not strong enough!  Fades almost instantly after applying.  Needs to be MUCH stronger for my taste.</li>
    <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE....AND LIGHT ON THE SKIN</li>
    <li> Since discovering this body lotion, I have seldom used anything else.  I always use body lotion (older skin), but doesn&#x27;t like waiting too long for it to dry, before dressing.  This solves the problem, as it dries rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks on clothing.  My skin feels soft. z always order the 32oz size, as it is a long time before you have the worry of getting every drop out of the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great service! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells good and isn&#x27;t too thin putting on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Neutrogena&#x27;s lotion, Rainbath Gel, and Body Oil for over 20 years.  I don&#x27;t think the formula has ever changed - the scent, texture, and performance are phenomenal!  I use this lotion at night before bed, all over except face/neck.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, feels silky and sinks in quickly.  The scent is light and clean so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with winding down for sleep.  One of my all-time favorite products!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the greatest ! It is very light and never makes your skin oily. It soaks in fast for soft delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Most economical way to buy this great lotion.</li>
    <li> great product i love smells great use it on a dialy basis</li>
    <li> Good basic body lotion. Economical and of course the size lasts forever.</li>
    <li> My wife used this lotion when we stayed at a hotel and it&#x27;s what they left for guests.  4 stores later, she couldn&#x27;t find it so she ordered it.  She loves it</li>
    <li> Perfect light body moisturizer for summer mos. I am finishing my 2nd bottle and no, my pump does not use up every last bit of lotion. What I do is unscrew the top and use the &#x27;straw&#x27; part to scoop out a sufficient enough amount to use on my arms and legs. I would never use this during winter, I need body butters for that season.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and is light and perfect for everyday. I use in conjunction with the sesame shower oil for beautiful skin</li>
    <li> Goes on light. Not greasy. Improves the skin texture, and has a pleasant sent.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It is so light and smells nice too.  I first tried it at a hotel with their samples and had to get some.  It is nice to have the pump bottle as well</li>
    <li> My husband has psoriasis and he uses this after his shower and it has really made the difference.</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena body lotion every day on my face and love the product .thanks for caring it.</li>
    <li> I have use Neutrogena products for years now, and this lotion is the best that I have found thru out my 50 years of using different brands of body lotion.  This is the only brand of lotion I NOW purchase and this type of Neutrogena lotion, I have found to be the best of Neutrogena lotions. A small amount goes on smoothly and quickly blends INTO my skin. It does not have an overwhelming fragrance and the pump works to the end of the lotion in the bottle. I have sensitive skin... have to use sensitive laundry soaps.  I recommend this lotion as it works great on my dry sensitive skin, and I hope others who use it have the same results that I have had... as I am 80 years old now and have few wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t use any other lotions not even lotions that are &amp;#34;anti-aging.&amp;#34;  Simple... and successful lotion... does a great job.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for Montana winter&#x27;s I can find.</li>
    <li> This is by far a great all body lotion. Absorbs well and not greasy. Love that it is sold in a 32 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> Great scent and leaves skin silky smooth!</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery and super smooth</li>
    <li> I have used all  Neutrogena products for years! Me and my friends give Neutrogena body lotion light 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.</li>
    <li> I love how silky this lotion is and never leaves a greasy feeling. Not too light to deep moisturize and not heavy at all. I love this entire neutrogena line.</li>
    <li> Nice and silky long lasting</li>
    <li> Great lotion. 32oz seems like too much, but it is just the right size to thoroughly care for ones skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is light and does not cause skin break outs.  It has a nice scent and I really like it.  I would recommend it to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not in any way worth the price,reviews are very misleading,waste of money...</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to heavy and perfumed lotions. they make me feel like my skin is suffocating and I almost always have to wipe or even wash lotions off, especially from my face. The Neutrogena Body Lotion goes on lightly, soaks right in and leaves a delicate fragrance. It works so well that I can use it everywhere - even my face!</li>
    <li> Dry skin? Not anymore. The whole family loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it so helps my skin to stay hydrated, even through winters of heating and summers of swimming and more than one shower per day, ;)! Cannot recommend this product more highly!</li>
    <li> Works very well and has a clean smell..</li>
    <li> Love it!  Always have. Always will.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, still love it.  It smells nice too but with a light scent.</li>
    <li> This item also does all that was stated.  My wife.</li>
    <li> No heavy smell, no greasy feeling afterward. Light, clean and just perfect</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I will always buy it when I run out. Much less expensive than in the retail stores.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel very soft, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  very, very nice</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Body Lotion but the 32-ounce bottle is quite cumbersome.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it&#x27;s not greasy, and the light scent is just right! My only wish is that is was a little more moisturizing, since I have dry skin. It IS a good lotion to wear around others beause it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This body lotion is great to use when it&#x27;s hot outside because it&#x27;s very light and sinks into your skin quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy or heavy feeling on your skin, not to mention that you&#x27;re getting a giant-sized bottle at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lotion, however the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I will still like using it.  I do like most Neutrogena products, however it would be nice if the fragrance lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It leaves your skin soft without a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> have been using this lotion for years.  Not greasy.  Very difficult to find the large bottles.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and cannot find it in any stores in Houston, TX.</li>
    <li> Mother uses this twice aday.</li>
    <li> As described, packed well. Great product, great value, great seller, and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> This was the lotion provided in a hotel.  I loved it, and ordered my own!</li>
    <li> Wonderful body lotion, very hard to find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. My skin is smooth all day. My only complaint was the pump was broken when I received it. I assume that happened during shipping. I used an old pump from Neutrogena Rain Bath. Absolutely recommend this lotion. Especially for dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Yummy smell and clean feeling not sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this.  This is the scent that all Hampton Inns have in the rooms for you.  People always ask me what I have on.</li>
    <li> i HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE.  THE PRICE IS GOOD AND THIS SIZE LASTS ABOUT 2 MONTHS SINCE i USE IT EVERY DAY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, love it!</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion when I stayed at a Hampton Inn, I and fell in love with it. Great smell and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I use to find this on the shelf everyday, the only place I can find it today is on Amazon. It has a light, clean and airy smell. Non-greasy, however helps to keep your skin moist.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Smells like the beach and very smooth.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Smells great, light scent.  This is a huge bottle, at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great !!!  Leaves your body feeling soft with no sticky residue. Also, won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
    <li> I use this all winter on my face after shaving and my skin doesn&#x27;t crack in the cold.  Actually helps heal blemishes.  Doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. Also for men it&#x27;s odor free.  Not smelly like other face creams.</li>
    <li> Good smell. Light lotion</li>
    <li> Been my go-to for many years.  Not oily, keeps my skin hydrated.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> What is this! I have used Neutrogena for years and NEVER itched got hives red all over! Horrible! This is not my Neutrogena!  What is in this! Have never seen my skin like this! Red bumps hives itchy! Horrble!  Didnt think to keep the box because never had this problem. Used this since my teens! This has never happened before. So I ask what is really in this Neutrogena! Am so sick!</li>
    <li> Skin feels silky and LOVE the smell!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is very light &amp; perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> a light lotion&lt;br /&gt;love this!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion out there, I believe. I have issues with very dry skin all year round, and this is making a significant change! I love this and plan to continue to use it for years to come!</li>
    <li> I appreciate the product at such a good price and the quick and free shipping!!</li>
    <li> My girl asked this, so far no complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, not to greasy.  Came nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Looking for an alternative to the great Neutrogena Body Lotion (the original formula before they took if off the market for unknown reasons and replaced it with a poor imitation) - this stuff is the next best thing, so I guess my family will be using this from now on...</li>
    <li> Great moisturize, like they advertised no grease , I used every day, in this extremely cold weather in Chicago. Five starts</li>
    <li> Nice and light but not moist (thick?) enough for dry skin. I need to apply twice in 1 day.</li>
    <li> My very favorite lotion...such a simple but wonderful fragrance ...makes skin fees so soft. Worth it&#x27;s price!!</li>
    <li> been using for years. love it.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever! Silky smooth!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for the quality, amount and price! My skin is quite dry, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it in winter, but it&#x27;s been great for this summer.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, I love how it leaves my skin silky soft but light enough for my feet without feeling gross.</li>
    <li> I had used this wonderful lightweight but effective lotion for several years but then could not find it for about five years. Glad it&#x27;s on Amazon. It&#x27;s so smooth and non-greasy, without fragrance other than something natural and mild.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Purchased it after using the one from my hotel room.</li>
    <li> very light  lotion, light smell</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Buy this for my son every year for Christmas.  He likes it very much.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells great and it goes on light, unlike a lot of the heavier creams. This is a very good quality lotion. And the price I get it here on Amazon is excellent!! I will continue buying it here!</li>
    <li> Love this product makes my skin soft n my skin looks nice not oily great results</li>
    <li> Being a man I don&#x27;t like things that smell to frilly. This Neutragena lotion has an odor that is nice but not girlish or dainty.</li>
    <li> I first used this product in a hotel room as a sample. I loved it right away . I also tried the Neutrogena clean normalizing shampoo but have not been as lucky finding that product on line. The lotion is light &amp; soft and has a wonderful sent.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion--smells great and feels silky. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Light yet gets the job done</li>
    <li> Great item shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I originally discovered this lotion while staying at the Hilton in Kitty Hawk, NC.  (Samples in bathroom)  After leaving I had to find it and discovered it was not easy to locate in stores.  Found it on Amazon and love it.  My first reaction when I smelled it was it reminded me of my favorite scent from Yankee-Sun and Sand.  Great product and will order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> We love this lotion and the price we paid was much less than a store!</li>
    <li> Awesome body lotion!!!!  I would have given this product 5 Stars should the pump dispenser worked (More on that below).  The body lotion is lightly sesame scented, the lotion dissipates on skin quickly and your skin is soft and moisturized.  I love this lotion!!  I do not see many reviews with faulty dispenser bottles, so maybe they changed the pump design recently or I just really have bad luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flawed dispenser pump:  I purchased the Neutrogena Body Lotion Light Sesame Formula, 32oz Bottle from Amazon approx 5 months ago.  Upon arrival of the first bottle, I found that the dispenser pump would not work.  It was not cracked or damaged, the pump just didn&#x27;t work.  The pump could not draw the lotion up the tube because air released through the pump assembly.  Amazon handled the return quickly and shipped out the replacement, which I received the next day.  I&#x27;ve used this lotion daily for 5 months, and then one day dispenser pump just stopped working (with 80% more lotion still left in the bottle?)  It was the exact same issue as the first bottle received.  If you squeeze the bottle you can hear air rushing through the pump assembly.  With this air release, the pump has no pressure.  If you can find the same product but different packaging do not hesitate to buy.  Or have a backup lotion dispenser to transfer the product into?</li>
    <li> Silky and smells so fresh...I love smelling myself.  HAHA</li>
    <li> I found this lotion at the Hampton Inn when I stayed there and immediately searched online for it.  Amazon had this huge bottle at a really reasonable price.  The lotion is light enough to use as a facial moisturizer under makeup, yet heavy duty enough to get rid of my dry, cracked elbow patches!  I will be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion. The pump handle dispenser is non functional, so it&#x27;s nothing short of difficult to squeeze the lotion out of the bottle into another container which I then use a popsicle stick to ladle into a smaller container that I can actually use. It&#x27;s a bittersweet purchase due to the non functioning pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> Most moisturizers are too heavy or greasy for my skin.  This is light, but really smooths skin.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  The only problem was that pump came broken.  It just makes it difficult to&lt;br /&gt;dispense the cream.  Would still order it again.  Very hard to find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body lotion, but it is very hard to come by in the UK. It has a very light texture and the smell is lovely, plus it&#x27;s perfect for very sensitive skin like mine.  This bottle is amazing value as it came to GBP 19.19 including tax and shipping to London, but if I were to buy it here it would cost more than that for a quarter sized bottle! I placed my order on the 24th of December and was given an estimated delivery for the 12th of January. Instead, i received shipping confirmation on the 26th and the package arrived 4 days later, two weeks early! Can not recommend this product or service more, will definitely be buying here again!</li>
    <li> Best light weight lotion with a punch.  I use it for my mildly dry skin and also my kiddos.  The mild pleasant scent is great and the subrscription price here on amazon cant be beat!</li>
    <li> What I wanted and expected. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion and has a light fragrance which is perfect for me. While on vacation on the coast of California the hotel we were in had this in the room. When I got home I went online and found it and I have been wearing it ever since . The only downside is that every time I wash my hands I have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Great price for my all-time favorite body lotion. Have been using it for well over 15 yrs, and it&#x27;s been my favorite all that time. Leaves my skin feeling moist, but NEVER greasy...and, it soaks in quickly and completely.  (Please consider offering this item in the Amazon Subscribe and Save Program.)</li>
    <li> love it, really great on shin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for the winter. It is a light lotion so if you have very dry skin it may not be the lotion for you. I love the light scent and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> Best body lotion ever!  It goes on silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, easy to apply, great for the skin.  will definitely be a repeat item for me</li>
    <li> smells great , Silky to your skin!</li>
    <li> I had used this lotion when staying at a hotel that uses Neutrogena products as amenities and I fell in love with it.  I was delighted to find out that I could buy my own instead of hoarding little bottles from the hotel.  It is a light non oily or greasy lotion with a delicate scent that smells like you just stepped out of the shower.  Love it</li>
    <li> Loved the fragrance in the small sample you get in hotel room. Amazon was the only place I could find it. Very light and silky feeling!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent but not perfect for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Neutrogena body lotion forever. After my local store stopped carrying the 32ounce I started using other products and just wasn&#x27;t ever satisfied. This formula is so light, non greasy and soaks into your skin immediately. The smell is light and wonderful. I was recently using some Costco lotion and it was heavy and since I went back to this I am a happy happy happy girl again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and it glides on the skin like butter - it is so smooth! It dries quickly and leaves the skin very soft and plump.The scent is clean and soft, the sound of the flavor intended is true. Very unexpected, but i am glad i found this. Going to repurchase once i use up this huge bottle.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase the Sesame seed light oil, this is my first purcahse of the body lotion and it is perfect !!!</li>
    <li> This body lotion does not leave that greasy feeling after your shower it&#x27;s perfect for keeping your skin in better condition been using it for over 20+ years would recommend it to most all men who don&#x27;t like the smelly greasy oily and sticky feeling lotion after song forgot to three minutes after shower no odor would recommend it to all friends and family.</li>
    <li> absorb pretty good. keeps my skin moist</li>
    <li> Wonderfully smooth lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling greasy.  No perfume smell either.</li>
    <li> This light body lotion had a very warm floral scent that is very appealing. It does however quickly dissipate. I found this lotion to be moisturizing enough for dry summer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> My favorite body lotion!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and in good condition.  The user lives in Colorado where the air is dry and especially dry in the winter.  Light oil so that it seeps into your skin without leaving a huge amount laying onto of your skin into your clothes.</li>
    <li> This is a great light skin moisturizer with very subtle and discreet scent that will keep the skin hydrated and smooth throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. I have used it for years. It is light and smells fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work for me. It&#x27;s too light and doesn&#x27;t heel the dry skin at all .. waste my money !!! I like Sesame oil product but not this one !!!</li>
