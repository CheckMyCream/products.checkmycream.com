<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very Cheap mascara. I would not order again. The fibers fall all over your face and eyes.</li>
    <li> weren&#x27;t that many fibers in the fiber one. but very good overall</li>
    <li> Very dramatic, so I seldom wear it, but it bears out the hype.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the case like it said it would but they pretty much &amp;#34;made up for it&amp;#34; by sending 2 sets! Which is pretty cool but I did want the case. &amp; also my instructions came in English! I have yet to try it though!</li>
    <li> This product really is as I expected.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the redo order</li>
    <li> Worked just fine. Better than I thought!</li>
    <li> Lumpy and the fibers were dry and wouldn&#x27;t stick- must have been old</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t wanna pay full price for the &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34; brand as we all probably did. I wasn&#x27;t sure what the fibers were suppose to be or look like but I looked up a pic from the other brand and they looked exactly the same I used the fibers and mascara on one eye and just plain mascara on the other I could honestly see a big difference they were much longer so I am definitely impressed believe the hype! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the fibers in general not pritically this brand but for all of them is they fall from the brush in and around my eye I don&#x27;t like that at all so I suggest you do your eyes first or put something under your eyes other than that I love it it came in a leopard case very nice and you can&#x27;t beat 5 bucks will buy again</li>
    <li> Works great.. lashes are long... only problem is a small amount of fiber will fall on your face.. but other wise fine</li>
    <li> Love it it actually comes with the case but mine came damaged(the case) but its all good</li>
    <li> Comparable to younique at a much more affordable price. If you like younique you will like this as well. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because I can&#x27;t use it due to eye irritation from the fibers. Other than that it is a better value!</li>
    <li> good product, no scam</li>
    <li> At first it was good and i was very excited but then it ran out of transplanting gel after 4 days and i was so mad but it really did made my eyelashes longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I bough 4 tube one set for me and one for my mom best mascara ever goid price,good cuality , it has alot of fiber , tip wash a few vid. On what to do and not to do and belive me u will get good result&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
    <li> The fibers shedded a lot. And fell into my eyes each time I put it on Even after puting the Gel on. I will not be purchasing the product again.</li>
    <li> Okay first off it doesn&#x27;t come with case as pictured. Instructions are in chinese but I knew how to us fiber lash masscarra so it didn&#x27;t really bother me. The masscarra is really great honestly almost as good the 30$ high end one Ive tired but after one use of this masscarra it gave me a stye,so I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product and it was totally a waste of money.</li>
    <li> You cant beat this mascara for the price. Its simple to use and really makes my eyelashes ALOT longer.</li>
    <li> did not apply easily, the fibers fell in my eye.</li>
    <li> I will just leave this blank.</li>
    <li> I love this!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful alternative to false lashes. I don&#x27;t feel them on at all. Super lightweight! None of the fibers have fallen off. They give me long dramatic lashes on the top and bottom. They&#x27;re not as &amp;#34;Hollywood Glam&amp;#34; as falsies but these are great for day to day wear because they look very natural. I wouldn&#x27;t swim in them unless you put a top coat of waterproof mascara on after the gel has completely dried.</li>
    <li> Had to wait along time &amp; part of set was dried up.  Tried to contact seller.</li>
    <li> this actually works. i love how long and natural it makes my lashes look. minus 1 star for shipping though. it took forever and a day to be delivered</li>
    <li> Much better and easier to apply than  false eyelashes.  If you want the look of false eyelashes without having to spend the time and energy it takes to apply false eyelashes (not to mention if you want to get away from the messy and sometimes irritating glue you have to use to affix false lashes) then this is for you.  My first experience with fiber lashes was with the Younique brand.  I liked that brand, but it was exorbitantly expensive.  I thought I&#x27;d give the less expensive brand a try.  It is every bit as good.  However, you have to take a little more time when applying the Love Alpha.  I found that I needed to apply the product two or three times to get the dramatic effect for which I was looking - - that of long long lashes.  I notices that there isn&#x27;t as heavy a concentration of fibers on Love&#x27;s wands (thus the reason you need to apply several times).  That could be a good thing though.  With the Younique brand it seems like you get too much fiber which causes your lashes to look clumpy and gross.  The Younique directions even tell  you that you might need to brush your lashes with a lash brush to remove clumps.  All in all I like the Love Alpha brand.  I actually purchased more because I like it so much.</li>
    <li> There are some other brands out there of this same sort of product, for $60+ This works just as well, and for a 1/4 pf the price! (the case and everything are very good quality too!</li>
    <li> This product was a complete joke. It arrived yesterday and I threw it away today. Product was sooooooo dry. Tried again and again but it just was a big disappointment. It did nothing for my lashes, oh wait it did....it made them look shorter due to the dry clumpy formula. I literally laughed out loud as I threw it away. May work for some but for the same price i can get a decent mascara that will actually do some of what it claims.</li>
    <li> I returned this product. The fibers did not stick to the primer and got in my eyes. Also, it looked clumpy.</li>
    <li> it was a gift and it didnt come in the cute package as shown in the picture.  I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews on much of anything but I have to on this product!!! All I can say is holy mother of lashes this stuff is amazing. I was skeptical to buy after reading mixed reviews but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try. Everyone notices the difference... I have put up to 5 layers so far just to see where this stuff could take my lashes and they literally touched my eyebrows and were still not clumpy... Obviously that would not be an everyday look but it was just for fun.... I am truly impressed with this product!! I do use the clinique lash primer under this and I also use the clinique high impact extreme mascara in extreme black over it and it still doesn&#x27;t clump. This will forever be a staple in my every day makeup routine... And as a makeup artist that is a big deal! And you can&#x27;t beat this price!!! Genuinely amazed and satisfied!!!!! Stop reading reviews and buy it now!! And no .. I don&#x27;t work for this company and this is a real review not a fake since everyone on amazon seems to think that all positive reviews are fake... :)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I do get a few fibers on my cheeks when I apply, but they just brush right off. I haven&#x27;t worn falsies since buying this!</li>
    <li> I thought this product did not do a good job. It was very messy. You can tell this product is very cheap. Recently, I had someone from this company called Younique let me try there fiber lashes. At first, I was not going to try it since I did Love Alpha and the results were terribly. The consultant told me it was completely different than Love Alpha and I should try Younique because every company is different. I said okay and tried it and loved it on the spot. My friend also liked it when she tried it and was also loving it. It was 29.00, but the product was really worth it. Support the presenter because she is awesome and really will take care of you. She provided me tips and tricks to get even better results.[...]</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara. And it lasts a couple days if you don&#x27;t wash it off. Made my lashes about 3 times longer. In love... and a great price compared to $40 I would have spent on others. And if it&#x27;s raining you can apply waterproof mascara over it once it dries and works great</li>
    <li> no real difference, i get better results with my regular mascara and also I put it on the morning and couple later I ended up having fibers all over my face. Not recommended at all!</li>
    <li> this product is junk i get better results with my regular mascara and also it is very messy you end up having fibers all over your face and you feel like you have something in your eyes constantly!!!</li>
    <li> Received set with EMPTY transplanting gel tube. Literially there was NOTHING IN IT. Emailed seller and they told me &amp;#34; THIS IS NOT EMPTY , THIS IS ONE JUST LIKE THIS , IT IS  concentrate&amp;#34; Well my co worker purchased the same one from the same seller and her tube had gel it in. So I know that mine was not correct.. I understand that things happen and I was not upset about it at first but when they tell me that ITS NOT EMPTY , when I am clearly holding it in my hand and there is nothing in it ,, Now they have an upset customer on their hands.. No courtesy, no empathy .. terrible way to do business.. Would give negative stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first. With just a few applications my lashes look awesome I get tons of compliments way better than using false lashes. I do recommend applying regular mascara after you get your final took to avoid fall out!!</li>
    <li> Didnt like it it made some eyelashes fall off nd made my eyes watery</li>
    <li> Tried these a few times and they are awful. The fibers all fall off within a few hours. The ony way I could see these lasting all day is if you reapply them multiple times a day. I&#x27;ll be sticking to regular mascara from now on.</li>
    <li> Lash fibers would fall into my eyes. Lashes rubbed off and leave black under my eyes. Considered a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the Transplanting Gel and it can almost be used for mascara. I also love the fibers...BUT.....these fibers come off all day long and are constantly getting in my eyes. I have even tried using the transplanting gel after I apply the fibers. My eyelashes are beautiful with this on them, I just expected more out of the product.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use, if not slightly time consuming. Delivers ridiculous length to lashes but does not boost volume that much. Instructions that come with product are completely in Chinese altho there is some English on the insert, it&#x27;s only the product name.  There are however plenty of YouTube tutorials for this and other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw best results when I used my normal mascara first to make sure lashes were seperated and allowed that to dry before applying the fiber lashes. There is also a bit of a learning curve: if you&#x27;re not careful it&#x27;s easy to end up with bits sticking at odd angles from the end of your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and if you want ultra long lashes, look no further. The only reason I did not give the product 5 stars is because I expected at least a little bit of extra volume from the product but it doesn&#x27;t add volume.</li>
    <li> I happy the product came in 2 weeks early than expected. The only problem is that I did not recieve the case that was suppose to come with it and I want my case!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> Not good as I thought. The fiber fall my face.</li>
    <li> this is a RIP OFF of another brand. do not be fooled, check what&#x27;s In it. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR</li>
    <li> Definitely can see a difference.  My lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> This product was awful... There was nothing in my containers</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. it took a while to get the hang of it. sometimes you have to give it more than a second try.</li>
    <li> I really like the fibers of the Love Alpha but the transplanting gel is clumpier than the product I used prior.  Still looks great though!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! My lashes are so long with it. And with age my previously long thick lashes aren&#x27;t what they used to be. And my eyes are sensitive but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! Even when I forget to take it off. Which by the way it will still be on and then washes off easily with soap and water. Of course since I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks I don&#x27;t know how long it will stay good and it takes a very long time to ship. So that may be some trial and error getting that down. But for what I paid for it I will be buying it over and over again!! My lashes look so good.</li>
    <li> I loved it, my lashes look longer and so did the person that I bought the other one for. I have 4 others that want to buy it now and I will be purchasing some more for my nieces for christmas, great deal!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in the past n I love it, I will buy more frim here when I need to, I would recommend buying from here</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and my lashes looked awesome. The main reason I don&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is that it is EXTREMELY drying to lashes. I went from awesome to awful. My Half of the length of my lashes just got super dry, brittle and broke off.  It took about 6 weeks of my putting vitamin E on nightly on my lashes to get them to grow back. You do get more fibers than gel. I ended up using the fibers with regular mascara and it looked pretty darned good! I&#x27;ll buy this only if I cannot find another brand that is not so drying and continue the vitamin E regimen.</li>
    <li> I know the reviews are mixed on this product. But personally i love it. The price is much more reasonable that the name brand stuff. I wore this to Phoenix comicon this year and it hit 110 degrees that weekend. I was worried that it would end up just sliding off my face, but it didn&#x27;t.  It stayed put. The key is you have to curl your lashes first, then put on one coat of your regular mascara, then do the transplanting gel, then fibers, then more gel to seal it. If you want them longer just add more fiber after you put on the gel and keep going till your happy with it. But remember to put the fibers on the gel while it&#x27;s still wet or they won&#x27;t stay and always seal it with the gel last.</li>
    <li> My lashes are very fine.  This product really brings them to life.  I would have given it 5 stars but, you have to brush your lashes after the last application or you will end up with black fibers under your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed with this mascara.  The &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; is very minimal in sticking so I don&#x27;t know that it really does anything.  i won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected.  Takes some getting used to.  Fibers can irritate eyes if gotten to close to base of eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I would buy this again i will. Never buy regular  mascara again if you have not try this mascara. Please do the best you can&#x27;t go wrong with thos product,</li>
    <li> Love this product it is as good as they say looks like I have false eyelashes on</li>
    <li> I love the product but was disappointed that it did not arrive in the case as pictured.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product I liked it and could tell a difference in the length, but it does not seem to be worth the trouble. Everytime I check the mirror there are more fibers stuck onto my eyelids up to my eyebrows/under eyes, just sticks to all my makeup,,, they just keep coming off throughout the day. I was hoping this would be a great product, because I did not want to pay for the more expensive, &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34;, so I will stick with my mascara for now</li>
    <li> This product has cute packaging but the instructions included are in Chinese. I am unable to read them and from the pictures included with the instructions has multiple steps.  I am new to fibre mascara, so I will need to YouTube to figure this out.</li>
    <li> Did not come with the case.  Don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping this would help lenghthen my short eyelashes! It did!! But the tube of fiber lashes was almost completley empty!!! I got to use it 3 times! I&#x27;m very disappointed it was like someone sent me their empty tube!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in a case. And the fiber seems to be dried out</li>
    <li> Average mascara, messy when removing.  Goes on easy but not much different than a new tube of mascara.  Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product and I really like it! It lengthens and darkens my lashes better than my regular mascara. I recommend this product if you want to darken, and extend your lash length.It comes it a really nice case to protect the actual mascara tubes, they are metal and will get scratched if you just carry them in your purse. Unfortunately, the directions don&#x27;t come in english, so you will need to watch YouTube videos for application instructions. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Terrible and fibers fly into my eyes all day  long and make my eyes water and itch. Terrible imposter of younique fiber lashes.</li>
    <li> Dont let the price keep u from ordering this. I have almost non existent lashes, very short and very light in color. This makes them look super long and thick. I was thrown aback by the price but then decided that $5.85 for mascara wasnt that bad and am I h last I got it.  I will definitely order more and more of these. Ut washes iff or wipes of wuth soapy water so easily. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The product is about what I expected. It clumps a lot but then the instructions are not in English and maybe I am doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Be patient when applying</li>
    <li> The fiber pieces fell all over my face. Wouldn&#x27;t wear this out in public. I tried it on at the house just because I had read reviews of people having issues with the fibers. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go out with these. The regular mascara seemed dry and cachey when applied, perhaps that&#x27;s why the fibers weren&#x27;t sticking on to the lashes.</li>
    <li> My lashes are 3 times longer than they already were! My lashes are naturally very long, and this made them massive!</li>
    <li> There was literally nothing in the fiber container and it didn&#x27;t come with a case. Horrible</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it. Make sure you have some extra time to fool around with it, the stuff is wild! I suggest one eye at a time.</li>
    <li> Woow!!!! how can people wear this type of mascara? Those fiber are terrible when they get in your eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product but don&#x27;t expect the case with it because they won&#x27;t send it ! I&#x27;m kinda disappointed because I liked their case.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP which is pretty much what I expected for paying so little money for it. From the cheap plastic brushes to not being able to get the fibers out of the tube......this stuff is a NEGATIVE 5. Invest in the good stuff. YOUNIQUE may be expensive but WELL worth it. I will never purchase this stuff again!</li>
    <li> Very rare for me to apply makeup, but sometimes I want to have longer lashes...and this mascara easy to use and clean. 4 stars  because the fiber does fall to my eyes, had to very careful while applying the fiber. But the result is AMAZING !!!</li>
    <li> Love love love love, Love Alpha!! Work better than the too faced. Looks so natural!!!! You HAVE to set the final coat of fibers with the gel AND then a coat of regular mascara!! The fibers are black which I love, so u can see where they fall while you&#x27;re applying so it&#x27;s as simple as gently brushing them off your face to remove them. People make things more difficult then the need to be!! It&#x27;s not hard. This mascara is so easy to apply and get a great, long, natural look. And you won&#x27;t find any other fiber lash mascara for less $$!!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle if you have really thin lashes - Not as good as fakies!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price and the shipping was super fast!!!</li>
    <li> I knew when buying this not to get my hopes up because it&#x27;s a cheap China product which usually is not the best, but I LOVE this! It works great. It makes my eyelashes look false! I highly recommend this if you don&#x27;t want to buy the expensive younique brand because this one works just as good!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!  The product comes with NON ENGLISH instructions.  So you can U-TUBE the directions.  But, its super easy to apply and works like MAGIC.  Bought 2 more...  and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll even be back for more!  Just dont expect for the item to arrive right away like most amazon ordered products.  This item takes abour 25 days.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the case like in the picture.</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail yesterday and am using it for the first time today.  After 3 years, I stopped wearing false eyelashes and my own eyelashes have truly suffered.  It has been 2 weeks since I have worn them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  It has made my skimpy eyelashes look really long.  I can truly notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Be careful when you put it  on, because it will get in yours eyes and it is annoying.  This is the only reason I am giving it a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its mascara, so I can&#x27;t really say too much.  I bought it after doing a Youtube review.  I do recommend if you want to make your eyelashes noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have NO complaints about this product, and am actually about to re-order. I originally purchased it in July 2014. I find application very easy. It makes my eyelashes look AMAZING, and it&#x27;s much cheaper than similar products by other brands. The instructions aren&#x27;t in English, but I think that using the product is pretty self-explanatory, and if it isn&#x27;t, try Youtube. I see reviews complaining that the product did not come with the hard case pictured, but mine did. I also haven&#x27;t had any issues with the fibers flaking off during the day, BUT I do sometimes layer waterproof mascara over this product just in case.</li>
    <li> It works. It looks great. I love it! The trick is...apply the mascara gel on one entire lash starting at the lid, and apply the fibers on the tips...you don&#x27;t have to take it to the lids.  It is not messy if used correctly.  Once you complete one eye, start on the other.  It&#x27;s an awesome product.  I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts and my friends are hooked.</li>
    <li> They definetly added length, but fall off through out the day and get in your eyes. I suggest using a coat of clear mascara over the top to keep them in place.</li>
    <li> this is not as great as younique but i like it. i can wear it as my everyday mascara. it just requires more applications to achieve the look unlike younique.</li>
    <li> This does work well, and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Aside from the forever wait for the package it did not give me beautifully long lashes.  Also, tiny fibers continually feel on my cheeks and got into my eyes making them red and itchy.</li>
    <li> This is the best cosmetic purchase I have ever made!  My lashes are substantially fuller and longer than with regular mascara!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing. I would recommend it. All she would</li>
    <li> Love the casing that it comes in (so cute). It really works a lot better than I had imagined, for such a cheap price. I used Younique not that long ago, and have to say that this is pretty comparable, and I don&#x27;t have to feel bad about using it that often because it&#x27;s not as pricy!</li>
    <li> very happy with this product the only thing is it took way to long to get it. other than that it works great</li>
    <li> Wonderful look but sometimes the fibers gets into my eyes and can make my eyes red and be very irritating</li>
    <li> Amazing price for a really good lengthening and volumizing mascara! I have used many fiber extension mascaras including Too Faced and the new Physicians Formula one - and this one works really well - much better than the New Physicians Formula one (I don&#x27;t think it does what it claims and the fibers don&#x27;t really help much)! For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat! I am obsessed with lengthening mascaras and have had professional lash extensions, and this mascara is a great one. I will definitely purchase again and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I can NOT live without this mascara! I am a mascara junkie and this one takes the cake. My lashes are long and lucious, and it amazes me everytime I use it! I love you, Love Alpha!!! Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this! Xoxo</li>
    <li> I like this price waaaay more than the 30+ dollars for Younique! Application takes some practice, but you&#x27;ll be amazed at how long your lashes will look! Until you master the application, you will have fiber fall-out on your cheeks, but once you get the technique down, that stops.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m angry I bought this on ebay for $11.99. I should&#x27;ve researched it better. Now let me tell you this is the best thing I have ever used ! No joke ! I have an array of mascaras and make up in general.  This is truly amazing stuff. I put it on and went to bed I mean I slept the whole night and it didn&#x27;t budge ! Took a shower today and  it came off with soap and water. You can throw away all your other mascaras you will never need them again. I am up there in age and trust me I&#x27;ve tried them all this is by far the best mascara you will ever use. And at this price? Stock up !</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS BOMB!&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely skeptical when adding this to my cart as it is so inexpensive. I have a friend who uses Younique and I really wanted to try it, but it is just so expensive. I was so excited/nervous to try this when I received it in the mail. I was not disappointed! It works wonders! I asked my boyfriend how my lashes looked and after looking at them he said, &amp;#34;You have fake lashes on, don&#x27;t you?!&amp;#34; NOPE! Just this awesome Fiber Lash Mascara for a GREAT price.  Seriously awesome. I put a layer of my own mascara on first, making sure my eyelashes aren&#x27;t clumping. Then a layer of transplanting gel, and IMMEDIATELY after the fibers and then another layer of the transplanting gel. I like to put another layer of fibers on to make my lashes a little longer, but that is up to your personal preference!</li>
    <li> Delivery lengthy, but arrived as promised...I like the product.  Only criticism is that there are no English directions included with the product.</li>
    <li> My sister got pink eye from this mascara.</li>
    <li> DRIED OUT WITH IN 2WEEKS</li>
    <li> Came in more quickly than I expected, not crazy about the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> it was good but loreal one are the best.I add it to my monthly shipping list!</li>
    <li> Disappointed... Was delivered without the case...actual fiber lashes.. Not impressed with first use but will apply again and see if it works better. Good for price.</li>
    <li> The product took a while to get here but it&#x27;s not as good as younique&#x27;s 3d fiber lash. The fibers are actually a little dry &amp; when you apply, try not to apply tons of coats one after another, it&#x27;ll cause irritation. Aside from that, it works the way it should.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I love this product! I use the Younique 3D Lashes and I prefer the Love Alpha 3D Lashes. Younique 3D Lashes make my lashes long, but they clump together really bad. The Love Alpha make my lashes long and thick with ZERO CLUMPING! I was really impressed and shocked! I thought that since the price was so low that the product was going to be awful, I was wrong...happily wrong. There are a few differences between Younique and Love Alpha, but I personally do not think that the differences are big.&lt;br /&gt;The wands:&lt;br /&gt;Younique&#x27;s wands are thicker and big.&lt;br /&gt;Love Alpha wands are a bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;The products:&lt;br /&gt;Younique&#x27;s gel is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Love Alpha&#x27;s gel is thin but keeps lashes from clumping.&lt;br /&gt;To me, the fibers are exactly the same. I had better results with the Love Alpha and I will order more! As far as shipping goes, it shipped right away and took about three or four weeks to reach Michigan, I am patient and I will wait for a great price! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this , when i received it , it was broken , doesnt even work , i asked for a refund or a new one they never got back to after i sent so many emails out ! never again will I buy this product !</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible mascara ran out of fibers after one use.  Not worth buying the cheap stuff spend the extra money and get younique!</li>
    <li> I dont give reviews on anything, but i just recieved these today and its the best thing a girl can buy for her lashes. So much cheaper than the prices i have been seeing, but just as good. I recommend this product! Made my lashes seem SO much longer. DEFINITELY will be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I rarely use this stuff i ended up paying 20$ for it awhile ago .it would be awesome stuff if it didnt shed onto my cheeks and in my eyes during the day!</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I was hoping it came with the case.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I will never us false eyelashes again. This makes my eyelashes look false! Long and luscious. Best part is my sensitive eyes are never irritated by this at all!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This mascara smells and made my eye swell up. It is not natural or hypoallergenic like stated. It took over a month and a half to be delivered. I&#x27;d save your money and get the real deal. [...] I will spend 29$ and have it in a week than wait a month for something that got my eye all messed up. I was not a happy customer</li>
    <li> horrible product. the fibers get ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!</li>
    <li> The product is great, love the look of my longer lashes and at a very reasonable price (compared to other fiber mascaras).  I rated 3 stars because the CASE IS NOT INCLUDED, I have attached a photo of how the product comes out of the mailer. I ordered this particular Item because it appeared as if the case was included, the word case actually appearing in the title. I may have misunderstood but I also feel the product description was misleading. Also be aware the order took almost a month to receive in the states from China. The instructions are in Chinese but there are application instructions on the Amazon listing for reference. This mascara is amazing, however I wish the leopard case had been included.</li>
    <li> It tends to flake off a lot but it does lengthen them. I don&#x27;t use it due to the amount of flaking.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t anything bad to say about it, except the whole instructions in Chinese thing... Thankfully I have been wanting something like this for about a year and I already knew how to apply it!&lt;br /&gt;If you wear fake lashes... STOP NOW and buy this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!!</li>
