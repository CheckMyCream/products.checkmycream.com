      <li>Very happy with this Bath bomb!</li>
      <li>It smell so very good.  </li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>it smells so good</li>
      <li>these aren&#x27;t as good.  </li>
      <li>Loved the fragrance.</li>
      <li>All of their fragrances are great :)</li>
      <li>They are very cheap!</li>
      <li>i absolutely love this bath bomb!</li>
      <li>I liked it though.</li>
      <li>I love both smells on their own, but</li>
      <li>these are great bath balls bit large</li>
      <li>Smelled okay, I guess.</li>
      <li>These bath bombs start out with a fun fizziness as they dissolve and then they create a sort of bubble bath (maybe more of a foam bath) that smells great and makes your skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>There are many scent options.  </li>
      <li>its my favorite.</li>
      <li>If you want a cute bath experience and have silky smooth skin afterwards I encourage these!</li>
      <li>The fragrances are just okay.</li>
      <li>It had a gentle scent that was pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
      <li>I love the HN bath bombs, but this one has a REALLY strong smell.</li>
      <li>Great scent and fizzing action.</li>
      <li>They are HUGE and can easily be used for 2 baths, not just one.</li>
      <li>Dissolved completely and was a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>They smell great, leave my skin feeling super soft and don&#x27;t leave a residue in the tub.</li>
      <li>Arrived promptly and damage free.</li>
      <li>I love bath bombs, and these are nice large ones for reasonable price.</li>
      <li>What was really great about this bath bomb was how long it lasted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like a bit more scent, otherwise high marks.</li>
      <li>just would like them to fizz more and desolve completely.</li>
      <li>The price and smell was nice, but this thing took forever to fizz out, next time</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s because it is more condense than the LUSH brand.</li>
      <li>it helps my dry skin nice smell</li>
      <li>It seemed to take about a half hour to completely dissolve into the bath, great scents.</li>
      <li>It also caused a light foam to form from where it fizzed on the surface, and the water turned a very very light bluish green, but it did not stain my bath tub at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just as I expected and more.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing, makes for a soothing bath</li>
      <li>i sometimes forget the time and stay on the tub much longer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several bath bombs &amp; these by far are my favorite.</li>
      <li>Decent smell.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fizz like a LUSH bath bomb but don&#x27;t be fooled by that!</li>
      <li>Not only is it quite large-around a tennis ball or so, but it fizzed the whole time i was in the bath, I eventually turned into a prune and got out, and took the gumball sized remainder out with me to use in a foot soak.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for intense color, go to LUSH, but I never liked too much color because it stains tubs.</li>

<li> However, they barely fizz at all and do not dissolve completely in the bath, even after half an hour.&lt;br</li>
<li> Compared to  other bath bombs such as those made by Lush</li>
<li> Did not leave behind a significant residue, was not overpowering of a scent, and did not foam up excessively.</li>
<li> did notice that fizzing was more violent if it was closer to the surface, so if you have a really deep bath, you might want to hold it up closer to the surface for a while.&lt;br</li>
<li> Be prepared for the bath to last at least 45 minutes so this bath bomb can dissolve.</li>
<li> so I take it out when dissolved about half way</li>
<li> About half dissolved.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll cut it in half</li>
<li> Perhaps I just got one that had very little scent, but if you have issues with stronger smells giving you headaches, this could be a winner.</li>
<li> These things are heavy!</li>
<li> not sure I&#x27;m into this combination.</li>
<li> Not amazing.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a slow fizz</li>

    <li> Arrived promptly and damage free. No fizz. Sunk to bottom of tub. About half dissolved. Decent smell.</li>
    <li> Great scent and fizzing action. Dissolved completely and was a pleasant smell. Did not leave behind a significant residue, was not overpowering of a scent, and did not foam up excessively.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are awesome! They are HUGE and can easily be used for 2 baths, not just one. They smell great, leave my skin feeling super soft and don&#x27;t leave a residue in the tub. I&#x27;ve tried several bath bombs &amp; these by far are my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love bath bombs, and these are nice large ones for reasonable price. However, they barely fizz at all and do not dissolve completely in the bath, even after half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;They are moisturizing and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;I just would like them to fizz more and desolve completely.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fizz like a LUSH bath bomb but don&#x27;t be fooled by that! It&#x27;s a slow fizz but I think it&#x27;s because it is more condense than the LUSH brand.

    <li> Compared to  other bath bombs such as those made by Lush these aren&#x27;t as good.  The fragrances are just okay.</li>
    <li> When I got it. It broke and didn&#x27;t fizz the tub too well. I liked it though. Inexpensive and relaxing</li>
    <li> The price and smell was nice, but this thing took forever to fizz out, next time I&#x27;ll cut it in half</li>
    <li> These things are heavy! Be prepared for the bath to last at least 45 minutes so this bath bomb can dissolve. Smells great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this bath bomb! its my favorite. it smells so good i sometimes forget the time and stay on the tub much longer.</li>
    <li> It seemed to take about a half hour to completely dissolve into the bath, great scents. Very relaxing, makes for a soothing bath</li>
    <li> Great! Loved the fragrance. Very happy with this Bath bomb!</li>
    <li> This bath bomb was very solid and dense. It had a gentle scent that was pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong. Perhaps I just got one that had very little scent, but if you have issues with stronger smells giving you headaches, this could be a winner. What was really great about this bath bomb was how long it lasted. Not only is it quite large-around a tennis ball or so, but it fizzed the whole time i was in the bath, I eventually turned into a prune and got out, and took the gumball sized remainder out with me to use in a foot soak. It also caused a light foam to form from where it fizzed on the surface, and the water turned a very very light bluish green, but it did not stain my bath tub at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that fizzing was more violent if it was closer to the surface, so if you have a really deep bath, you might want to hold it up closer to the surface for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change would be I&#x27;d like a bit more scent, otherwise high marks.</li>
    <li> these are great bath balls bit large so I take it out when dissolved about half way it helps my dry skin nice smell</li>
    <li> Not as fizzy as I&#x27;d wanted it to be. And it sort of burned my skin. Smelled okay, I guess. Not amazing. Just alright.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs start out with a fun fizziness as they dissolve and then they create a sort of bubble bath (maybe more of a foam bath) that smells great and makes your skin feel silky smooth.  There are many scent options.  I prefer the Sea Fennel and Passionflower scent.  I found the lavender and chamomile to be too perfumy for me.</li>
    <li> I love the HN bath bombs, but this one has a REALLY strong smell. I love both smells on their own, but not sure I&#x27;m into this combination.</li>
    <li> the smell just makes you want to take a bath the minute you get it.  It smell so very good.  Just as I expected and more.</li>
