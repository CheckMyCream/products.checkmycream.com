      <li>I LOVE these combs!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I found them!</li>
      <li>Stay cool and look great in seconds.</li>
      <li>Good quality, and holds my fine hair well.  </li>
      <li>Keeps hair off your neck which is especially important in  hot weather.  </li>
      <li>I start from the nape of my neck, bring them up horizontally until they are at the top of my head, then bring them together.  </li>
      <li>Even then a person had to hunt for the correct brand because most of the products would slip out of the hair.  </li>
      <li>Love these...great for travel and for those windy days.  </li>
      <li>I love this interlocking comb.</li>
      <li>Love them, but too pricey.</li>
      <li>It sure holds your hair up</li>
      <li>and I get so many complements.</li>
      <li>I will say this, Goody used to market these combs in WalMart not so many years ago with a price of about one-third.  </li>
      <li>Love mine</li>
      <li>I just wish they made them in more colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on them.</li>
      <li>These combs are perfect for holding back longish hair cut in a shag but longish on the sides.</li>
      <li>Had so many people ask about it.</li>
      <li>Will buy more as needed.</li>
      <li>but so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and I always get compliments on my hair and people asking &amp;#34;WOW how do you do that?&amp;#34; Simple and easy best tool ever...</li>
      <li>By Nisia :  I&#x27;m perfectly happy with my new combs.</li>
      <li>They need to be filed more smoothly.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good Seller.</li>
      <li>My Wife Loved it so much</li>
      <li>Flexible and strong.</li>
      <li>The leggings fit</li>
      <li>This is so comfortable and keeps my hair up with some style.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>These are far superior.</li>
      <li>They were popular in the 70s but unavailable where I live now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this type of clamps for 20 years and I will say this company has really produced a top quality product.</li>
      <li>I have ordered them 3 times and they fit tight which is good for fine hair.</li>
      <li>The search was well worth it.  </li>
      <li>The product it self is nice but definitely does not hold my hair in any shape or fashion.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m wearing them right now..</li>
      <li>and the order came right to me with no delay whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>Looks really nice with long hair</li>
      <li>These are wonderfully large and can hold a LOT of hair!</li>
      <li>The higher price is more than worth it as I purchased several of the cheaper versions from a competitor (on Amazon) as well.</li>
      <li>These combs by France Luxe are much more flexible - reminiscent of the Goody brand.  </li>
      <li>So glad this tortoiseshell color came back into stock.  </li>
      <li>The comb set is exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
      <li>Very please with the company, my order arrived in 2 days!</li>
      <li>but I would not buy another set whereas the smaller banana combs are a better size.  </li>
      <li>I will be order more in the future</li>
      <li>These combs really make hair dressing fun.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they are not available easily any more.  </li>
      <li>Combs are very nice and are flexible--not like the hard plastic combs.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago these were sold in stores at a much cheaper price, (brand name probably different).  </li>
      <li>, I wanted these for for a long time, gave mine away years ago, glad I found them.</li>
      <li>well however the arrived with a large hole in the crotch.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ecstatic over my France Luxe Large Interlocking Comb Pair.  </li>
      <li>A little larger than most,  I plan on getting more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 packages of 2, of those cheap styles, and within days, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; break because they are very brittle and have no give when trying to lock the combs into place (my friends say the same).  </li>
      <li>I was very nervous about ordering on line</li>
      <li>The combs worked really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>They hold my hair up really well.</li>
      <li>I thought the largeness of the clip would be great for a french twist but its hard work getting the result as theye never iterlock and if you get them too it is at an X shape....</li>
      <li>They are better quality than the ones previously carried by W/M</li>
      <li>I needed the older style plastic that bends instead of breaking.</li>
      <li>i now want more in multiple colors if thats possible.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive, but they&#x27;re worth it to me!  </li>
      <li>Since the combs don&#x27;t show under my hair, I also use a little crab clip at the very top, and on a hot day, an additional little comb at the very bottom to hold hair off my neck.</li>
      <li>Find this adds a little more style to hair than the old Banana clip.</li>
      <li>I usually wear both of them at one time - while they don&#x27;t interlock, you can get a pretty cool &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Until I checked the internet I have been unable to find any good combs and there are almost none around in the stores.  </li>
      <li>smaller than what I expected, I had a large one years ago and was hoping I had found it again, sadly not, still like it.</li>
      <li>Very simple to use and can be used for a cascading pulled back hairstyle, or a more reserved up-do (by holding hair in ponytail and folding it in half and then cinching it together with these</li>
      <li>The tortoise pattern is more a dark brown not much of a pattern.</li>
      <li>closed the wrong way in picture 2 only because I have curly hair and nobody will notice but also it allows me to tuck and keep all my hair in the comb better as well as it feeling better to ware.</li>
      <li>If your hair is not quite long enough to be completely contained at the back of your head, you can use other devices on the sides and top and bottom.</li>
      <li>I found cheap knock offs with hard plastic that wouldn&#x27;t hold together.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t end up with the old flat hair head dome look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can&#x27;t find these in any store or any other website.  The higher price is more than worth it as I purchased several of the cheaper versions from a competitor (on Amazon) as well. I had to buy a second set since I lost one of the combs.  These are the only ones that work in my extra thick hair!</li>
    <li> These are the best clips ever. I purchased one&lt;br /&gt;and am going to purchase another now.&lt;br /&gt;Came to my home in 6 days. I have thick&lt;br /&gt;hair and it all fits in the clips. Well&lt;br /&gt;worth the money. Also they are flexable&lt;br /&gt;not stif like those cheaper type !!</li>
    <li> These combs are perfect for holding back longish hair cut in a shag but longish on the sides. They were popular in the 70s but unavailable where I live now. The resulting \\&quot;pony tail\\&quot; cascades down the back of your head instead of bunching up in a single bun. If your hair is not quite long enough to be completely contained at the back of your head, you can use other devices on the sides and top and bottom. Since the combs don&#x27;t show under my hair, I also use a little crab clip at the very top, and on a hot day, an additional little comb at the very bottom to hold hair off my neck. I LOVE these combs!</li>
    <li> Hair looks amazing with these! Very simple to use and can be used for a cascading pulled back hairstyle, or a more reserved up-do (by holding hair in ponytail and folding it in half and then cinching it together with these combs).&lt;br /&gt;These combs are interlocking which means you must use both combs together, just press them together and they stay in place all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over a week now and they work great.  Do not pull your hair at all if put in with some slack.</li>
    <li> I use these combs as a pair to sweep my hair up into a cascading ponytail.  The only complaint I have is that the teeth do wear over time and it tends to loosen and not hold the hair as well.  I do wish that Goodie  would go back to making these and selling them in the stores like they did a few years ago.</li>
    <li> These combs are great in quality and color but somehow it just doesn&#x27;t lock together in my hair. So basically i can use only one at a time and even then it falls out from time to time. The product it self is nice but definitely does not hold my hair in any shape or fashion. It was a waste for me. Hopefully I can find someone who can put it too good use</li>
    <li> just  what  I  ordered,  came  on  time  in  mail,  very  satisfied</li>
    <li> These should be labled Jumbo! They are really big but they seem to work well. We shall see! I am giving as a gift.</li>
    <li> The combs worked really well. Just be careful when inserting them in your hair. The ends are very pointy and can be painful.</li>
    <li> smaller than what I expected, I had a large one years ago and was hoping I had found it again, sadly not, still like it.</li>
    <li> After reading others reviews I purchased this product. I&#x27;ve used this type of clamps for 20 years and I will say this company has really produced a top quality product. I&#x27;ve included pictures because for me I prefer to ware the clamp closed the wrong way in picture 2 only because I have curly hair and nobody will notice but also it allows me to tuck and keep all my hair in the comb better as well as it feeling better to ware. I have purchased two colors and will purchase more because they are wonderful to ware and I always get compliments on my hair and people asking &amp;#34;WOW how do you do that?&amp;#34; Simple and easy best tool ever... Thank You France Luxe!!!</li>
    <li> I love this interlocking comb. It sure holds your hair up and I get so many complements. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My Wife Loved it so much I bought Her an extra one ....</li>
    <li> I have been looking for 5 plus years for these combs and no one carries them.  I was very nervous about ordering on line but so glad I did.  I will be order more in the future</li>
    <li> Not same as previously purchased at Dept. Store, poor imitation.</li>
    <li> Good comb set. Too big for my head though. I could use one a little shorter.</li>
    <li> These combs really make hair dressing fun. You pull back all your curly hair and leave some locks in front of your ears. Stay cool and look great in seconds.</li>
    <li> These combs are impossible to find in stores.  They do a great job.  Just push your hair back and lock them in.  Keeps hair off your neck which is especially important in  hot weather.  They stay in place all day.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on them.</li>
    <li> I have both the short and long versions of these combs. Excellent quailty and do not gouge my scalp. Will buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> This is quality. No &#x27;cut&#x27; hair; wondeful hold. This is so comfortable and keeps my hair up with some style.&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Had so many people ask about it.</li>
    <li> Find this adds a little more style to hair than the old Banana clip. It lifts and swirls the hair away from the scalp so you don&#x27;t end up with the old flat hair head dome look.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the combs are too large.  I have been using them but I would not buy another set whereas the smaller banana combs are a better size.  I have been using the banana combs for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> These combs are great!  They are sturdy and hold thick hair well.  Looks really nice with long hair and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> So glad this tortoiseshell color came back into stock.  These are wonderful large combs that secure any type of hair perfectly.  The tips of the combs are a bit sharp but they can be softened with a few strokes of a nail file.  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ecstatic over my France Luxe Large Interlocking Comb Pair.  They are heavy duty and hold my thinning hair tight and secure without coming lose.  I had bought some about a year or so ago from another merchant on Amazon and they started breaking out teeth shortly after I got them.  They were less expensive AND, therefore, they were cheaply made.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive these were and debated spending the money.  But you cannot get these combs anymore and they are terrific.  I don&#x27;t understand why they are not available easily any more.  BTW I ordered them not even realizing they came in colors. The Tortoise was not available and there was going to be a delay on shipping.  I sent a message I did not care what color and the order came right to me with no delay whatsoever.  Thank you France Luxe I&#x27;ll never forget you!!!</li>
    <li> Love mine, I wanted these for for a long time, gave mine away years ago, glad I found them. Thanks</li>
    <li> The leggings fit well however the arrived with a large hole in the crotch.</li>
    <li> Love them, but too pricey.</li>
    <li> Good quality, and holds my fine hair well.  Just squeeze them together tightly.  I start from the nape of my neck, bring them up horizontally until they are at the top of my head, then bring them together.  The ends hang down pre-curled in a layered ponytail. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Combs are very nice and are flexible--not like the hard plastic combs.  But they are definitely made for someone with very thick hair.</li>
    <li> These arn&#x27;t by Goodie, but they are just as good.  I wore these combs back in the 90&#x27;s a lot and have looked for years for them and they were nowhere.  Kind of expensive, but they&#x27;re worth it to me!  They hold my hair up really well.</li>
    <li> This is 100% awesome.  This France Luxe product is semi-unbreakable as there appears to be some give in the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the comb.  I decided to pay extra for it, compared to the items sold on Amazon that look like the France Luxe, by persons who purchase them in bulk in China, and sell them on Amazon. I&#x27;ve had 2 packages of 2, of those cheap styles, and within days, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; break because they are very brittle and have no give when trying to lock the combs into place (my friends say the same).  Spend the extra on these, at least they will last longer than those cheap ones. I do remember the day (1990s) when nothing would cause the teeth of this style product to break, I wore them constantly.  Those were by Goody and like their other hair combing combs were &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34;. France Luxe are almost as good as those. Fast shipping and good Seller.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! i now want more in multiple colors if thats possible. but this is a for sure a awesome product i will be buying more!</li>
    <li> The search was well worth it.  Great quality if you know how to use them. Will buy more as needed.</li>
    <li> The comb set is exactly what I wanted and needed.  I will say this, Goody used to market these combs in WalMart not so many years ago with a price of about one-third.  But...since I needed these and WalMart wasn&#x27;t carrying them, Amazon rescued me and my requirement was met.  They are better quality than the ones previously carried by W/M so I suppose everything is a tradeoff.  I&#x27;m just glad I found them!</li>
    <li> how do you get this to hold your hair? It doesn&#x27;t click or clip its like you have to shove the combs together and even then it doesn&#x27;t stap put.I thought the largeness of the clip would be great for a french twist but its hard work getting the result as theye never iterlock and if you get them too it is at an X shape.... no good</li>
    <li> By Nisia :  I&#x27;m perfectly happy with my new combs. Just what I needed. The ones I&#x27;ve used before, did&#x27;nt work for me, not flexible enough. These I got today and I&#x27;m wearing them right now..I wish they came in other colors, I would get them all.</li>
    <li> The tortoise pattern is more a dark brown not much of a pattern. The molding also has sharp edges where the mold lines are. They need to be filed more smoothly. They lock together well. I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are one of the few combs that actually hold all of my thick long hair! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this hair comb! Keeps hair in place al day! A little larger than most,  I plan on getting more.</li>
    <li> Love these...great for travel and for those windy days.  I have ordered them 3 times and they fit tight which is good for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have LOTS of hair and these do the trick. Years ago I could find these wonderful combs and then they quit making them. I found cheap knock offs with hard plastic that wouldn&#x27;t hold together. These are far superior. Flexible and strong. I just wish they made them in more colors.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with size -- an inch too big.</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as I thought they would be. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last too long. I won&#x27;t order these again.</li>
    <li> Many years ago these were sold in stores at a much cheaper price, (brand name probably different).  Even then a person had to hunt for the correct brand because most of the products would slip out of the hair.  Until I checked the internet I have been unable to find any good combs and there are almost none around in the stores.  I am buying another one, this time I think I will settle on a smaller version.......just to see if it also has the same holding ability.  Very Pleased!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Goody used to have a line of these hair combs but they are no longer produced.  The ones I have found recently are so brittle they lose teeth the minute you lock them together.  These combs by France Luxe are much more flexible - reminiscent of the Goody brand.  They&#x27;re not cheap at $15 a pair, but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for! I needed the older style plastic that bends instead of breaking. I can even bend the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; back into place if they cross over.</li>
    <li> Combs too big for my hair they fall out cant use them</li>
    <li> These are wonderfully large and can hold a LOT of hair! I usually wear both of them at one time - while they don&#x27;t interlock, you can get a pretty cool &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; effect with them</li>
    <li> So glad I found these combs again! Goody used to carry these (in the 90&#x27;s) but have stopped.  These hold my curly hair without any slipping and creates a cascading look in the back.  Very comfortable!  Very please with the company, my order arrived in 2 days!</li>
