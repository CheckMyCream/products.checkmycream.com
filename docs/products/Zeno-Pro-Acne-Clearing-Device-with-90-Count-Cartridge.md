      <li>My face has never looked better.</li>
      <li>i would refer you to buy it because it is like a magic fairy pimople zapper.</li>
      <li>Thanks Zeno!!!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this item after reading a recommendation and was very excited to receive it.</li>
      <li>So, I got myself a Thermaclear instead, and at first I loved it:</li>
      <li>It is cute and effective, and worth every bit of the cost.</li>
      <li>I love that it is medication free and uses nothing more than heat.</li>
      <li>So, I was very encouraged to find out that there was a good alternative out there in the marketplace -- the Thermaclear device</li>
      <li>warm compresses with a warm towel (a nice steam facial), which has always done the trick for me.  </li>
      <li>I always use it right when I feel that soreness when you know a pimple is blooming!!</li>
      <li>What a cool, hip zit gadget!</li>
      <li>This week on Monday when I felt the developing pimple on my chin, I excitedly used the device as instructed over the course of 48 hours (cleaned the device, cleaned my face before application, and made sure not to scrub before or after).  </li>
      <li>It is really easy to use too.</li>
      <li>Just follow the instructions, which are really easy.</li>
      <li>I liked it when I first got it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice warm heat, which if used properly, leaves nothing more than a redness around the zit for about 30 mins.</li>
      <li>Just plug it in and it will be fine.   </li>
      <li>My mother tested it out on her arm but felt fine.  </li>
      <li>Zeno is a wonderful invention for people (young or mature) who have blemishes.  </li>
      <li>When I do break out, it is always huge zits that sometimes leave scars for months.  </li>
      <li>However after the minimum charge period a light appeared and the device began to work.</li>
      <li>Zeno seems like it&#x27;s best for people like me who get occasional pimples that screw up their week, not for a whole faceful of perpetual acne.</li>
      <li>It really does work wonders!!!  </li>
      <li>and it significantly improves the healing time.  </li>
      <li>My Dad had originally bought this for my sister and I both to use, as we have acne.  </li>
      <li>My clients love it because it works on most of their blemishes and because it contains no harsh, drying chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Good luck using Zeno without standing in a mirror and repositioning the tiny treatment plate every 2 seconds to make sure it is touching in the proper spot.</li>
      <li>It makes me feel good to know that I&#x27;m actually doing something, but also it really works!!</li>
      <li>Luckily I bought 2 and so,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other acne solutions and this seems to be the most effective.</li>
      <li>I also found it works even better on new zits.</li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s so fast and easy to zap the zits that this may have been the case.  </li>
      <li>The promise of clearing that 1 big stubborn zit overnight was so tempting, it was really too good to be true.    </li>
      <li>I was excited to use this device but cannot use it because it&#x27;s too hot for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re all busy with our everyday lives, and we try to be groomed and always look our best.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think it is worth almost $200.</li>
      <li>It is a safe, natural alternative for removing blemishes and I will continue to carry it in my spa.</li>
      <li>This is unlike any other rechargeable device I own, and it is in the literature but something as important as that should be highlighted.</li>
      <li>right, what can it do?</li>
      <li>I tested it out first on my arm and it was burning hot!</li>
      <li>I got the Zeno about 3 years ago from my dermatologist&#x27;s office, and saw good results: it cleared up or minimized existing blemishes within a couple of days, and it looked to me like it also prevented new blemishes from appearing, thus clearing the skin over the course of several months.  </li>
      <li>The zeno looks pretty, but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
      <li>well first off, you have to take it at the first sign of a pimple.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not so hot as to burn you.  </li>
      <li>As someone who sees a dermatologist, uses many different acne creams, potions, etc, I figured I had nothing to lose.  </li>
      <li>After settling on the Zeno Pro because of the reviews here and elsewhere, I was relieved to finally have a devise to make my skin blemish free!  </li>
      <li>I was concerned that the tip would be hot and burn her face - but, to my surprise, it does not irritate her skin at all.  </li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting too hot because it automatically turns off at the preset time.  </li>
      <li>Wonder if I could sell the tip, anyone interested?</li>
      <li>I should have purchased it in the regular store; I would have had better luck with it working like it said.  </li>
      <li>it is hot at first</li>
      <li>many which I have found to be unfounded now that I have used the Zeno personally.     </li>
      <li>I will admit it does get hot, but it does not hurt or burn at all.</li>
      <li>In any event, I decided to play it safe and returned the Thermaclear, and I reluctantly got myself to switch back to the Zeno -- yes, there&#x27;re definitely features that I do not like about the Zeno, but I must say after a Zeno treatment my skin feels fresh and \\&quot;clean from theinside\\&quot;, instead of irritated like with the Thermaclear.</li>
      <li>granted, it certainly looks bulky and unelegant compared to the sleek Zeno, but after all, it&#x27;s an acne device and not an iPhone, so looks</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
      <li>so for me it is very pricey and burns your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product actually works! I frequently get acne on my chin and this product prevents them from fully forming. I&#x27;ve tried other acne solutions and this seems to be the most effective.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all busy with our everyday lives, and we try to be groomed and always look our best. We each have problems areas, and mine used to be the skin on my face, but no longer. Sometimes the break outs are from stress, other times it&#x27;s hormones, but no matter the cause, maybe you feel like I do and have no time for break outs, especially before a big event, a date, or an important meeting. In addition to a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water, and having a good face washing routine, Zeno has me covered.&lt;br /&gt;I love my Zeno in teal. I bought it 3 years ago and it has served me well over the years. After the round element at the tip heats up, press it to the spot where you feel you are about to break out. Hold for a few moments and rejoice as the precise, focused heat destroys the bacteria hiding deep in the clogged pore. Remove Zeno and repeat the process on a different spot if needed. Relax as your body&#x27;s natural healing process kicks in and clears the offending clogged pore out and takes the debris away. If you are skeptical, don&#x27;t let it stop you from being adventurous and ordering one. I promise that you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I got this keeping my fingers crossed that it would work for me. I was pretty skeptical - I&#x27;m still really not sure why this thing is any different than a hot wet washcloth ?   Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t the solution I was hoping for, but I took advantage of the money back guarantee. I would tell someone that if they want to try it, go for it, but save the packaging just in case.</li>
    <li> This product was a dud for me. It didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m in my early 20s and this did nothing for me. You&#x27;re better off with a hot wet towel, which actually does work. It may work if the bump is just growing or the zit is in its early stages, but absolutely does not work once it&#x27;s developed and past. However, it didn&#x27;t work for me in the early zit stages either, it only managed to irritate it and make it a full blown problem that much quicker.</li>
    <li> I used the Zeno for the first time on two small developing pimples.  One of them was the kind that typically would turn into something bigger.  I used it twice in one day and at first I couldn&#x27;t tell if they looked the same or maybe even worse.  But I went to bed and when I woke up they were definitely better!  I can&#x27;t say for sure if Zeno prevented them from turning into bigger pimples, but at least it did not make them worse and I honestly think it worked.  I have been breaking out like crazy lately and this may have prevented another disaster.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I am 36 and have acne that doesnt respond to anything I have tried including this. I followed the instructions exactly and this did nothing for me. hope it works on somebody.</li>
    <li> This device actually works! I too was skeptical before using it, but it got rid of my pimple in just one treatment. I got up the next morning to do the second treatment and the pimple was gone. It is really easy to use too. It is cute and effective, and worth every bit of the cost. The Zeno also stays charged for quite a while. I would recommend this product to anyone no matter what your age. I use it, my teens use it, and I think I am going to try it on my husband next. Everyone needs a ZENO!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading a recommendation and was very excited to receive it. I charged it as per the instructions and noticed that there was no light to indicate that it was charging anywhere on the device. However after the minimum charge period a light appeared and the device began to work. I used it no more than 3-4 times before it completely died, never to be revived. I had registered the 1 year warranty with Tyrell Inc, so I tried to call them to find out what I needed to do to get a replacement. When I finally got hold of someone (which took quite a while), they took me through a spiel about unplugging to and plugging it back in the charge it again. This made no difference. I now wish to get a replacement as per the warranty guarantee but the company is proving very elusive. Having read other reviews on other sites written by people with exactly the same problem, I now realize that this is probably not a one-off issue. I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the product on acne, since I never had the chance to test it properly, but I can say that if you buy one be prepared to risk getting a dud device like I did.</li>
    <li> I love my Zeno.  It is used quite often.  I was surprised to see some low reviews.  After reading some I realized that everyone loves zeno, but thought they had some problems with the tip or batteries.  Since I am an \\&quot;experienced\\&quot; zeno user I think that they are not charging it regularly.  Its like a cell phone!!  Just plug it in and it will be fine.   I recommend this product to anyone that has mild or occasional breakouts.  It really does work wonders!!!  The majority of people will LOVE it!!  You can&#x27;t please everyone.</li>
    <li> I liked it when I first got it. Then in less than a year it just will not charge. I only used it a few times. Nothing happens, no lights, nothing blinks when I plug it in. I tried different outlets. Luckily I bought 2 and so, a year and a half later I opened the second one I had, brand new.I plugged it in and NOTHING happened, it will not charge, doesn&#x27;t work. I spent over $165, what a waste of money. It was not exposed to humidity, kept in a dry closet, constant temp. It is a gamble if it works and charges on, then it helps the acne. If it does not charge or turn on, then it is a just a pretty pink paper weight. Wonder if I could sell the tip, anyone interested?</li>
    <li> Any rechargeable product can NOT sit in a box a year uncharged and be expected to work. That is why it is a rechargeable product...the battery has to be charged regularly just like a digital or video camera. This is pretty basic. The directions on this product even tell you to keep it charged regularly.  Not smart to do otherwise. If you follow the directions, this is a good product that does what it claims. My face has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I used the Zeno morning and night for days, but failed to see any improvement in my pimples.  I then went back to my trusty old spot gel for acne, and now my skin is clearing.    I am mystified how they can claim that it heals pimples in a day.  There was some improvement, but no more than with any other acne treatment.  If you must have this gadget, I would recommend that you use it in addition to, rather than instead of, your usual treatments.</li>
    <li> Overall, Zeno has been an above-average success.  It is quite simple to use.  It dispenses concentrated heat to destroy bacteria.  I usually break out pretty badly every couple months.  When I do break out, it is always huge zits that sometimes leave scars for months.  I&#x27;m 33 and my acne has gotten worse as I age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed as I use it, it takes some zits that were bound to be pretty severe and prevents them from ballooning into massive acne.  It does not work on every zit, but if you follow the directions (completely idiot-proof), you should see results on a majority of them, as I have.  At the least, a zit that stayed on my face for 2 weeks can now be reduced to staying on my face for less than a week.  This is a big deal, b/c the longer the zit stays on you, the greater the chance to scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a medical device.  It is expensive, but the replacement tips are pretty reasonable.  As someone who sees a dermatologist, uses many different acne creams, potions, etc, I figured I had nothing to lose.  I am quite happy I bought it, and at least it offers some hope to reduce some adult acne.  I love that it is medication free and uses nothing more than heat. And don&#x27;t be afraid, it&#x27;s not so hot as to burn you.  It&#x27;s a nice warm heat, which if used properly, leaves nothing more than a redness around the zit for about 30 mins.</li>
    <li> i started using it like a couple of weeks ago and all of my pimples are gone, it just kills the bacteria in it and by the next day its gone, sometimes even in 8 hours. anytime i get a pimple i use it, i feel relief immediately, i absolutely love it. i am amazed with this Zeno and how quickly it works and how good it works. i would refer you to buy it because it is like a magic fairy pimople zapper.</li>
    <li> My Dad had originally bought this for my sister and I both to use, as we have acne.  The promise of clearing that 1 big stubborn zit overnight was so tempting, it was really too good to be true.    Zeno does not work.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use it twice a day or once a week, it does not get rid of your pimples.  That is the sad truth.    If anything, I think the heat irritated my sister and my pimples, and they turned bright red and looked worse after usage.      Don&#x27;t buy this product thinking it will help. Nice idea, awful execution.</li>
    <li> I have had my zeno for 2 years now and LOVE it!!! As a matter of fact it has helped me out of what could have been some very bad situations!!!! For example, 3 days before my sister&#x27;s wedding I get this gigantic zit on my chin!!! I start to freak out but started using my Zeno. By wedding day my chin was clear and the day was saved!!! I would recommend this product to anyone!! Thanks Zeno!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, and have had moderate acne since i was in my early teens. Not really bad, but enough to make me pick at it every now and then. The zeno product is great if you use it 3 times per day. But when you have more than one zit, and you&#x27;re using this 3 times per day, you use up an entire 60 cartridge zeno tip within a few days. I like the product a lot, I just wish that it weren&#x27;t so expensive. You have to think, $35 per 90 cartridge, I can go through that in a week, which comes about to be $140 per month on just cartridges. I&#x27;m sorry, but for that price I&#x27;d rather just wash my face and deal with the zits.</li>
    <li> I had the same results as another Amazon reviewer: B. Walker.  I&#x27;m in my early 30s and experience the occasional spot blemish on my face (T-zone).  After settling on the Zeno Pro because of the reviews here and elsewhere, I was relieved to finally have a devise to make my skin blemish free!  This week on Monday when I felt the developing pimple on my chin, I excitedly used the device as instructed over the course of 48 hours (cleaned the device, cleaned my face before application, and made sure not to scrub before or after).  Tomorrow is Friday, and my pimple has NOT disappeared.  In fact, I now have TWO really painful red inflamed pimples where I applied the device.  So much for clearing the pimples within 24 hours, and now I have obvious red bumps on my chin (not whiteheads; not blackheads).  Sadly, this device did not work as advertised (for me).  I&#x27;m now back to what my dermatologist had recommended: warm compresses with a warm towel (a nice steam facial), which has always done the trick for me.  I just thought that this device would be more convenient; less messy.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work ... in fact it makes the condition WORSE.</li>
    <li> What a nice addition to my beauty arsenol!  I know it sounds weird, but when I first got my Zeno, I was actually looking forward to my first zit!  It is just a really fun beauty tool that even my 18 year old son likes to use.  We just zap the zit and forget about it.  Usually by the following day, our face is clear with no other side effects such as flakey skin and so on.  It is gentle on the skin, plus it even works on the really deep zits that can be painful.  Our house is very happy!  The only thing you really need to do is charge it about once a week and it is always ready to go.  We are one year and one tip going strong!  What a cool, hip zit gadget!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Zeno for my daughter a year ago and it worked as advertised.  This year I purchased another Zeno for my other daughter.  The unit I received was defective - the adapter did not fit the unit, therefor the Zeno would not charge.  Without a charged battery, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I called Zeno 4 times.  All 4 times, my call went directly to voice mail with a promise to call me back.  I never got one call back.  I sent 3 emails.  One email got a response - the response was \\&quot;we&#x27;ll respond to you shortly.\\&quot;  I never did get a response.  All of this occurred over a period of about 3 weeks.  Finally, I contacted Amazon.  Even though I was now a few days beyond Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return period, they did the right thing and sent me a new Zeno.  Thank you Amazon!  If you buy this product, find it at a local store so you can return it if necessary.  I have a hard time recommending any product sold by a sleazy company.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 14 daughter who has occasional acne.  She uses it when she begins to feel the pimple form.  I was concerned that the tip would be hot and burn her face - but, to my surprise, it does not irritate her skin at all.  Using the Zeno seems to stop the pimple from coming up if she catches it early.  If she used the Zeno after the pimple comes out, it disappears  within a day or two.  I have also used the Zeno on occasion with great success.  I will definitely buy replacement tips and continue to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing after reading the reviews here and in some beauty mags.  I&#x27;ve battled acne my whole life.  I&#x27;m 35 and still have it.  Recently I had some laser resurfacing done on my face and thought I&#x27;d invest in this little gadget to help stave off the pimples. Invest being the operative word here because it is expensive.  I must be the 10% it doesn&#x27;t work for.  I even used it a second time after 4 hrs. as per instructed and no luck.  The pimples still came up.  [...]</li>
    <li> it burns so badly my skin that I stopped using it. I gave up. specially if your pimples come from black or white heads Zeno doens&#x27;t work at all because you have to take that little stuff out of the pimple anyway so for me it is very pricey and burns your skin. Doens&#x27;t work!  Dont waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a month and saw no good results.  I get big red pimples around my mouth from smoking and was hoping this product would help.  I didn&#x27;t.  It ended up in the closet and not ever being used.  I took it out recently to try it again, but it is broken, it won&#x27;t charge, turn on, anything, it&#x27;s only a year and a half old!  Oh well, a super waste of money :( and it was almost $200 when I bought it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to treat moderate acne. I know it isn&#x27;t supposed to treat cyctic acne, but I did try it out on a few and it did seem to make them smaller/disappear quicker. However, it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell whether it was due to using the Zeno or other acne medications.</li>
    <li> It only works sometimes, I don&#x27;t think it is worth almost $200.</li>
    <li> I bought the zeno just over a month ago, and been using it on a daily basis twice a day, and i&#x27;m very sad to say it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. i&#x27;ve used it on the early stage pimples and they only got bigger after i used it (just as they do without the zeno). I&#x27;ve seen no change whatsoever. I was conviced it would work from all the great reviews, but it didnt. on the up side, it was easy to use and battery lasts a long time i&#x27;ve only charged it twice in the past month. it is hot at first but you get used to it. the area does stay red for at least 5-10 minutes after use but i usually put on concealer to cover the spot anyway.</li>
    <li> What a great product! Originally heard about it from my dr., but only tried it just recently. It is basically foolproof.  There is no way to burn yourself.  Just follow the instructions, which are really easy. It feels warm, but still comfortable to the touch.  It does take a couple times to learn, but once you figure out the simple sequence, it does diminish new eruptions rather hastily. I am very content with my purchase and results.</li>
    <li> I got the Zeno about 3 years ago from my dermatologist&#x27;s office, and saw good results: it cleared up or minimized existing blemishes within a couple of days, and it looked to me like it also prevented new blemishes from appearing, thus clearing the skin over the course of several months.  Unfortunately, after about 18 months of usage, my Zeno started to malfunction; it would shut itself off automatically before a treatment was completed, then it stopped working altogether.  Too bad I had made a $150 investment that I thought would last me for years.  So, I was very encouraged to find out that there was a good alternative out there in the marketplace -- the Thermaclear device -- that did not need constant cartidge changes (I always thought that was a big rip-off with the Zeno), plus it worked much faster: a couple of seconds per zit instead of 2 1/2 minutes that can become very tedious at times.  So, I got myself a Thermaclear instead, and at first I loved it: granted, it certainly looks bulky and unelegant compared to the sleek Zeno, but after all, it&#x27;s an acne device and not an iPhone, so looks don&#x27;t really matter.  In addition, I felt that the much-criticised \\&quot;bee-sting\\&quot; sensation from the device when applied to the blemish was really a non-issue: yes, you feel it but it&#x27;s totally bearable.  However, after about 2-3 weeks of usage, I started to notice that my skin was red and irritated, and worse, that a lot of new zits were forming right next to the previously treated zits.  THe burning sensation on my skin intensified, and it persisted even hours after the treatment.  It may be that I over-used the device on my skin -- it&#x27;s so fast and easy to zap the zits that this may have been the case.  In any event, I decided to play it safe and returned the Thermaclear, and I reluctantly got myself to switch back to the Zeno -- yes, there&#x27;re definitely features that I do not like about the Zeno, but I must say after a Zeno treatment my skin feels fresh and \\&quot;clean from theinside\\&quot;, instead of irritated like with the Thermaclear.</li>
    <li> You have to try Zeno, I just love it!  I use it and it significantly improves the healing time.  There is no way it burns skin, unless you don&#x27;t follow the directions and use it stupidly with medicines or other acne treatments that cause skin sensitivity.  I will admit it does get hot, but it does not hurt or burn at all. I&#x27;ve found that keeping the unit charged on a regular basis ensures the battery lasts as designed.  This is a really good investment!</li>
    <li> Zeno is a wonderful invention for people (young or mature) who have blemishes.  You never know when one is going to pop up but it will happen when you least expect it.  I have so much confidence in this product that I know it will get rid of the blemish and not leave a red spot.  And you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting too hot because it automatically turns off at the preset time.  I am a Happy Camper knowing that I can rely on Zeno to \\&quot;do its thing\\&quot; and keep me from having those embarrassing moments from unwanted blemishes.  Get it, use it as directed and you will get the desired results.  I am a Happy Camper.</li>
    <li> I went on line recently to order a replacement tip (my 2nd in 2 years) and was very surprised to see some of the negative reviews.  I have to say I have been very pleased with my Zeno and have not had any of the experiences being posted ( no burning, no problem with blemish getting worse and no long term redness).  I just followed the directions and those pesky under the skin pimples go away in a day or two.  I think the key is to follow the directions.  I you happen to be in the small percentage of people that prefer another treatment option, you always have the option to return it within 30 days.  There is no risk and if you are like me, you will be thrilled you made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been frustrated when I know a zit is about to come up - usually right before something very important (or stressful) - and there is nothing I can do about it. Finally I have a way to stop them! It makes me feel good to know that I&#x27;m actually doing something, but also it really works!! A couple zaps every several hours really stops the zits from being a major breakout. Very cool and very easy. I also found it works even better on new zits. Use it as soon as you notice it. I can tell that some of the other reviewers with less desirable results did not do this. You really have to read (and follow) the directions on this one.</li>
    <li> I found out that if you don&#x27;t keep the unit charged, the battery stops working and the battery can&#x27;t be replaced. This is unlike any other rechargeable device I own, and it is in the literature but something as important as that should be highlighted. Why would anyone keep it charged all the time if they have only the occasional breakout? Anyway, a very expensive item now useless with no repair options.</li>
    <li> You hear a lot of mixed reviews regarding zeno, and personally, it did was not effective for my skin condition.  The product&#x27;s insert DOES disclaim that it is not effective for severe acne in the form of cystic acne so I can&#x27;t exactly be surprised by the outcome.  Still, since a lot of ppl claim that it worked for them, I tried it for a month.  I used the device right whenever I felt a zit forming, but to my disappointment I&#x27;d still get the breakout.</li>
    <li> Zeno is a nice skin tool for untimely blemishes.  It is much a necessity in my house now.  I suspect the reason for its mixed reviews is because you really must follow the directions.  However, I have to say I did notice more unnecessary negativity with the Zeno reviews on this site when I researched before buying...many which I have found to be unfounded now that I have used the Zeno personally.     It works much better than the traditional creams and lotions which just dry out the skin.  A deep, painful unsightly blemish that surfaced above my lip from yesterday morning is no longer visible...this is why I use it!  It works very effectively!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift from a dear friend, who had been using a Zeno for a while. She loved it and I played around with hers and liked the results. It works for those horrible under the skin bumps that take forever to go away. I love this product! I also like the size, I throw it in my makeup bag and go! I hope everyone enjoys the Zeno like I do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m single and much to old (in my opinion) to keep getting pimples. On more than one occasion I delayed asking out someone because I could tell a monster was forming on my face. I saw an add about Zeno and out of frustration (if not desperation) knew I had to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a few months now and I&#x27;ve never had a blemish rise to the point of embarressment. The trick is as soon as you can tell ones forming HIT IT!!! Follow the instructions and it will not pop out! Period!!! Wish I&#x27;d seen this thing a long time ago. Zeno is AWESOME and worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Zeno Pro 14 months ago. Since purchase, my Zeno has not held a battery charge for longer than one use. I could charge my Zeno for a full 24 hours, and I still would get only one use out of the device. I was not aware Zeno had a 12 month warranty only. I just now got around to calling for service or replacement, and was told they do not offer repair, and will not replace because I was 2 months outside of the warrantly window. Unbelievable. Defective product, and a company that clearly does not stand by it&#x27;s product. As for performance controlling acne, I also would not recommend. I don&#x27;t think it had any impact whatsoever. It may work for those that only get occasional, tiny blemishes. Avoid dealing with this company!</li>
    <li> The zeno looks pretty, but just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Two and a half minutes is far too long if you have more than one pimple to treat. 5 pimples at 2 treatments a day comes out to 25 minutes not including the ridiculous warm up times this thing has. Good luck using Zeno without standing in a mirror and repositioning the tiny treatment plate every 2 seconds to make sure it is touching in the proper spot. Not to mention that the tip has to be replaced every x number of days.    As for results, I wasn&#x27;t able to see results using the zeno. Maybe this is due to the fact that I simply didn&#x27;t have enough time to do the proper number of treatments on each pimple. If you&#x27;re looking for an acne treatment device that utilizes this technology, save yourself hours of time and go with the thermaclear. Zeno is worthless as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> I got the Zeno three years ago as a Christmas gift. I&#x27;d never had bad acne, but i did get that really horrible pimple always right before my birthday or new years (twice!) and at least once a month. Mine have always been really deep and swollen and hurt really bad. I was a little skeptical, i mean it&#x27;s just heat right, what can it do? well first off, you have to take it at the first sign of a pimple. it won&#x27;t work if you already have a head on it (but it does make it feel better).   Usually it took over two weeks to really get rid of those deep pimples, but i did notice that if i applied the Zeno at the first sign and before i went to bed, it didn&#x27;t get a head on it and the swelling went down significantly. the pimple was completely gone within the week. I owe my life to it,i noticed right before new years eve 2007 that i started to get that sore feeling under my skin on my chin, and applied the Zeno twice a day for 3 days and by new years, you couldn&#x27;t even tell anymore! that really got me hooked.  Now i use it to prevent pimples during that time of the month. it really helps control those read bumps around my nose and my chin.   I highly recommend this product!!! it&#x27;s been three years and only about three or four refills. you really get your money out of it. it&#x27;s worth it to not have that third eye on your forehead or that really ugly swollen mountain on your chin. and those who don&#x27;t like this product are probably from the competing Zeno knock-off. BEWARE!! I&#x27;ve done the research because the other one is a bit cheaper and i like to compare before i buy. But from what i&#x27;ve read and heard, it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. so pay the extra $20, it is well worth it!   oh! and i&#x27;m totally jealous now because it comes in different colors! mine is silver. but they are really small (smaller than an iphone) and fit well in my purse for emergency use!</li>
    <li> After seeing Zeno on the Today Show last week, I went out and bought one.  Wow! I used this last night on 4 spots while watching the news...2 spots were on my neck and another one right above my cheekbone.  This morning, all 3 were completely GONE!  The 4th spot that I used it on was an old pimple that I had previously picked which you aren&#x27;t supposed to do, but it even looks significantly better today too.  This is just so much better than creams, not drying at all either!  I did get a slight pinkness on just 1 of the 4 treated areas, but it was gone by the time the news was over...amazing technology!</li>
    <li> I have owned my own day spa business for over 10 years and have carried Zeno in my spa since it was introduced.  Bar none, Zeno is one of my top spa product sellers.  My clients love it because it works on most of their blemishes and because it contains no harsh, drying chemicals.  I even had one client that came back to me saying that it saved her during pregnancy, because her doctor would not prescribe her any meds because of her condition.  It is a safe, natural alternative for removing blemishes and I will continue to carry it in my spa.</li>
    <li> The product does work, however the 90 count cartridge that came with the device only worked for 12 or so uses.  Very disappointed.  I should have purchased it in the regular store; I would have had better luck with it working like it said.  I wonder how long the product was on the shelf when it was sold to me?  And, how the life of the product declines when inactive?</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this device but cannot use it because it&#x27;s too hot for my skin.  I tested it out first on my arm and it was burning hot! My mother tested it out on her arm but felt fine.  Luckily it came with a 30 day money back guaranteed. If your skin is sensitive to heat don&#x27;t have high hopes for Zeno.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard the people who say it doesn&#x27;t work, but it works GREAT for me!! I think the reason people have some trouble with it is if they start using it too late. I don&#x27;t get pimples too often, maybe one like once or twice a month. I always use it right when I feel that soreness when you know a pimple is blooming!! I use it twice, maybe three times on the upcoming pimple, and it never even makes it to the full-on red pimple stage, it just disappears. The bottom line is that you can look at absolutely any acne product on this site, and there will be people it didn&#x27;t work for. Zeno seems like it&#x27;s best for people like me who get occasional pimples that screw up their week, not for a whole faceful of perpetual acne. Just my opinion, but I love mine and I&#x27;ve bought them for friends too - all the bridesmaids in my wedding got Zeno&#x27;s as bridesmaids gifts!</li>
    <li> I started using Zeno a few years ago. I had tried everything from ProActive to over the counter items and nothing seemed to work. As I&#x27;m approaching 30, I was getting really tired of having to cover up my pimples. At first I was skeptical trying out Zeno because I figured that like the previous products I&#x27;ve tried, that it wouldn&#x27;t work. Boy was I wrong (and I&#x27;m glad I was wrong!). As soon as I felt or saw a pimple coming in, I would immediately start my Zeno treatment. It would actually stop the pimple from getting bigger and it cleared up a lot sooner than it would have using a topical medication. Zeno is even small enough to carry around in your purse, which is was I love. I totally recommend this product to anyone who would like clear skin!</li>
