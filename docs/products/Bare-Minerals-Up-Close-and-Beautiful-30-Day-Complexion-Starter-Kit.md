      <li>I do love bareMinerals makeup and mineral veil, but I could&#x27;ve gotten much more product for $10.00</li>
      <li>However I should have read it better..</li>
      <li>this is more like a trial sized version.</li>
      <li>Should have read the description more thoroughly.</li>
      <li>more so this is deceiving.  </li>
      <li>Love it will never wear anything else again.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff,used it since out on market.</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a try when a lot of reviews I  read were saying it made your skin better..</li>
      <li>It works out because you can get a lot of use out of it since you shouldn&#x27;t use too much of the product at a time anyway and the Mini Full Flawless brush works great as smaller brush tool for precision powder use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend doing business with this seller!!</li>
      <li>The product is good but the online pic is very misleading and not at all a bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Ran out VERY quickly.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals is a great product.</li>
      <li>It covers acne, age spots and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines like liquid make up.</li>
      <li>Was delivered quickly!  </li>
      <li>I got too light of a shade</li>
      <li>Love love love bare minerals!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good way to test the product, but be aware that they are very small/sample sizes.  </li>
      <li>It barely covered and to get good coverage</li>
      <li>Either oily or dry, this make-up is great for all skin types.  </li>
      <li>The product is great but the package was crushed when it came</li>
      <li>Wasnt such a good deal.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting the full size of everything in the kit when I bought this.</li>
      <li>Just buy the full size.</li>
      <li>Very small but perfect for my commute back-up kit!</li>
      <li>This is decent make-up, but I was hoping for better coverage.  </li>
      <li>You would be better off to pay 10.00 more and get a bigger kit.</li>
      <li>shipped quickly as promised</li>
      <li>Fast and easy to Apply can be finished</li>
      <li>love it, it offers coverage as well as absorbs oil!</li>
      <li>These products are amazing, and I doubt I will go back to my liquids again!</li>
      <li>it is the most natural looking makeup.  </li>
      <li>I had to laugh when I got it.</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years; however, the contents are about a months worth and a small amount.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for full size product this set is not for you however if you need smaller compact size for travel or to carry in your purse than you will love it.</li>
      <li>This particular set is very small, perfect for travel or in your purse for emergencies.</li>
      <li>I have thought about trying this product for a long time since it claims to have amazing results.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it was so small, but BareMinerals is by far the most amazing for your skin!</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals.  </li>
      <li>Love the bare minerals line</li>
      <li>Overall am satisfied with products sent.</li>
      <li>It is a good starter kit but the brushes are smaller than the ones that are used regularly.</li>
      <li>The products were smaller in size the tiny little brushes were cute and great for purse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve  wanted to try bareminerals for a very long time but didnt want to fork up the dough for something I  wasnt sure about.</li>
      <li>You can get this set much cheaper, and the full size one for a few dollars more.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t cover my cystic acne as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and you really don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing make-up at all.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s  very embarrassing  </li>
      <li>It was wrapped in nice white tissue with a pretty ribbon, packaged well, and came sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>Great gift to carry around small containes smaller brushes,  would buy again</li>
      <li>I love these products, I use them all the time but the size is seriously not worth the price.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be the big box, which I could have bought for ten dollars more</li>
      <li>what I expected butmaybe there was fine print with the sizes that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking, doesn&#x27;t make you break out.</li>
      <li>Could have ordered in greater quantity directly from bare minerals for less money.</li>
      <li>but as I&#x27;ve aged my skin is more on the dry side.  </li>
      <li>I have adult acne,  </li>
      <li>Old and wrinkled now using the liquid form</li>
      <li>Love the product but the brushes are very small</li>
      <li>I bought into bareMinerals when it first started, naïve enough to believe they would still sell same sizes.  </li>
      <li>I use only bare minerals have for years</li>
      <li>After doing this, there was often too much powder, and no matter what I do, I find I have a mess on my counter.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product hate the price for one month use</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals.  it is the most natural looking makeup.  it still provides great coverage while not caking up in any creases or lines that you may have on your face.  it also does not cake up in your pores.  it gives you a little shimmer to your skin for an almost dewy effect.  It holds up well to sweat which is very important  to me when I am out in the field doing army stuff.  love it.</li>
    <li> I really like it it was smaller than I thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> Excellent product transport and quality!! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend doing business with this seller!!</li>
    <li> makeup looks much larger in the picture but when i get the package the makeup containers are tiny. tried to contact seller to swap out for something else and have yet to hear from them. would not recommend</li>
    <li> This is decent make-up, but I was hoping for better coverage.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but I had a really difficult time covering up blemishes with this product.  Additionally, I don&#x27;t like the way the product is packaged.  In order to get enough make-up to actually provide coverage, I had to put the lid on and then turn it upside down.  After doing this, there was often too much powder, and no matter what I do, I find I have a mess on my counter.  I think that this would be a very nice product for someone without blemishes, though.  It is very lightweight and you really don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing make-up at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize these were minis but I like the product</li>
    <li> Was terribly small, not a good value at all!</li>
    <li> Smaller everything than I expected. Should have read the description more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love this?</li>
    <li> These products are amazing, and I doubt I will go back to my liquids again!</li>
    <li> Liked the makeup, was disappointed by how small they were. Ran out VERY quickly.</li>
    <li> Makeup doesn&#x27;t stay on through a work day</li>
    <li> Great products.  I used this kit to replenish my travel supplies.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful....but they are trial sizes, very small amounts!  Not worth the cost!  Could have ordered in greater quantity directly from bare minerals for less money.</li>
    <li> Maybe I should have seen somewhere how small these are, but was shocked when they arrived.  The biggest one is the size of quarter. Based on the price, totally not worth it.  You can get this set much cheaper, and the full size one for a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> So disappointed in the size for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy about it. I thought it was going to be the big box, which I could have bought for ten dollars more and I can&#x27;t even return it. Don&#x27;t waist your money on this.</li>
    <li> So so small... rip off...</li>
    <li> I was surprised, and a little disappointed, in the small quantities of each item.  It seems like a &#x27;travel size&#x27; or a &#x27;starter kit.&#x27;  But the quality of the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have thought about trying this product for a long time since it claims to have amazing results.  In my experience, if you are looking for good coverage, this is not for you!  It barely covered and to get good coverage, it looked like I was wearing a ton of makeup.  It also didn&#x27;t last all day.  I have used a LOT of different make up products and this is the worst one I have every used.  Plus it is way too expensive!</li>
    <li> Great gift to carry around small containes smaller brushes,  would buy again</li>
    <li> love it, it offers coverage as well as absorbs oil! no greasy shine!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel awesome and the foundation lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this make-up for at least 10 years now.  It is my favorite foundation and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  The cover is amazing.  I used to have oily skin but as I&#x27;ve aged my skin is more on the dry side.  Either oily or dry, this make-up is great for all skin types.  I am always getting compliments and people asking what kind of foundation I use.  I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,used it since out on market. Old and wrinkled now using the liquid form</li>
    <li> Read product details closely before buying.  This set is half the size of what you can purchase in the store for 70 bucks. this is more like a trial sized version.</li>
    <li> Tiny box! I had to laugh when I got it. It&#x27;s not like the other bare mineral starter kits. It&#x27;s a very small container of each item. The product is good but the online pic is very misleading and not at all a bang for your buck. You would be better off to pay 10.00 more and get a bigger kit.</li>
    <li> Teeny tiny travel size - not what I expected butmaybe there was fine print with the sizes that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to.</li>
    <li> nice makeup, but it didn&#x27;t cover my cystic acne as much as I&#x27;d like. Hopefully it will clear up with my doctors help so the makeup will look nicer, but I was a little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;revolutionary&amp;#34; like in the commercials.</li>
    <li> This is a sample kit. I thought I was getting the full size of everything in the kit when I bought this. But it is a sample kit. The containers are small. I do like the brushes that came with it.</li>
    <li> Great product, seller, and transaction. Very pleased thank you!!😀👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> I use only bare minerals have for years</li>
    <li> The products were smaller in size the tiny little brushes were cute and great for purse. Overall am satisfied with products sent. If you are looking for full size product this set is not for you however if you need smaller compact size for travel or to carry in your purse than you will love it.</li>
    <li> favorite makeup packaged great</li>
    <li> Bare minerals is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and I love it.  This particular set is very small, perfect for travel or in your purse for emergencies. Will not last longer than three weeks.</li>
    <li> I love these products, I use them all the time but the size is seriously not worth the price. I regret making this purchase.</li>
    <li> TINY sample size of the product. I thought it was the basic sizes and was very disappointed. I feel it was overpriced for sample size products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good way to test the product, but be aware that they are very small/sample sizes.  The foundation and mineral veil powder are about the same size as a single eye shadow pot.  The brushes are great, though, perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years; however, the contents are about a months worth and a small amount. It is a good starter kit but the brushes are smaller than the ones that are used regularly. It was wrapped in nice white tissue with a pretty ribbon, packaged well, and came sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I was also expecting regular sized amounts of this product.  THESE ARE REALLY SMALL AMOUNTS.  I do love bareMinerals makeup and mineral veil, but I could&#x27;ve gotten much more product for $10.00 more so this is deceiving.  If you have an Ulta or BareMinerals locally, I suggest you go there to buy.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than expected :/</li>
    <li> loves the feel on her skin</li>
    <li> Love it will never wear anything else again. Fast and easy to Apply can be finished I vey few min</li>
    <li> I was under the impression this was a regular sized product. Not a sample size. It is only 10.00 less than the regular starter kit at Ulta. Thought I was getting a deal. Cannot even return the product. Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to tell what the actual size of makeup is...and these were tiny.  The product is great but I hate the packaging.</li>
    <li> It was really small. Wasnt such a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love love love bare minerals!!!</li>
    <li> Way to little product for the price.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the package was crushed when it came and it was a Christmas gift!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good starter kit to see if you are going to like the product.  That way you haven&#x27;t wasted a lot of money before you know if it&#x27;s right for you.  Plus, there&#x27;s no auto renewal.</li>
    <li> This is the very tiny package of stuff.  The product is great just though.</li>
    <li> i was under the impression that the contents were regular size!  It also stayes $22 on my box and I paid $39.95 for this!! How disappointing!!</li>
    <li> Love the product but the brushes are very small</li>
    <li> These are very small sample sizes. Not worth the money. Just buy the full size.</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect! All those items for a low price! Bare Minerals always has great coverage! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t give it up!</li>
    <li> Very small but perfect for my commute back-up kit!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the sizes were until they arrived. I also remember loving bareminerals when I used it a couple years ago. Now, even when using the primer and mineral viel along with the foundation it&#x27;s starts to come off and look splotchy and oily after a couple hours of wear.</li>
    <li> could not read anything print too small</li>
    <li> Was delivered quickly!  I&#x27;ve  wanted to try bareminerals for a very long time but didnt want to fork up the dough for something I  wasnt sure about. I decided to give it a try when a lot of reviews I  read were saying it made your skin better.. I have adult acne,  it&#x27;s  very embarrassing  and my makeup was not helping so in desperation i bought this starter kit.  I got too light of a shade but I  am SOLD it covers everything! My pimples dont show i mean the bumps are there but the color of my face is all even the dark under eye area is gone and my skin is actually healing!  I LOVE the primer, its my favorite item in this kit, i have been using it as a moisturizer because it just seems to make my face look and feel better.</li>
    <li> My husband says I don&#x27;t need makeup.  I don&#x27;t care what he says, I&#x27;m going to keep buying this makeup.  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love the bare minerals line but I didn&#x27;t know this was a travel size kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a starter gift once I found out my grand daughter at 12 had started experimenting with makeup.  I also purchased some makeup books to help her avoid the &amp;#34;blue eye shadow&amp;#34; stage.</li>
    <li> to small for the price</li>
    <li> shipped quickly as promised</li>
    <li> Includes what it says, delivered on time.. However I should have read it better.. these are sample sizes. Extremly small. It works out because you can get a lot of use out of it since you shouldn&#x27;t use too much of the product at a time anyway and the Mini Full Flawless brush works great as smaller brush tool for precision powder use. again.. TESTER SIZE.</li>
    <li> Greatly disappointed in the small sizes, colors.  I bought into bareMinerals when it first started, naïve enough to believe they would still sell same sizes.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was so small, but BareMinerals is by far the most amazing for your skin! Very natural looking, doesn&#x27;t make you break out. Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Bareminerals more than met my expectations for coverage.  It covers acne, age spots and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines like liquid make up.</li>
