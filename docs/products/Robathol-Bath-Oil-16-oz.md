      <li>I feel super soft and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Needs to come in large bottles</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s accurate to call it dry necessarily.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like it as it was highly recommended to me by a friend who likes the product very much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this stuff helps my baby&#x27;s skin in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin that gets dry and irritated by products and the changes of temperature and altitude. This is a life saving product. This makes my skin super soft and keeps it that way where I live at sea level, even during the winter. When I visit high altitude locations I bring it with me. Pre robathol, my trips to high altitudes would have me dry and itchy and miserable.  Now I go and I maintain normal moist skin.</li>
    <li> Not too oily. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my allergist.  Helps with dry itchy skin!</li>
    <li> Seems to help with eczema if you mix it half and half with water in a spray bottle and then spray it on (after you have washed and rinsed in the shower) and then just rinse off the water/Robathol mixture and pat yourself dry (don&#x27;t rub with the towel).  I haven&#x27;t tried it as a bath oil additive, but have read that one cap full is great there.  I just don&#x27;t take baths.</li>
    <li> I switched from Aveeno&#x27;s bath oil to Robathol when I realized that Aveeno&#x27;s version has a fragrance and my doctor ordered me to go fragrance-free. The oil works great. No scent. Do need to be careful getting out of the tub as it makes things slippery. It&#x27;s not as think as Aveeno&#x27;s bath oil but works just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> Must agree with positive reviews: great for dry skin, no bathtub residue, just ordered more.</li>
    <li> THis is a great product for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil. Dry itchy skin is a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now is softer than a babies but. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Rumor has it Dr&#x27;s from the Mayo Clinic created this Vanicream brand products for their patients with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;It really works.</li>
    <li> Works great for my dry skin</li>
    <li> Our doctor recommended Robathol Bath Oil for our son&#x27;s dry skin when he showed irritation from regular baby oil. Robathol Bath Oil is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it. Its only downside is its buildup in our bathtub, and on our tub toys, as it clings to those surfaces as well as it does our son&#x27;s skin. Still, the extra elbow-grease it requires is a welcome tradeoff for how much it helps our son.</li>
    <li> Have tried several different bath oils for my son&#x27;s eczema and this is my favorite by far! He gets out of the bath every time with soft hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in the bath for both of my children for the last 18 mos. It really does the trick on keeping their skin moisturized. Both have suffered with eczema since birth. We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I love this Robathol Oil!  It makes my skin soo soft! It even got the husk off my dry feet! I have pretty feet now!</li>
    <li> Well, the short answer is that Robathol is just too oily for me. To be a bit more specific, no matter how well you rinse, there is still an oily feel which some might like, but  is not for me.  I really wanted to like it as it was highly recommended to me by a friend who likes the product very much.</li>
    <li> works well with psoriasis or just dry skin and is slip resistant in bath tub so you dont slip while getting out</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 2 year old who has eczema based on the allergy specialist&#x27;s recommendation.  I don&#x27;t think it made any different in her skin at all.  It&#x27;s a bath oil, but when you pour it into the bath water the water gets cloudy, but doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any difference in the water...no moisturizing oily feel at all.  I even double-up on the recommended amount...still no difference.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works really well with Vanicream lotion for my infants eczema.  This was suggested by my infants allergist and I am so pleased!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous for a one with allergies to anything in skin care products.  Use in the shower and mix with Vanicream and spread on skin to relieve complaints of dry skin.  Excellent product and the price was better than anything I could source locally.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have psorasis and it has helped me so much. Thank you</li>
    <li> I applied this after showering and before drying off; used on a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation, it did a good job of keeping my skin moist, but I discontinued after I tired of smelling like cooking oil. It took months for my towels to be free of the odor.</li>
    <li> great product. leaves skin nice and smooth after a 15 min bath. easy to use. another great product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This has not helped my 3 year old at all.  Need to go to something else.  This does not even contain the eczema.</li>
    <li> I use robathol bath oil in my bath and it helps soothe and protect my dry skin.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist as part of a daily regime to prevent and treat eczema.</li>
    <li> Nice to add to bath water!</li>
    <li> Tghe dermatologis recommended.  It works.  My son thinks it makes the tub too slippery.  I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The Mayo Clinic started my wife on this oil years ago and she uses it every day.  But Mayo sometimes runs out or their pharmacy is closed when we are in the town where the clinic is.  This gives us another source and we are happy to get it.</li>
    <li> I am a very allergic person and am glad to have found a bath oil that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use this on a wash clothes to scrub my face and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I live in a very arid climate and have to use lotion (from the same company) daily. Multiple times in the winter. I decided to give this stuff a try and will now use it for as long as it&#x27;s made. So easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess in the shower or tub. Also don&#x27;t use very much. It has no smell whatsoever which is a plus if you want to add a bit of a nice smelling EO or what have you. Big win !!</li>
    <li> My three children have eczema and unfortunately for them, this oil didn&#x27;t help out at all.  The only thing I accomplished with it was making the tub super slippery.  The smell is vey unpleasant too...  I would give my kids a bath at bedtime and the next morning the whole bathroom would smell like rancid cooking oil.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading several reviews that this product was going to help in moisturizing my skin. I had severe eczema for my whole life (26 years) and have tried everything. This oil didn&#x27;t do anything for me but cause more itching and broken skin. I contacted the company that produces this product after doing some research on cottonseed oil. Which contains high amounts of pesticides! Which I do not care to place on my sensitive skin to be absorbed. The company did reply back but only avoided my question about the use of pesticides saying it was a food grade oil. I&#x27;ve read several reviews about people actually using this potentially harmful oil on an infant! Very disappointed and will be looking for something organic.</li>
    <li> If your child has problem skin, this product is the best! We saw immediate improvement in my daughter&#x27;s skin.She was scratching to bleeding her eczema and this was a life saver! Anytime she has a flareup, I go right back to adding this to the bath water. I always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for many years. It work well.I recommend it for those who suffer from very dry skin.</li>
    <li> We use for son&#x27;s severe eczema in baths.  Don&#x27;t use often, but is fine when we do.</li>
    <li> I love Robathhol, it really soothes my skin. My skin is sensitive, I have a light case of psoriasis, and is terribly dry in winter. I have bought this product for years and will buy it again. It is the only thing that I have found that works for relief.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and this was recommended by the dermatologist. We have been using this product for about a year and it does help with keeping the skin moist.</li>
    <li> Works great for eczema!</li>
    <li> My daughter was dealing with mild eczema since birth, after doing some research online I found this product from another parent. I got instant results from using this product. I would it was a week and her skin was totally clear and have been since then. I have been using this product about a year now and love it. I use this everyday for her bath then use cerave cream mixed with eucerin aquaphor after bath. She has not had any problems with her skin since using these products.</li>
    <li> It helps with the skin of my medium-eczema 4 year old, especially when you can do it regularly and follow up with cream 3 min after- perfect. But get a shower cap for the hair! And clean the tub after, besides of slippery you&#x27;ll have the grime ring from Stickytown.</li>
    <li> Personally, I poured the entire contents into a large spray bottle and filled it with water. After I shower, while I&#x27;m still standing in the shower I spray myself with the &amp;#34; mixture. &amp;#34;  A little goes a long way. And then I step out and let the air dry my body. End result, my skin is soft and I&#x27;ve use little of the product. It is NOT greasy.</li>
    <li> I received my stuff a day early, &amp; the oil really seems to be helping my son with infant eczema.</li>
    <li> I have been using Robathol for several years, now, and no longer try one cream or lotion after another to relieve my winter-dry skin.  What a relief to know that I can take a normal shower, then rub a light film of this all over, rinse off with tepid water (so I don&#x27;t rinse it away) and not have to worry about itchy skin. I have friends who go south in the winter to escape the itch. This stuff is a bit pricey, but a lot more affordable than relocating for the winter! Don&#x27;t pick a travel destination to accommodate dry skin! I buy gallon bottles and then put it in glass bottles - it has kept very well for several years. P.S. Don&#x27;t towel yourself dry vigorously after this: blot lightly to leave to light film of oil on your skin.</li>
    <li> When my daughter&#x27;s ezcema flares up, her dermatologist recommended she do soak baths with a little of this in it.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a pump on top though.  The can snaps up but oil runs down the side of the bottle each time you close it.  A pump would help you get the same amount in each time (so many pumps per so many inches of water in the tub.</li>
    <li> 2nd Bottle!  I love it, after a shower, mixed with water or unscented lotion, makes for moist /soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we ordered!! Delivered quickly! No complaints. Great product for kids with severe dry skin and eczema. It was recommended by the Mayo clinic for our 2 yr old son.</li>
    <li> Skin oil is very comfortable, I want to stick there effect.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old has been suffering from eczema and I purchased this product after the great reviews. There&#x27;s no smell, it turns the water slightly cloudy and however it did absolutely nothing for my son&#x27;s eczema. It was no better and no worse. I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> My son has had eczema since he was born. His pediatric dermatologist has him soak in the tub every other night with some of the oil . That and then the creme after does wonders for his skin!!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil it does it job and some</li>
    <li> I bought this for our 5 month old baby girl.  Ever since she was born, she has had dry scalp and our doctor perscribed a couple different creams to try as well as the remedies for treating cradle cap (though that&#x27;s not what it was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing worked, but my inlaws used Robathol for their children after visiting the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.  We&#x27;re fortunate to live nearby.  I&#x27;ve been using it in my baby&#x27;s tub for about 2 weeks and absolutely love it.  I noticed a huge difference after just 2 baths (with only a tsp in her tub of water!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be spendy, but it goes a long way, and is totally worth it.  No artificial scents, parabens, dyes, perfumes, etc. completely natural.</li>
    <li> My skin becomes extremely itchy at night in the Winter. I guess it&#x27;s from all the dry air in my room.  My skin feels soft so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s accurate to call it dry necessarily. But I itch to the point where I&#x27;m close to drawing blood sometimes.  It&#x27;s awful. I literally wake up sometimes just itching like crazy.  It was unbearable.  I use Eucerin&#x27;s skin calming body wash which soothes me for a while but always within hours (sometimes within the hour) the itchies are back. I&#x27;ve tried the Eucerin lotion, Goldbond triple strength itch lotion, Cortisol cream, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  I even take Alegra to tone down the histamines in my body when it gets really bad. Enter Robathol.  From the very first time I used it my skin stopped itching. I can now last 24 hours without itching!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s a miracle product.  I can only surmise that maybe there&#x27;s something in the other products I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin. This product is made for sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of additional stuff. Whatever the case is, it SO WORKS.  If you have dry, itchy, Winter skin, I encourage you to try this!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for people with eczema and those wanting something additional to moisturize your skin.</li>
    <li> I like Robathol Bath Oil for my hands. I have eczema on my hands and this oil really keeps them moist</li>
    <li> Great Bath Oil.  I use this at the end of my shower and it helps seal in the moisture.  I have Sjogrens Syndrome Disorder and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it for her dry, itchy skin. She dabs it on after a shower, and likes it, but thinks it&#x27;s a little too runny. She said it&#x27;d be perfect if it were a little thicker.</li>
    <li> This oil is remarkable. I add one tablespoon to my bath water and after one use I could tell a difference in my skin. I also use the vanicream soap and cream however, I was already using the soap and cream and when I added just one tablespoon of this oil the results were even better than before. The robathol oil, vanicream soap and the vanicream combined has produced amazing results with my moderate eczema. The rashes on my legs are still unsightly but the itching has practically stopped and these products has calmed my eczema down dramatically. You do not need to use more than one tablespoon of this oil in a full bath. Anyone who is suffering from eczema or similar skin conditions needs to try vanicream products they are truly amazing.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician prescribed this oil for his sensitive body and to keep his body moisturized, This oil it worked to a extent though I noticed my baby&#x27;s body is getting red spots over the body not sure if this is the oil which is causing all this. So, I am using this oil on every alternative day and I hope things will get better soon.</li>
    <li> Works very well for eczema or dry skin.  Takes the itchies away.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin, and taking a weekly bath with a big squirt of Robathol makes a huge difference.  My doctor recommended that I try it, and she was right.  My skin absorbs this bath oil better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It works, and my skin stays soft and hydrated for several days after a bath with it.  Use very warm water and soak for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Received items as described. No leakage; no damage.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I try a bath oil for dry itchy skin. I did some research on the net and several pediatricians and dermatologists recommended this product. So I tried it. It works great! No itchiness, no greasy feeling, no residue left in the shower. I love it!</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic. Its thicker than a Neutrogena body oil but doesn&#x27;t feel thick on the skin.  When wet, it is very easy to rub in.  I bought it for the kiddo, but have found myself using it as well. This will probably become a mainstay in our house.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Needs to come in large bottles</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I have suffered from life-long eczema, and have just come out of a year-long battle with Topical Steroid Withdrawal (www.itsan.org - look into it if you have eczema!). I need something to help keep my skin moisturized, and to help keep the eczema at bay. This stuff is great! I slather it on at the end of my shower and rinse. I feel super soft and it lasts all day. Sometimes I throw 1-2TBS into the bath, and soak - which is also great. It&#x27;s really helped with the rough, patchy, scaly eczema problem areas!</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old has really bad eczema and is very skin sensative to many soaps and such. After his dr. recommended this when he was 1 we&#x27;ve used it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Does a great job at moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;  Only need a capfull for a bath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t help extreme eczema&lt;br /&gt;  Can make tub slippery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its better than plain bath water.</li>
    <li> Helps with my son&#x27;s eczema.  Great product but does leave the bath toys a little oily.</li>
    <li> The oil is great. The bottle, however, does not seal well. Do not let it tip over or you will have oil everywhere.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our Allergy doctor to help our child with his eczema problem. It really works, it helped subside the eczema and clears my son&#x27;s skin. We usually mix it with water in the bath tub when my son is going to take a bath. We let him sit there and play in the bath tub for several minutes and soak himself. The only down side of this item is, since its an oil based product its hard to clean the tub and you must be careful while putting your child in the tub because it can get very slippery when you mix it with water. Otherwise its a very good product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bath oil. It has helped my chronic dry skin better than anything else I have tried. I did try mixing it with water and putting it in a spray bottle to use after a shower. It worked terrifically, but after a few weeks the spray started to smell like an old sponge. I&#x27;d recommend using a small spray bottle and changing it out often.</li>
    <li> works well for allergies but leaves gummy residue in tub</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it would help keep my elbows from painfully drying out.  It did not seem to make any difference when added to the bath or applied after a shower.  I noticed a few odd break-outs as well so I discontinued use well before the bottle ran out.  Back to the coconut oil!</li>
    <li> My father&#x27;s dermatologist recommends this product.  Dad has extremely dry, itchy skin.  He says this oil helps the best of any he&#x27;s tried.</li>
