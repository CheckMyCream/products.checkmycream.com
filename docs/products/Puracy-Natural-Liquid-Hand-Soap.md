<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product! It is gentle on my hands, has a great scent and cleans well. I plan to purchase the hand soap again.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients and it works well!</li>
    <li> love it and the smell good</li>
    <li> Overall the product is good and seems to work well in cleaning my hands.  I would say the consistency is a little watered down for me and the smell is just okay.  I would love to see Puracy make a citrus scent and thicken up the formula a bit if possible.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this soap! The smell is wonderful and very soothing. Gentle on the hands. It is getting harder and harder to find products Made in the USA. Sign me a Proud Texan born and raised.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients, smells nicely, way to go!</li>
    <li> My hands don&#x27;t feel dry after using.</li>
    <li> From the first hand washing, I fell in love with this soap. My hands feel so soft and clean. I didn&#x27;t realize how much residue was left on after washing with other liquid soap. With multiple washing a day my hands are never dried out. The fragrance is very, very light and pleasing.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and glad you have this refill bottle for the pump bottles I ready have. Love that it&#x27;s all natural!!</li>
    <li> A good hand soap. We wanted a pure, non-antibacterial soap. The fragrance is very light.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It&#x27;s all natural and smells amazing. I use it even to wash my baby&#x27;s hands.</li>
    <li> I tried this type of hand soap at a friends house and asked where I could find it but her only response was \\&quot;I could get it everywhere\\&quot;. So I went to the internet. (Couldn&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere else).  Really do like it and iwill buy it again. Ty</li>
    <li> The best hand soap ever  Color is muted , the feeling on your skin makes you know you made the right choice in buying. If I could give 10 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> Loving the smell and how gentle this soap is. And I reread the ingredients after receiving it and was happy again to see all the plant based ingredients.</li>
    <li> This natural soap is awesome!  It lathers up quickly, has a most pleasant fragrance, and is one I will order again. It is hard to find a liquid hand soap that doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it. Thank you for a wonderful soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because my hands were really dry and hurting all the time.  I started thinking that maybe if I bought a nice natural soap with vitamin E in it, it might help.  I searched on Amazon and found this.  I swapped all the hand soap around the house for this soap.  After using it for about 3 weeks my hands were no longer cracking and hurting.  I also really love their body wash which has a different scent.  Great products, keep up the good work guys!</li>
    <li> New packaging and formula is great--best hand soap ever. Wonderful scent, cleans well, does not dry hands.   Past review, 2 stars: Product arrived broken and spilled in and through box and made a stain on my rug. Also, product is more liquid than I like.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out like most other soaps. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> The all Natural Hand Soap is wonderful. I like the scent and the smoothness of the soap</li>
    <li> This is very nice soap. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the soap has a bit of a cloudy look that you may not want if you are putting it in clear soap dispensers. BUT I spoke with the company and they were VERY RESPONSIVE and they said that the cloudiness is perfectly natural (does not indicate a problem in the soap) and they are working on getting a formula that won&#x27;t get cloudy, just for the aesthetics. I also bought the Puracy dish soap, lime-something, and it was perfect!</li>
    <li> We use this soap at our business. We provide therapy for children and have 8 bathrooms. We wanted an all-natural soap with a mild fragrance that is easy on the pocketbook and Puracy is great! We have tried other products but this one is the best. We like it so much that we have now started using it at home as well!</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was leaking a bit when it arrived but I can&#x27;t complain because why was I buying liquid soap on amazon anyways? Regardless, this soap is amazing with a rather pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with my purchases from Amazon, until now.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed when I opened the box. My French cook book was placed in box without a bag and the soap must have leaked out, and got on my cookbook. I had to wipe book off, to send it all back is too expensive for me, not worth it. I will have to rethink if I want to order a liquid again, since packaging was not what I would have expected.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product.  It is soft on your hands and has a very nice smell.  Love it.  I think I will order for the rest of the house!  My family even want some for theirs!</li>
    <li> love this and works great</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand soap that had better ingredients and this looks pretty good. It works well at cleaning my hands. I like to use products that have no odor but I didn&#x27;t seem to find that here. The lavender smell is strong and has taken some getting used to. If you are going to have an odor I guess this is okay. I know that lavender can have health benefits if used in its essential form and for specific needs but I am not sure what the purpose here is except to make the product have a pleasant odor. The company could probably save some money by using about 1/2 the amount.</li>
    <li> Consistency of the soap is very watery and goes everywhere when dispensing unless done so very carefully. Doesn&#x27;t create a much of a lather unless you use a lot of it, which is probably the case with many all-natural soaps.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim after reading several of the other product reviews. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will continue to use it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is subtle and not over-powering. It suds lightly, unlike those cheap brands you would find at your local store. I have dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out after usage. A little bit goes a long way as well, so I feel that this will last for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve tried hand soaps twice as expensive and I&#x27;m more satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot. It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Naturally cleans very nice scent</li>
    <li> Have been using this product and am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Do hope it has some sort of seal to protect the product.</li>
    <li> I loved this soap. I was looking for a natural product which wouldn&#x27;t dry out  my hands&#x27; skin and it looks like I found one. The smell is extremely nice.&lt;br /&gt;Price is pretty high though.</li>
    <li> Great soap, good price. Thank you Puracy for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great lather and scent. I have extremely sensitive skin and my hands feel clean but not irritated.</li>
    <li> Feel good after washing hands, skin feels soft and no irritation.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap.  I take this as an alternative to the triclosan soap used in my workplace.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent and short list of friendly and safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with all Puracy products in general.  I was having issues with my skin because of chemicals.  My skin was drying out and even to the point of cracking in a couple places.  I am a stay at home mom of three and I have to wash my hands often. So changing the soap was a priority since it was totally affecting my skin on my hands. Ever since I have tried this soap, my skin has mostly changed back to normal.  I will stick with this brand! So I am comfortable using any and all products in the Puracy line!</li>
    <li> This is the most awful smelling soap. I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> All natural is always great when it comes to having kids in the house. The smell is very subtle to me which is nice. Only bad thing is that I wish it didn&#x27;t cost quite as much.</li>
    <li> I needed a liquid soap for our soap dispenser in the kitchen. My husband and I have sensitive skin, and frequently find hand soaps drying even when they say moisturizing. So far Puracy has been great! No problem with dry skin and my hands feels soft.  The soap feels great on my hands and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I really like how gentle the soap is but lathers well. The lavender fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering. The only issue I had was due to packaging. When I took the cap off to remove the seal, the seal had already come off and was stuck in the cap. I&#x27;m sure the product was fine otherwise, but usually those seals stick on bottles more tightly, as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> Great find for a natural hand soap.  Exactly as described in the listing with fast shipping.  I plan to try other products in their line.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite soap.  We have multi generations living in our home and everyone loves the soap.</li>
    <li> Well, what is not, after all is said and done, &amp;#34;not natural&amp;#34;? Every toxic chemical man creates comes from the Earth. Benzisothiazolinone is toxic to the human immune system. Why is it in this hand soap? The Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate is plenty to preserve hand soap for a quarter of a century. Seriously, Citric Acid is enough to preserve a soap product. This company obviously has people writing fake reviews for them. &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34;. YES. It is. Land of toxic chemicals. Make your own hand soap. There are so many easy recipes online. Or stick with Bronner&#x27;s. Bottom line: don&#x27;t believe everything you read and do a bit of research if you are truly interested in your health, your children&#x27;s health, and the environment we seem hell-bent on destroying. Shame on you, &amp;#34;Puracy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Went off the reviews of everyone else as I was trying to find a nice, more natural hand soap for my bathroom as I now have dispensers mounted.  I haven&#x27;t been impressed with this soap so far.  It seemed very watered down and the scent was not a smell that I would expect from a lavender and vanilla. I&#x27;m not all that sensitive to smells and I&#x27;ve always found lavender and vanilla very plesant.  Neither one of the smells seemed apparent in the soap.  Cleaning of product was so so but I have really put it to work yet.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re in Austin - how cool.  I&#x27;m in Canyon Lake and a native Texan.  So the fact that you are in &amp;#34;the neighborhood&amp;#34; and in Texas is already 4 stars!.  The product is great, scent perfect, not too strong, not too faint.  The ingredients are such that my hands don&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; as much as with other hand soaps. I wash my hands VERY often.  I especially like the consistency,  thick rather than thin and watery.  This is my second order of this hand soap and I can&#x27;t see any reason to change in the future.  Yes, I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and will continue to recommend. I&#x27;m glad I found your product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap!  I was looking for a hand soap that I could use often and not have it dry out my hands (i.e. in the kitchen).  It also needed to contain ingredients I could tolerate and not cause an allergic reaction as did my previous soap.  I really think this is the one.  I have been using it for over a month and am very satisfied.  It does&#x27;t take much to effectively clean your hands.  I plan to use this throughout the house!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, cleans just as well. Not harsh or overpowering. I use the concentrated laundry soap as well - Puracy makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> If I could give 10 stars for service I would. Our first order worked very well for relieving my son&#x27;s dry hands. When I ordered a refill bottle it was all cloudy and bubbly looking when it arrived, not at all like the nice amber liquid of the first bottle. I sent a picture to customer service and Sean, a co-founder, got back to me right away. He apologized and explained that they had had this problem with a few bottles during shipping and that they were addressing it. He offered me a refund or replacement but assured me that the product was safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to go ahead and use it and aside from appearance it has been fine. Placing an order for more today. But the really remarkable part is that Sean actually followed up with me a couple weeks after our initial conversation just to see how it was working out and if there was anything more he could do to help. Now THAT is great customer service and will earn my loyalty every time. Way to go Puracy and Sean!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this soap. I really dislike soaps that are over scented and this one is not. It has a nice pleasant smell and works well on dirt.</li>
    <li> Great soap! Hands feel and smell clean after use. I ordered refills after using it for two days. Buy it you will like it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00OBRIVSQ Natural Liquid Hand Soap Refill, All Natural, Plant-Based, Non-Toxic, Lavender &amp; Vanilla - 25 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy liquid hand soap has a faint Lavender and Vanilla when first purchased which seems to diminish over time. We have been using the soap for over three months and have ordered refills. The soap in the refill bottles become cloudy and separate over time losing the appeal of a the golden liquid soap you see in the image. I could understand purchasing one bad batch, but it has happened with three refill bottles. Shaking the bottles to redistribute the contents does not help.</li>
    <li> cleans my hands without drying them out and scent is mild, comes in a nice big bottle for me to refill my old French lavender hand soap pump (La Maison). The smell is more chemical than the french lavender but only if you really stop and and smell the bottle or put your hand to your face and think about it, and I just did not want to buy another small plastic bottle every time I needed more hand soap.</li>
    <li> Very nice natural soap that is also like donating because the company helps less fortunate</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling soap, it suds up nicely and rinses easily. Re-ordered and will probably re-order again.</li>
    <li> Perfect liquid hand soap, especially for those with very dry skin. Smells wonderful, but not overpowering. The ingredients are all natural and, best of all, untested on animals, which is a bonus. And the bottles were shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Soaps works great for us.  I wanted a natural alternative for our family and have been happy with Puracy.  The scent is great and the soap cleans very well.  I also like it because we are on Septic and rather not put extra junk into the system.  I just wish they sold the refill by the gallon for I&#x27;m always ordering a couple of these refills at a time.</li>
    <li> Will be buying again.  It is a thinner consistency than big brand soaps, as noted by others, yet lathers and cleans very well without any irritation or the nasty chemicals often found in other soaps.  Maybe the lack of extra thickeners is what helps it rinse off so well.  I&#x27;ve used many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands of hand soap over the last few years and enjoy this one.  I&#x27;m hoping they will add other scents.</li>
    <li> I have a newborn in the house and I&#x27;m washing my hands and asking the rest of the family to do it frequently, I love the smell and consistency of this hand soap and it does not dry my hands, I say its a keeper!</li>
    <li> The soap has a really good consistency and cleans well.  It has a pretty strong scent and can leave my hands dry, but otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> This hand soap refill is great. I love that it&#x27;s natural and made in the USA. I fill the soap dispensers at all my sinks in the house with this. It&#x27;s nice that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and texture of this hand soap and the fragrancy is not overwhelming but very pleasant. I can&#x27;t wait for my wife to try it since she is very picky about hand and bath soaps. If she loves it we will use forever.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  I love all the Puracy products I have tried and continue to purchase each one as a result.</li>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve used yet.  It rids your hands of dirt and odor, it creates soft skin and smells terrific. I am hooked. I sent some to all my family members. Thank you Puracy for a great product.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product.  I&#x27;ve used DHC Skincare Olive soap (http://www.dhccare.com/olive-soap) for many years but wanted a good alternative for liquid hand soap.  I love the all-natural benefits of your product, but I am unfortunately really put off by the scent.  It is very strong, and smells more like a musky, spicy sandalwood than lavender and vanilla (I don&#x27;t get either of those scents with this soap).  I find it offensive to the point where I may discard it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is my primary problem, but I&#x27;m also not crazy about the unattractive color.  I thought it would be much clearer (it&#x27;s much darker and opaque than the picture here).  I use a clear dispenser, and the soap looks really unappealing in it.&lt;br /&gt;When I think of all natural products, I think &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;refreshing,&amp;#34; and this soap feels heavy and fortified.</li>
    <li> so far, so good. Love the smell and suds. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this soap- natural, smells good and non-drying. Does not clog the dispenser like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I received this product promptly and find it very effective, healthy, smells great and I shall look for their other products additionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently am allergic to topical products but this product has caused absolutely no itching or problems.</li>
    <li> Well worth it for a (more) natural product</li>
    <li> Cleans very well, moisturizes my skin, yet leaves no residue of any type.  Great product.</li>
    <li> If I had realized how much cheaper this was than the individual bottles, I would&#x27;ve been buying this from the get go! Love the scent and consistency. Not too thick. Not too funny. And it doesn&#x27;t clog the spout. The whole family loves it (which is rare).</li>
    <li> Puracy is very kind to my hands!  No more cracked thumbs! Other soaps I have used are harsh and irritate my skin.  Nice smelling and the pump is reliable without waste!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I had a problem with exzema on my hands this winter and my daughter said I should use a soap without any of the bad chemicals in it.  I found Puracy and decided to try it.  I ordered 4 bottles and have just ordered a refill.  I love it and my hands love it!  The lavender and vanilla scent is just right..not too strong.  It is also important to me that they do no testing on animals.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This 100% natural liquid hand soap by Puracy is a great all natural soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains no phosphates, chlorine, ammonia, or dyes of any kind. Instead, it uses plant and sugar based ingredients which surprisingly are very effective at cleaning your hands without harming your skin. It cuts through grease and grime very well and is comparable to some of the top brands that aren&#x27;t as gentle on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an interesting decision on Puracy&#x27;s part when it comes to the fragrance, typically lavender is used for soothing/calming in lotions but they decided to throw a little bit into some hand soap. At first I wasn&#x27;t sold on the idea but I have a habit of washing my hands as soon as I come home from work (I don&#x27;t get home until 9-930pm) and I have come to enjoy the scent very much. I am a huge lavender fan, I use lavender oil nightly in my diffuser which is bed side so this made perfect sense once I really thought about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are paying a premium for Puracy&#x27;s product line, there is no doubt about that however it really is quality product. This is more of a &amp;#34;Whole Foods&amp;#34; type product not something you&#x27;d typically find at Walmart or stores like that. You do get what you pay for when it comes to the Puracy line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review purposes.</li>
    <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used! I never leave reviews... But I had to for this. Great smell, great ingrediants, wonderful lather.</li>
    <li> Great scent, mixes well with water to use in foaming dispensers.</li>
    <li> Love the product, though I wish the product was larger, given it is a refill.</li>
    <li> It works well in the soap dispenser (not too thick where it clogs) but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand soap.It leaves my hands so soft and it has a nice scent</li>
    <li> After researching online, I decided to buy Puracy&#x27;s Natural Liquid Hand Soap because some of my family members (including myself) have been having allergic reactions to so many hand soaps! We&#x27;ve had burning sensation, chapped, cracked skin on our knuckles and top of our hands. This product is very gentle compared to many of the other &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; products out there. I have not experienced any burning, or cracked skin after using this product. It smells very clean, although it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; or other kind of artificial scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Lavender &amp; Vanilla scent, and it&#x27;s a natural, clean scent that I quickly got used to after the 1st day. Please don&#x27;t be discouraged when I say I had to &amp;#34;get used to it&amp;#34;.  Its smells good! I just feel that in a world of artificially scented EVERYTHING, most of the time, natural scents get ranked 2nd. I will definitely buy this again. :)</li>
    <li> This is a superior, environment friendly product.  It is a household staple.  Cleans flawlessly and leaves your hands soft (not dried out) and smelling great.  It&#x27;s a little bit more costly than other products you can get, and I&#x27;m tight with a buck.  This stuff is worth it, and I don&#x27;t say that very often!!!</li>
    <li> Love the earthy, sweet smell. Feels lovely when sudsing and leaves the moisture in my skin. Will buy again and totally recommend! Tempted to try as a body wash too.</li>
    <li> This is the second Puracy product I&#x27;ve tried and loved (first was the laundry stain remover). I&#x27;m an avid hand-washer and was in desperate need of a hand soap that didn&#x27;t dry my skin, and Puracy&#x27;s hand soap is perfectly gentle on my hands and has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feel. I&#x27;m replacing all the hand soaps in my house with this one and I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap!  I have been looking for a soap that didn&#x27;t dry my skin and here it is!  I would give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> Best hand soap I&#x27;ve found and it&#x27;s priced half as much as what I was buying before.  The scent is nice and not overpowering  Makes just enough suds and rinses clean.  Not drying.</li>
    <li> My initial switch to Puracy and the hand soap. I am not disappointed. It works well and has a nice smooth smell. It does not dry out my hands and has a decent lather. I like the ingredients in many of the Puracy products. I would recommend and will buy from Puracy again.</li>
    <li> feel safe using this..I originally bought household pkg..but needed more hand soap. I use every product now.</li>
    <li> Texture and fragrance are mediocre. Soap content marginal.</li>
    <li> I have to use two pumps to get my hands clean.  It is an O.K. soap and i like it but not as much as Nature&#x27;s Gate hand soap.</li>
    <li> soap is to thin drips off hands, got to be quick, seems to work like soap i believe it is somewhat mild. G</li>
    <li> This is very good soap with a heavenly smell!  We are very pleased we purchased this all natural product!</li>
    <li> This hand soap is a new favorite for me. It smells divine, leaves my skin soft and is made with natural ingredients. It may be a little pricey but I don&#x27;t really mind considering the high quality. Will be purchasing this again soon.</li>
    <li> I look for products that are plant based and that don&#x27;t test on animals.  That alone would make Puracy a good choice for me, but besides those crucial requirements that it has met, it is just a very nice soap.  I love the scent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, the active ingredients are coconut based. I like the smell, it&#x27;s subtle - not strong like chemical fragrances. I only need 3 or 4 drops to get a nice lather.  Haven&#x27;t got any rave reviews from the others people using it... I&#x27;ll keep it in mind when ordering again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, foams well, no toxic chemicals &#x3D; recommended.</li>
    <li> Great natural hand soap.  Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Big drawback for me... I&#x27;m allergic to this product probably from the scent. Scent too strong and manly to suit me. Hand soap does not foam, but is smooth.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product knowing it was a natural product. I had read all the reviews and many expressed that it was moisturizing which was what I was looking for as I really dislike the dry feeling many hand soaps give. Sadly, in my experience with this product, the promise to &amp;#34; moisturize and balance your skin&amp;#34; did not happen for me. My hands still felt dry and in need of lotion after use. For what it is worth, we use well water that is softened.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product.  Smells better and lathers better than other lavender soaps.</li>
    <li> Love it, smells great! Hands feel clean and love what company is doing.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a great, all natural product, plant based with no unnecessary additives. Equally as important, this product is made in the USA, and a portion of the proceeds are donated to charity. All around a great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
