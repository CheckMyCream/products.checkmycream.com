      <li>It has a strong scent.</li>
      <li>This has a very good smell and lasts a long time, will be buying again.</li>
      <li>However, I can tell you that this product has a very nice clean herbal scent that is unmistakably masculine.  </li>
      <li>This is some great body wash from soapmaker Irish Spring.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This is a good-sized bottle of their body wash, and it&#x27;s cheap and does the job.</li>
      <li>Very Good Soap, I love Irish Spring, What i also love about this body wash, That it has vitamins and neutralizers that help your skin, especially if you don&#x27;t use lotion all the time.</li>
      <li>That is reserved for the original body wash</li>
      <li>not the good smelling irish spring</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m a man that&#x27;s cool.  </li>
      <li>He just pours it on his cloth as much as he wants to use and it suds better than the soap</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got this one on subscribe and save to make sure I have a steady supply.  </li>
      <li>They said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s body wash and there&#x27;s not much to say about body wash.&amp;#34; However, after drilling them, I got them to admit that it smells good,</li>
      <li>Cleaning up soap from tile is fun.</li>
      <li>The same great smell, the clean feeling, and while it&#x27;s not much of an exfoliator, it&#x27;ll certainly make you smell good all day long.</li>
      <li>lathers well, has a good texture, is a nice color (green) and left their skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Irish Spring for years - their soap bar always smelled good, was affordable, and as far as I know did the trick.</li>
      <li>Is it the exact Irish Spring scent that we all have come to love?</li>
      <li>It also keep his skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>He resisted at first, but now he loves it.  </li>
      <li>Nice and thick (a lot of body washes are watered down a bit too much) and has a great fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Irish Spring has always smelled good and this body wash lives up to that standard.</li>
      <li>, that doesn&#x27;t last as long nor leaves your skin feeling as good as this one does.</li>
      <li>This body wash works fantastic, smells better when on your skin then in the bottle, and truly does last a LONG time.</li>
      <li>This means that I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot at a time.  </li>
      <li>While this has \\&quot;24-hour odor reducing technology\\&quot; that the Irish Spring bar soap does not have and retains more of the skin&#x27;s natural hydration\\</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Irish Spring, however.</li>
      <li>Read the label people, it isn&#x27;t supposed to be the original Irish Spring.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t normally pay much attention to that - did I mention I&#x27;m a man?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got all the classic feels.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Gear&amp;#34; Body Wash seems to have taken that classic style and reduced it into the gel and hydrating form.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a particularly foamy soap, if that&#x27;s important to you.  </li>
      <li>I like Irish Spring bar soap very much, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, it washed off somewhat easily and a few minutes after it had dried completely, my skin was in fact softer.  </li>
      <li>far, it is a win-win for both my husband and myself.</li>
      <li>My 16 &amp; 17 year old sons used this body wash.</li>
      <li>If you use a shower puff it could get a little thin quickly, making you have to use a liberal amount every time, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>My husband has recently started using Irish Spring body washes, and we both really like them.  </li>
      <li>As far as its hydrating properties I&#x27;d say that I did not notice particularly dry skin while using it</li>
      <li>But I still didn&#x27;t care for the scent, and there seemed to be far too many unnecessary (and potentially unsafe) ingredients, including sodium hydroxide, which is lye, that I don&#x27;t care to wash with along with all of the other chemicals and dyes in this product on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather well. The Irish Spring smell is faint. Not worth the trip.</li>
    <li> not the good smelling irish spring i remember</li>
    <li> My teen uses these instead of soap.  It also keep his skin soft and smooth.  Price was great.</li>
    <li> Great deodorizing soap. Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Irish Spring, however. It has a strong scent.</li>
    <li> I like Irish Spring bar soap very much, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It&#x27;s nothing like the bar soap.  While this has \\&quot;24-hour odor reducing technology\\&quot; that the Irish Spring bar soap does not have and retains more of the skin&#x27;s natural hydration\\&quot; (according to the label), I was not impressed with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on your skin almost like a cream with virtually no lather, which along with the scent,  I did not find either particularly pleasant.  Fortunately, it washed off somewhat easily and a few minutes after it had dried completely, my skin was in fact softer.

    <li> This is some great body wash from soapmaker Irish Spring.&lt;br /&gt;This great body was, that leaves my body clean and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this great body wash in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended!</li>
    <li> Great smell-- leaves skin clean &amp; refreshed.  The indented sides of the bottle make it easier to grip in the shower :)</li>
    <li> Of course, scent is objective.  However, I can tell you that this product has a very nice clean herbal scent that is unmistakably masculine.  Of the many body washes I have tried, this one by far lathers the best.  This means that I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot at a time.  I&#x27;ve got this one on subscribe and save to make sure I have a steady supply.  I will be using it for years to come.  (I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!)</li>
    <li> love the way my husband smells after using this. I like the way it smells anyways and it lives up to what it says.</li>
    <li> My husband has recently started using Irish Spring body washes, and we both really like them.  This one has a nice and light scent, lathers up really easily and washes off my skin cleanly, so I don&#x27;t feel like there is any leftover clinging to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Irish Spring version is multi-purpose - you can use it on your hair and body.  It also contains Vitamin E, which is great for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it is a win-win for both my husband and myself.</li>
    <li> Needs a better top or tape on it - got all over everything in the box and leaked out the bottom onto the floor.  Cleaning up soap from tile is fun. {sarcasm}</li>
    <li> I ordered and the bottle was destroyed. Just went to return item page but unable to send back destroyed gooey plastic item.</li>
    <li> The price was awesome to beat and the smell was extremely good and in no way did i feel less refreshed compared to my more pricey neutrogena body-wash. The only issue is this being offered as an add-on item forcing me to place minimum order size which is always not the case and so had to shift to costco</li>
    <li> I recomend this product so nice and leaves a great lasting smell on you all day</li>
    <li> Smells good and scent lasts a good portion of the day.</li>
    <li> How can you not like the smell of Irish Spring? This is a good-sized bottle of their body wash, and it&#x27;s cheap and does the job. If you use a shower puff it could get a little thin quickly, making you have to use a liberal amount every time, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Is it the exact Irish Spring scent that we all have come to love? No, it isn&#x27;t. That is reserved for the original body wash, that doesn&#x27;t last as long nor leaves your skin feeling as good as this one does. Read the label people, it isn&#x27;t supposed to be the original Irish Spring. This body wash works fantastic, smells better when on your skin then in the bottle, and truly does last a LONG time. 24 hours long? Probably not on my smelly body, but either way I am a big fan of this body wash. It definitely holds up to the Irish Spring label, and I suggest it for anyone looking for a change in body wash.</li>
    <li> Very Good Soap, I love Irish Spring, What i also love about this body wash, That it has vitamins and neutralizers that help your skin, especially if you don&#x27;t use lotion all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this entire bottle of Irish Springs Gear Body Wash.  It&#x27;s a decent smelling soap and a little on the manly side.  Since I&#x27;m a man that&#x27;s cool.  It&#x27;s not a particularly foamy soap, if that&#x27;s important to you.  As far as its hydrating properties I&#x27;d say that I did not notice particularly dry skin while using it but I don&#x27;t normally pay much attention to that - did I mention I&#x27;m a man?  However, I&#x27;ve got no problem with this product and would use it again.  It does its job of cleaning and making you smell nice well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Irish Spring for years - their soap bar always smelled good, was affordable, and as far as I know did the trick. The &amp;#34;Gear&amp;#34; Body Wash seems to have taken that classic style and reduced it into the gel and hydrating form. It&#x27;s got all the classic feels. The same great smell, the clean feeling, and while it&#x27;s not much of an exfoliator, it&#x27;ll certainly make you smell good all day long. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Irish Spring has always smelled good and this body wash lives up to that standard. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave any filmy residue. I would definitely buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> My 16 &amp; 17 year old sons used this body wash. They said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s body wash and there&#x27;s not much to say about body wash.&amp;#34; However, after drilling them, I got them to admit that it smells good, lathers well, has a good texture, is a nice color (green) and left their skin moisturized. They had no cons concerning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is designed to have a good grip while in the shower. I&#x27;m happy with the product and so are my boys.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the soap, but I was tired of cleaning soap out of the tub and convinced him to try the body wash.  He resisted at first, but now he loves it.  It smells just like the soap, but is more convenient.  He just pours it on his cloth as much as he wants to use and it suds better than the soap so he says it cleans better.  Also more convenient for him to travel with so that he do not have to use the hotel soaps.</li>
    <li> works great thanks . when i come out of the shower smells wonderful .</li>
    <li> Nice and thick (a lot of body washes are watered down a bit too much) and has a great fresh smell. So far, this is the best body wash I have tried. I still like to out different ones now and then, which is how I came across this. I don&#x27;t like the exfoliating one, though because of the little beads or whatever they are.</li>
    <li> This has a very good smell and lasts a long time, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Used it once feels great smells great</li>
    <li> good price for good wash</li>
</ol>
