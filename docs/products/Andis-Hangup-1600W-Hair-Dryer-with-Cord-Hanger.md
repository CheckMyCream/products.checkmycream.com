      <li>TWO OF OUR FRIENDS LIKED THEM</li>
      <li>Hook for cord is a nice plus</li>
      <li>Nice to have a hook to hold the cable.</li>
      <li>this is an excellent blow dryer, it has a lot of power, but the pieces to hang it with are very flimsy.</li>
      <li>Always liked the wall-mounted hairdryers in motels &amp; resorts.  </li>
      <li>Fits a need, but not as nicely made as the model it replaced.</li>
      <li>This product was easy to install, solves storage problems &amp; does a good job w/2 drying speeds.  </li>
      <li>I have tried these type of hairdryers before, while on cruises, and have always liked them, but this is, by far, the best one I have ever used...</li>
      <li>and it is just right!!!  </li>
      <li>I urge Amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the Amazon purchase record provides &amp;#34;proof of purchase&amp;#34; they needed to honor their own 1-year warranty.  </li>
      <li>it would be nice if it could be adjusted more than two settings</li>

      <li>This is a nice dryer and perfect for my short hair!</li>

      <li>super cool/ industrial without the cover and is good quality.  </li>

      <li>I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below.  </li>
      <li>I love the cord hanger because it looks better.  </li>

      <li>(I let mine air-dry--my hair looks more like Michael Bolton&#x27;s--or Fabio&#x27;s--</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Overall the best I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
      <li>I had to get better anchors to hold the mount on the wall.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m glad to get this off my counter</li>
      <li>Have used it for over two months now and love it.  </li>
      <li>Also I really love the fact that it easily disconnects to become a travel dryer.  </li>
      <li>I thought more of it than she did (primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter,</li>
      <li>Better than expected and great price!</li>
      <li>It sure is handy to have the blow dryer right there on the wall when you need it.  </li>
      <li>we know the handy hanger will be useful when the coil cord loosens up with use.</li>
      <li>Seems like someone really cared about making this a good</li>
      <li>But my wife loved it so much (when it did work) that we purchased another one.  </li>
      <li>Very powerful and the wall mount makes it very accessible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing special but good enough for the price.  I&#x27;d like to see a cool setting on it, and I don&#x27;t find it to be the strongest amount of air flow, but it does the job and keeps the dryer and cord off the counter.</li>
    <li> Went to a Marriott hotel in Hawaii that had this model, and loved how convenient it was, so we purchased two. They look great, the cord stays out of the way, and they even come with sticky tape if you want/need to mount them to a mirror like I did. Very good buy.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The chord is long enough. Noise level is not too loud. Two power levels. The only reason I only gave it three stars is because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer for my camper.  It is perfect.  It&#x27;s compact, hangs on the wall, not loud and does the job.  I would recommend this product for campers, boats, etc.  I will buy another when I burn this one out.  A girl&#x27;s hair still has to look good, even when you&#x27;re camping!</li>
    <li> A very ordinary, even mediocre hair dryer. Too small, which was hard to tell from it picture online. And its VERY loud. Sounds like a shrill airplane taking off. My daughter hates it and wants to cover her ears when I use it on her hair, even on the lower speed setting. Of course being a hair dryer it has to be used around the ears so... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it, and suggest you turn on a bunch of hair dryers in person before buying it online. BTW, it dries just fine and blows air quite far.</li>
    <li> Very convenient. Love it. Hve it in every bathroom</li>
    <li> The on/off switch is in an awkward place so as you dry your hair you tend to turn off the hairdryer by accident.</li>
    <li> Very cheap! Not much blowing power and very little heat. I can not recommend this product. I forgot to mention it is also VERY NOISY! Spend a little more money and get you a good one.   David/Ohio</li>
    <li> Easy to install, easy to use. The noise, some people complain about, comes with the size; how do you expect to blow 1600W through such small opening. It suits my needs. I&#x27;m giving 4 just because it&#x27;s too early to make any conclusions regarding quality.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and the wall mount makes it very accessible. I like the cord hang-up feature. The mounting screws &amp; mollies could be a little more substantial. Overall the best I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
    <li> The dryer was great for about 3 weeks.  It was easy to install and had tons of power.  It dried my hair faster than my old dryer and was extremely light weight, however, it DIED!  I was drying my hair and it looked like something was on fire inside and about 30 seconds later it shot a streak of fire out and quit.  The heat source still works but the motor won&#x27;t.  I am really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> WE USED THIS HAIR DRYER IN A HOTEL ONCE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH WE HAVE ONE IN EVER BATHROOM (7) IN THE HOUSE...  WE LIVE AT THE BEACH SO WHEN WE HAVE COMPANY THEY USE THE HAIR DRYERS AND THEY LOVE THEM..  TWO OF OUR FRIENDS LIKED THEM SO MUCH THEY BOUGHT ONE FOR THEIR HOUSES.......  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THE HAIR DRYER WITH THE NIGHT LIGHT, THE LIGHT WON&#x27;T LAST LONG, JUST BUY THIS ONE IT&#x27;S THE BEST........</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! Lasted 1 Week!- Gets Hot and Quits in less then 3 minutes- needs to cool off then will work for another 3 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Aggravating and not worth  the time to order this product.</li>
    <li> These work great for motor homes and any close bathroom location.</li>
    <li> It works as it should be working</li>
    <li> I have tried these type of hairdryers before, while on cruises, and have always liked them, but this is, by far, the best one I have ever used...not only is it small and compact, it actually dries your hair pretty quickly!</li>
    <li> Got two years of daily use from 2 users.</li>
    <li> Not a good purchase. My unit shuts off when run on high setting after a couple of minutes.  Nothing is obstructing the flow.  Thie other setting (low) manages to stay on but dries your hair to a crisp.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent blow dryer, it has a lot of power, but the pieces to hang it with are very flimsy. it would be much better if it came with something else to make it a little sturdier.</li>
    <li> Great in my bath.  Couple of screws and on the wall it is.  Works great and keeps the cord off my counter.</li>
    <li> As I had minimal space on our bathroom  counter I needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way.  I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below.  Thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed.  As far as the function of the dryer, it lives up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> Always liked the wall-mounted hairdryers in motels &amp; resorts.  This product was easy to install, solves storage problems &amp; does a good job w/2 drying speeds.  Also like the cord hanger feature.</li>
    <li> Fits a need, but not as nicely made as the model it replaced. The base is all molded plastic and is not really integrated with the hair dryer. What I mean is that there are two notches cut in to the plastic base and the hair dryer cord is run through the notches with some rubber grommets used to hold the cord in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not a lot of alternative products to choose from and on the plus side it was relatively cheap and easy to install.</li>
    <li> Appears well made, has a good fan speed and heats up well for a compact dryer.  Nice to have a hook to hold the cable.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer does exactly what it promises: dries hair fast and keeps the dryer handy but neatly out of the way--all for under $25! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the noise it creates. I wanted to buy the *quiet* version, but couldn&#x27;t find it available anywhere.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  It is so easy to use in my bathroom because it is available yet out of the way.  It is a nice size and plenty of power.</li>
    <li> This Andis 30970, was a wonderful purchase.  Good size, good heat temperature, easy to install and the cord hanger goes on either the right or left side.  I have had other wall mounted dryers, they were hard to hang, the Andis was up in a matter of minutes.</li>
    <li> Works well for the money invested. Simple, two-speed rocker switch is adequate for most applications. Holder is very secure (easy to take dryer out and to put back). Cord hanger is a nice touch, especially if unit is mounted where the cord might dangle onto counter, into sink, etc. Moderate noise level, typical for this size of device.</li>
    <li> Works great! Hook for cord is a nice plus</li>
    <li> We have owned two of these hair dryers and each of them functioned for just over a year (coincidentally, a few months past the return window).  We loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall, are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized.  However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.  There are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions.  We won&#x27;t be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn&#x27;t as hazardous.</li>
    <li> Fits the bill perfectly. I sought a small, efficient hair dryer that could hang up in my very small bathroom and be unobtrusive but effective.  The cord - hanger is a plus, allows the coiled cord to be placed out of the way.  I disagree with some reviewers who found it very noisy on high setting. This dryer is just fine.</li>
    <li> The mounting screws and anchors did not hold.  I had to get better anchors to hold the mount on the wall.  It&#x27;s a little loud, but seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> noisy but works great</li>
    <li> Small and easy to use. So easy to just grab and use, without having to pull out, plug in and then roll of cord and put away.</li>
    <li> quite working in 3 months</li>
    <li> Bought one for our winter home also because its a great space saver and its extremely convenient to have it right at your fingertips.  Very powerful for a little dryer.</li>
    <li> This is so much more convenient than dragging a dryer from a drawer or cabinet.  Hotels have had the right idea all along.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product.  I bought one several years ago  for our camper and have been very satisfied with how it works.  When my older model gave out I ordered another Andis.</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s small but does the job. I have it in the guest bathroom, and everyone wants to know where I got it. I use it regularly and love the cord hanger it comes with.</li>
    <li> This thing is way to small to be useful. If it were a portable, perhaps, but this is a wall mount! It&#x27;s like a mini hand dryer. Returned it immediately after receiving it.</li>
    <li> Over 20 years ago I bought an andis handup hairdryer.  I have loved it and used it everyday.  It started making noises, so I ordered another one.  I think I paid less for this than the one I bought so long ago.  I like the extra hook so the cord can be hung up.  It even fit the holes in the wall.  May this one last as long.  Great price great delivery as promised.</li>
    <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  It is small but it is mighty.  Arrived quickly.  Would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Mounted both items in the master bathroom. I&#x27;m completely satiefied with them. Strong air flow,nice cord length and easy instalation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new Andis hangup hair dryer; it is exceptionally efficient and easy to install/mount in the bathroom.  I use this every time I wash my hair and it is just right!!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> overheats very quickly, so not useful at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair.  I couldn&#x27;t dry more than 1/4 of it without it stopping.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer finally died (good riddance) so i decided to spring for this bad boy.  I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  Here&#x27;s what I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good power.  I blow dry every morning and use heavy gel so I need something with punch-- this does the trick. My previous was an 1875W (more power) but I don&#x27;t feel like this guy is lacking at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not too loud.  My old dryer was like revving a harley... obnoxious.  This one still makes a good amount of noise-- but way quieter than my 1875W.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good engineering touches.  I was surprised to see what nice features they had included-- the mounting template was spot-on, and there is an internal area to stow away excess power cord length.  The curly cord holder can be mounted on either side, which was VERY useful with my limited mounting options.  Seems like someone really cared about making this a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wall mount works well.  The blower fits solidly to the wall mount, like closing the door of a mercedes benz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good value.  Given the fit and finish, the nice engineering touches, the power, the nice cord... hard to believe it&#x27;s so cheap.  Even the plastic is slick and shiny and seems more expensive than what I&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Strange wall mounting sleeve.  The included plastic screw mounting sleeves are not tapered, they are the same diameter-- so getting them into a wall is a very odd experience (and they slipped through the drywall completely when I tried it).  Maybe i&#x27;m dense but i used conventional sleeves which worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;- Handset back cover fell off.  The round part that covers the intake fell off... but to be honest the exposed black mesh intake looks super cool/ industrial without the cover and is good quality.  I think the airflow will be better without the cover anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  A great bargain and i&#x27;m glad to get this off my counter save some space!</li>
    <li> This is a neat little hair dryer that has alot of power and does not take up much space. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Bought for our motor home. Installed easily and works great.  It is small enough to be out of the way yet has the power needed.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Our camper has a small bathroom. I needed a hairdryer that was always up and out of the way.  This one is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this...just purchased our 2nd one.  Bought one originally for our guest bath to keep the cabinets &amp; countertop clutter free and liked it so much, got one for our bathroom.  Powerful and compact.  Received in 2 days as promised.</li>
    <li> Loved it for 8 months, then today in the middle of drying my hair smelled electrical burning smell.  Couldn&#x27;t turn it off,had to unplug it. No problems until today,but will try new brand this time.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Fits in a small space.  Very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Love the small but powerful size. Used virtually daily for 5 years and just wore out. I immediately ordered an identical replacement . No clutter on countertop, cord hanger, just a great unit.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this hair dryer.  I love the cord hanger because it looks better.  Great price and easy installation.</li>
    <li> The first one burnt up the low setting within about 3 months.  But my wife loved it so much (when it did work) that we purchased another one.  And 3 months later, it burnt up the low setting on that one.  Junk.  Makes Amazon look bad when they market things like this.</li>
    <li> My experience with this hairdryer is nearly identical to that of a previous reviewer. It&#x27;s easy to install, and handy as all get out. However, almost on its one-year birthday, the low setting stopped working, and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard. The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can&#x27;t be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I&#x27;ve owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn&#x27;t quit for years and years. I&#x27;m disappointed--my first thought was to purchase another just like it, but since this appears to be a problem for others as well, I&#x27;ll look for another solution.</li>
    <li> Update: I purchased my latest replacement (yes, if you buy this product you will need to replace it regularly) on Jun 19, 2017 and now it has failed on July 27 (LOW speed stopped working so it only blows on HIGH). The product is wonderful when it works but my Amazon order history shows it is a consistent failure (purchases on Jan 3, 2012, Mar 5, 2013, May 20, 2013, Jun 19, 2017) of the same feature. There was at least one other failure but I complained directly to the manufacturer about the short lifespan in 2013 and was sent a new one and also bought another new one at a local store and these two lasted 4 years, 2013-2017.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may ask why I keep buying this product and I will say, 1) it is inexpensive, 2) a few of these units have lasted for more than one year, 3) the 3 holes on my bathroom wall where it is mounted are difficult to disguise and each replacement unit so far has fit into these holes (although I now use a slightly larger drywall anchor) and, 4) I like having a hair dryer off my counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original comment: I purchased this hair dryer more than a year ago and used it nearly every day to dry both my husband&#x27;s and my own short hair.  It is a reasonably quiet but powerful machine that does its job well.  The addition of a hanger on the wall mount to wrap the cord out of harms way, since it inevitably stretches out, is a great innovation.  I would have given it a 5-star review then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the lower speed (it has two speeds) stopped functioning after a little more than a year. The higher speed is too hot and too noisy to use.  I repurchased the exact same hair dryer on April 6, 2013.  Today--3 days AFTER the 30-day product replacement window--the lower speed stopped functioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/14/15:  The manufacturer replaced this hair dryer under their more customer-friendly policy but I had already bought a new one from Amazon so I stored it away.  Last week, more than two YEARS later, the new Amazon hair dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.  I urge Amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the Amazon purchase record provides &amp;#34;proof of purchase&amp;#34; they needed to honor their own 1-year warranty.  I also  am upgrading this product to 4 stars because it continued to perform well for longer than many inexpensive electrical appliances these days and, obviously, I like the style and functionality enough to keep buying the same unit&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase a third one.  I downgraded my review to 3 stars because, when functioning correctly, it is still a very decent hair dryer.  The company needs to work on their quality control issues.air dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.

    <li> For the price it is really great. I like this product..it would be nice if it could be adjusted more than two settings but it is very handy and dries hair very fast. (I suppose the more expensive one have more settings) It does get very hot. When your done it just pops back in the wall holder and the cord hangs up on the knob so it&#x27;s out of the way.</li>
    <li> Nice little unit but it will fry your body parts if you&#x27;re not careful.  Very powerful.</li>
    <li> Great!  Makes life so much easier in the morning.  Dries my hair quickly.  Simple mounting, even for me.  Plan to get two more.</li>
    <li> My wife and I first used one of these at a hotel.  We really like it and bought one to install in our master bathroom.  We use it daily and have had it about 3 years with no problems.  Cleaning the air intake every few months or sooner really increases the life of these type hairdryers and only takes a minute or less.  The power cord length and dryer cord length are just right for our use.  The power and air output is adequate for us too.  It is not over the top pwerful but adequate for us.</li>
    <li> When I read reviews, I am always looking for reports of how long the product lasted. When my Andis 30970 Hangup bit the dust today, I looked it up in my Amazon order history and discovered that I had ordered it exactly three years ago today, on October 21. So there you have it. I really liked this little dryer even if it was a little loud. It was handy and worked well.</li>
    <li> Better than expected and great price!</li>
    <li> After 2 months of use this product stop working, and when it does is some can of fire on the resistance. I want to return it or have a replacement but the 1 month warranty already expire...</li>
    <li> First bumped into this product while travelling. Marriott Hotels do a good job of equiping their Hotel Rooms with User-Friendly&lt;br /&gt;Appliances. This dryer is no exception. Its&#x27; small, compact, hangs easily net to our bathroom mirror. My wife raves about.&lt;br /&gt;Dryers usually burn out besause the user usually forgets to clean the lint screen in the back of the dryer. I have had this dryer for several years, cleaning it occassionally and its still going strong. There are several styles, check the model that best fits your&lt;br /&gt;needs.</li>
    <li> These are the second and third Andis hair dryers we have purchsed. The first we bought about 4 years ago. We recently moved and because is was attached to the wall it went with the house. This time we bought one for our master bath and one for the guest bath. We expected to the same great product and have not been disappointed. It has both a high and low setting, the cord is flexible and (from experience) we know the handy hanger will be useful when the coil cord loosens up with use.</li>
    <li> I used one of these dryers at a Marriott and thought it would be a great idea for my tiny bathroom that has little sink space or storage. For a small dryer it has great output and dries my hair quickly. Because of where my closet door frame is, I was pleased that you can actually put the cord hanger on either the right or left, because the left side worked far better for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer as I was moving and needed to leave my older one in the house I was moving from. I bought it in advance of the move and it stayed in the box. I have now opened it and hung it on the wall. After I turn it on it shuts itself off fron overheating in less than one minute. I am past the 30 days to return as I didn&#x27;t open and use it when I got it. It is a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t buy it. Now I am going to have to lose my money on this piece of crap and buy another one to replace it.</li>
    <li> Over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use. Returned to Amazon. Would in no way recommend</li>
    <li> One of those...saw one just like it in a motel while on vaca with my GF a few years back...I thought more of it than she did (primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter, the better).&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what she thought, too (that I bought this as a &#x27;message&#x27;)...which is why she&#x27;s used it maybe three times in four years since I installed it there for her.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great hair dryer (I let mine air-dry--my hair looks more like Michael Bolton&#x27;s--or Fabio&#x27;s--that way).&lt;br /&gt;This little dryer still works great (I guess, I turn it on every once in awhile to check).&lt;br /&gt;Yay, relationship issues!</li>
    <li> This is a nice dryer and perfect for my short hair!</li>
    <li> Have used it for over two months now and love it.  Easy to install and the cord stays neat on the hook.  Powerful enough to dry my short and in less than 3 minutes. My main reason for purchasing this was to find something I could hang-on the wall for easy access to use daily and to have it stored nicely in our main bathroom when not in use.</li>
    <li> It is compact, easily mounted and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the noise, it&#x27;s a great little dryer. Works fast at drying my long thick hair. Love the convenience of having it handy  and out of the way. Really like getting the cord up and out of the way, too.</li>
    <li> It sure is handy to have the blow dryer right there on the wall when you need it.  Also I really love the fact that it easily disconnects to become a travel dryer.  Only one thing that I don&#x27;t like and that is the noise level - a little too loud, also would like one more setting for a lower temp and lower speed.  I would still recommend it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small but has lots of power even on the lower speed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wall mount dryer similar to my sunbeam that I have had for years. This one was similar in size and has a few more features.  The cord storage is wonderful as is the extra wattage. The handle is more comfortable than my old one also. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product at three other facilities and it is a value for the cost. Mounts easily and works as detailed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten this hair dryer hung up on my wall yet, but I did test it out and I think it will be fine.  I like how small it is, and that it will be so easily accessed when it is on the wall.</li>
    <li> This design with the hook to hang the cord on is great, but the dryer itself only has two modes: &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Burn your scalp off Hot.&amp;#34;</li>
