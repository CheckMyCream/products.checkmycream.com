<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These products are NOT what you would get if you bought them from the salon! I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for over a year, so I am pretty familiar with these products. The shampoo I received is very gritty and appears to have small beads in it. The cream rinse feels about the same consistency, but it does not make my hair look and feel as it did when I had the actual products! BUYERS BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Loved the smell! However, it would leave my hair in knots during washing and would need lots of conditioner to detangle. I have thin medium length hair. After a wash and blow out my hair would have a nice shiny glow and smelled great.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for several years and like them very much.  Though the shampoo was of the same fine quality as when I purchase it from a salon, the cream rinse was not.  In fact, after using it twice, I went to my salon and purchased it. There is definitely  a difference in the consistency and quality between the rinse purchased at the salon and the one I purchased through Amazon. The nearly full container sits in my bathroom cabinet, as I been meaning to write to Amazon to complain about this product.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed,  the bottle of conditioner was only about 2/3 full.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo feels like it is actually conditioner.  I have never had shampoo that would not lather and it makes my hair super soft just like conditioner....only I DIDN&amp;#34;T WANT CONDITIONER yet....so then I have to wash my hair with different shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darn - because this stuff smells good, just feel like I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> Super delicious products. My hair is shiny and silky after use. Highly recommended. Great fir keratened hair. Freat smell.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is exactly what I expected but the conditioner was a disappointment.  It does not soften as it claims and leaves my hair feeling as if I did not add any conditioner at all. Definitely not the quality I was expecting from a $20 conditioner.  Will be returning product and reordering shampoo ONLY.  I will go back to using any other regular conditioner that will probably work 10x better than this one.</li>
    <li> Great product. Packaged with care and expedited quickly, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Conditioner is crap, not Paul Mitchell. I think the seller is high grading the conditioner and replacing it with cheap stuff. Go to a salon and buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Shampoo and Conditioner and I absolutely love it.  Leaves my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Guess I had high hopes for this product since it was recommended and sold at my hair salon.  I have course, unruly, wavy hair that frizzes in the summer humidity.  Shampoo lathers abundantly and the scent of both products is delicious.  I think as a whole package, I prefer the Keratin conditioner to the shampoo.  It&#x27;s smoothing properties after a shampoo is just what I need for my hair.  Had high expectations but don&#x27;t think they were met.  Just okay!</li>
    <li> Loved the shampoo. The conditioner, though, left my hair feeling like it had buildup in it :-(</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells so fresh And hair so silky and shiny!</li>
    <li> Love this Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger Moisturizing Shampoo and Keratin conditioner. If you color your hair, this product doesn&#x27;t wash your color out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for my fine, thin hair.  I can detangle easily and the perfume of the shampoo takes me to Hawaii!!</li>
    <li> Great products...Both the shampoo and conditioner last a long time.  Salon quality at a good price!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff &amp; have shared with family and friends who also love the smell and quality.</li>
    <li> I love these products.  Up until I found them I could only use other products 7-8 times before having to find another product because of the way my hair would react to prolonged use.  On the recommendation of a friend I started using  the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi products.  Only a little bit is needed to get a good lather with the shampoo.  A small portion for the conditioner as well.  My hair is never weighed down, has body and feels incredible.  I&#x27;m on my second bottles.  Love them</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and has really made a difference to the health of my hair. After a salon awapuhi treatment, I have been using this duo, and my hair, which was thin and totally limp, has regained shine, softness, and bounce. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Leaves my hair very silky smooth. I will purchase more!</li>
    <li> The hair products are excellent. Great for shine and manageability.Hair doesn&#x27;t dry out or get greasy in a short time.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was ok but the rinse was watered down.... Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great combination from jpm.  Works and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is counter-fit, very old, or watered down. My hair dresser used these products on my hair so I know what my hair is supposed to look like afterwards, and my hair looks nothing like that after using these products. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I typically love Paul Mitchell products but this one didn&#x27;t help my hair. I easily get dandruff and I thought the ginger would help. Unfortunately, the ginger did not. Maybe next product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff on my hair. Keeps hair nice and smells pretty.</li>
    <li> My favorite!!! Works amazing!</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product as salon but at a much more affordable price! Love it!</li>
    <li> very fast delivery, this product does work for any types of hair</li>
    <li> Yes Awapuhi is a great product, especially for all natural hair styles.  It gives your hair a beautiful natural shine.  It helps you style your hair in an instant.  Thanks Awapuhi!!!</li>
    <li> Love these products from Paul Mitchell.</li>
