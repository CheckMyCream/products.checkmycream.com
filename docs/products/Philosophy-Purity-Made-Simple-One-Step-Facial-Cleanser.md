      <li>Good smelling body creams and sprays are for the 1 star.</li>
      <li>I tried this facewash and fell in love!</li>
      <li>It is really the best for my aging skin.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought that nothing would work, and I was spending all this money on anything that deemed extraordinary..wasting money and taking my cabinet space..and making my skin look and feel worse.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The cleanser seemed nice, although the smell was neither pleasing nor repulsive, and it broke me out within about four uses.</li>
      <li>The CEO of Philosophy should quit playing around with face care and cute quotes and slapping it on chemical ridden products and just stick to the body care that they&#x27;re good at that&#x27;s about it.</li>

      <li>Most loved and will continue using.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving all the philosophy skin care products.</li>
      <li>I am going to just be honest here.</li>
      <li>My skin is combination/oily and the best thing I had found so far had been Clinique.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Very gentle and beautiful light smell.</li>
      <li>okay, i guess.  </li>
      <li>Hope to find a container that holds more product.</li>
      <li>product has saved my face, my confidence, and the headaches my boyfriend would cause me by yelling at me for squeezing my face, :)</li>
      <li>My favorite cleanser of all time.</li>
      <li>Unless the company is working with a dermatologist which I doubt they shouldn&#x27;t make any more people upset.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m enjoying my use of this product.</li>
      <li>does a better job.</li>
      <li>I love this line, hmm maybe this Purity draws out impurities&amp;#34;-</li>
      <li>Unless the company is working with a dermatologist which I doubt they shouldn&#x27;t make any more people upset.</li>
      <li>I use this stuff every day to make sure all my foundation and eye makeup comes off before I shower.</li>

      <li>I love washing my face with this in the morning and the night.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite face wash.</li>

      <li>:).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft on my skin and smells good!</li>
      <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up and dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking all the 5 stars are for Philosophy fans that can possibly use anything an not notice, some people are prone to sensitivity (my cousin can use dawn dish soap and glow alone) - anyone using this and getting good or fair results must be doing something</li>
      <li>To get healthy beautiful skin back I&#x27;m using eminence stonecrop gel wash</li>

      <li>And it&#x27;s nothing special!</li>
      <li>easy to apply and stil doesn&#x27;t get of fthe mascara</li>
      <li>It feels clean and smooth. :) .</li>
      <li>/&gt;Trying to give philosophy &amp;#34;credit&amp;#34;- since the body care line is my most favorite and Tride and True right?</li>
      <li>It might sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>Def worth the splurge though!</li>
      <li>I learned about this cleanser first time using and feel my skin clean and healthy</li>
      <li>Works great, cleans really well and has helped clear up my acne.</li>
      <li>I discovered this facial cleanser when it was included in a Philosophy Travel kit, I fell in LOVE with the Philosophy body care, specifically Amazing Grace 3-in-1 bubble bath/shower wash/shampoo/ the Perfume as well but never tried Philosophy face care before, so here was my chance</li>
      <li>guess that&#x27;s why I gave the product 1 star because I truly loved the idea of one company line covering all areas, but that proved to not be possible.</li>
      <li>I was washing my face (and I happened to be wearing a full face of makeup)</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s why, this feel good company skimped on a really neatly packaged clever named item that only disappoints women looking for something that could be effective</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s why, this feel good company skimped on a really neatly packaged clever named item that only disappoints women looking for something that could be effective</li>
      <li>Very mild and gentle.</li>
      <li>Philosophy should have reformulated this at first warnings of parabens being harmful!</li>
      <li>Very upsetting!!</li>
      <li>And tooo costly,not worth it.</li>
      <li>I love it is formula, how does it feel at the skin , I can see the difference so far</li>
      <li>Just stick with organic real fruit and real plant based products safe for your face if you get it in your eyes</li>
      <li>Just stick with organic real fruit and real plant based products safe for your face if you get it in your eyes</li>
      <li>Purity was very unkind to my face, I started the facial wash each morning in a warm shower &amp; before bed routine in the evening</li>
      <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>(2x a day) to be consistent.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe this is suppose to happen at first?????</li>
      <li>I love their products and use miracle worker and hope is not enough.</li>
      <li>Will more than likely order again.</li>
      <li>trying it and hoped, thinking &amp;#34;Ok Philosophy, are you just surfacing impurities first...?</li>
      <li>literally after the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Way too much fragrance!</li>
      <li>Although this cleanser had some nice qualities such as consistency and pretty packaging, it overall was nothing special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to most cleansers, so this review should probably only apply to those who share my skin type.</li>
      <li>no difference really</li>
      <li>i prefer my much cheaper oil of olay foam wash.  </li>
      <li>The scars from Philosophy will fade with the real deal products I have now.</li>
      <li>The scars from Philosophy will fade with the real deal products I have now.</li>
      <li>This one, not so much.  </li>
      <li>but now I don&#x27;t really want to trust the body care anymore not after this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>an apply it eeeek very painful!!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even feel like it cleaned my face very well.</li>
      <li>very painful!!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cleanser seems gentle</li>
      <li>yet it&#x27;s pearly rich &amp; soapy enough to remove makeup</li>
      <li>I have tried other Philosophy products &amp; love Purity.  </li>
      <li>Cool, don&#x27;t need an extra washing stuff for eyes, all in one!</li>
      <li>Kind of pricey for small as bottle is, but I may purchase again.</li>
      <li>I was being too optimistic just like they are with clever quotes and the feel-good sale tactics stuff</li>
      <li>i also highly reccommend hope in a jar moisturizer</li>
      <li>It feels clean and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>there has got to be some sort of science behind these nice, yummy smart products ???</li>
      <li>Eminence is the only thing I&#x27;ll use now, because it fixed the damage philosophy &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; (hah) caused to heck with philosophy&#x27;s facial care- its cheap $10.00</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Way too much fragrance! And tooo costly,not worth it.And it&#x27;s nothing special!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and beautiful light smell. Kind of pricey for small as bottle is, but I may purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month and I do like it.  The only downside would be feeling a slight dryness after using it, but I still like the product.</li>
    <li> Best make up remover!</li>
    <li> First off,  I am incredibly pale, with dry and sensitive skin...every flaw shows. Although I have never had &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;; besides the occasional breakout, I suffered from large pores, bumps, uneven skin tone, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried dozens of facial products..and 95% of them have stayed in my cabinet only after the first few uses. My skin is so sensitive, and extremely prone to drying agents.&lt;br /&gt;I have experimented with products that range from Mario Badescu, to Insta Naturals, to Burts Bees, etc..and without a shadow of a doubt-Philosophy Purity has changed my skin within days of using it..&lt;br /&gt;After doing some reading online, I learned that what I thought were whiteheads, was actually what I call mak-ne (small white bumps caused from the use of makeup that is under your skin, but are not technically acne or closed comedones; such as whiteheads or blackheads)&lt;br /&gt;A horrible habit that I created would be trying to squeeze these, hoping it would get rid of them..but it was useless. I honestly thought that nothing would work, and I was spending all this money on anything that deemed extraordinary..wasting money and taking my cabinet space..and making my skin look and feel worse.&lt;br /&gt;This Philosophy Purity cleanser, got rid of these bumps that I was driving myself crazy over..literally after the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;This product has saved my face, my confidence, and the headaches my boyfriend would cause me by yelling at me for squeezing my face, :)</li>
    <li> It works well as a facial cleanser. It leaves my skin soft and not stripped of natural oils.  It does not remove waterproof mascara though, sadly.</li>
    <li> Purity is BAD! Contains propyl paraben, which is linked to breast cancer, affects hormones negatively, causes early puberty and decreases testerone to name a few. Do not purchase any product with this, foods, soaps and beauty products. Philosophy should have reformulated this at first warnings of parabens being harmful! Methyl and ethyl parabens are also in Hope in a Tube eye and lip firming cream. I love their products and use miracle worker and hope is not enough. But shame on Philosophy for not pulling these products. It&#x27;s all about $.</li>
    <li> I got the smallest one not knowing If my skin would take it and it is the best thing I have gotten I will be buying a bigger one ASAP</li>
    <li> I discovered this facial cleanser when it was included in a Philosophy Travel kit, I fell in LOVE with the Philosophy body care, specifically Amazing Grace 3-in-1 bubble bath/shower wash/shampoo/ the Perfume as well but never tried Philosophy face care before, so here was my chance and it failed horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am angry &amp; can&#x27;t believe Philosophy almost shouts &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; products with the way they label and market, targeting women who want a product to work and trust in. How can a guilty pleasure luxury type line make an market something called &amp;#34;PURITY&amp;#34; an does the opposite causing skin to actually Break out instead. Scrolling through Amazon, seeing other&#x27;s reviews like mine. Yikes! I&#x27;m thinking all the 5 stars are for Philosophy fans that can possibly use anything an not notice, some people are prone to sensitivity (my cousin can use dawn dish soap and glow alone) - anyone using this and getting good or fair results must be doing something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s why I gave the product 1 star because I truly loved the idea of one company line covering all areas, but that proved to not be possible. Anyway- I was a fan. I am going to just be honest here. Purity was very unkind to my face, I started the facial wash each morning in a warm shower &amp; before bed routine in the evening (2x a day) to be consistent. I followed with the facial firming serum. Gave it a try only to witness consistent, painful bumps starting within a few days it was a painful sensation of tight itchy feeling* bumps around my mouth, chin, jaw line then up to my eye brows and center of my cheeks. Waking up each morning, seeing it get worse and worse. I wanted to hide in a hole! I think I yelled out loud &amp;#34;Noooo!!! Oh my gawd&amp;#34; :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad and it hurts. the stain on the face but really the pain in my heart because I love to philosophy and wanted their stuff to work on me its so sad but now I don&#x27;t really want to trust the body care anymore not after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sore &amp; painful red knots and spots were popping up all over my face and down to my neck, in random areas where typically I don&#x27;t even get a break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that was a red flag, I kept using it..... trying it and hoped, thinking &amp;#34;Ok Philosophy, are you just surfacing impurities first...? This must be working like extractions? It will get better with use, it&#x27;s sure to work...I love this line, hmm maybe this Purity draws out impurities&amp;#34;- I was being too optimistic just like they are with clever quotes and the feel-good sale tactics stuff that I look passed cuz I&#x27;m the biggest sucker for this type of foolishness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to give philosophy &amp;#34;credit&amp;#34;- since the body care line is my most favorite and Tride and True right? Wrong!!! Then seeing it&#x27;s one of their cheapest priced items, realized it&#x27;s harming my face. i was &amp;#34;Hoping&amp;#34; and that really isn&#x27;t enough *wink*  there has got to be some sort of science behind these nice, yummy smart products ??? Nope! I tried and gave up once my face couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. 3 weeks and I&#x27;d had it- Trashed the bottle, actually I passed it over to my mother who used it and she began to break out and cheese almost 60 and hasn&#x27;t had to do it since she was 13 or 14 ... SO, Breakouts were all over my entire face :(  made me very insecure and depressed with a face that was becoming increasingly inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I should have taken photos and mailed it directly to the headquarters.... Very upsetting!! I thought maybe this is suppose to happen at first????? This cleanser seems gentle yet it&#x27;s pearly rich &amp; soapy enough to remove makeup but any face care at the drug store does a better job. Did Philosophy make this to work like a professional extraction type wash????? I&#x27;m very confused, puzzled and now I really think it&#x27;s all a gimmick and marketing the way they have attached everything with whimsical quotes and making us women feel like we need this, even if its literally hurting my face to even put water and mix the soap an apply it eeeek very painful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m annoyed now, fed up with philosophy after this. Now it changed my entire view on all the products. It&#x27;s a horrible thing to go through. I don&#x27;t want other girls or women to go through what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is not even a scrub type of cleanser, but whatever is inside this product it must be riddled with impure strong toxic chemicals because In the shower it burned my eyes so bad OMG just the thought made my eyes hurt now, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes you&#x27;ll be in hell fire pain. Don&#x27;t buy this ever you&#x27;ll regret it. I got it as a gift but man learned the hard way. To get healthy beautiful skin back I&#x27;m using eminence stonecrop gel wash it&#x27;s saving my face, thank god. The scars from Philosophy will fade with the real deal products I have now. Just stick with organic real fruit and real plant based products safe for your face if you get it in your eyes it won&#x27;t stink. Eminence is the only thing I&#x27;ll use now, because it fixed the damage philosophy &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; (hah) caused to heck with philosophy&#x27;s facial care- its cheap $10.00 and that&#x27;s why, this feel good company skimped on a really neatly packaged clever named item that only disappoints women looking for something that could be effective it&#x27;s a shame philosophy can&#x27;t make something without any crap in it they should make an organic skincare line I would actually purchase if they had it but they don&#x27;t, all of it is garbage and gimmicks! The CEO of Philosophy should quit playing around with face care and cute quotes and slapping it on chemical ridden products and just stick to the body care that they&#x27;re good at that&#x27;s about it. Good smelling body creams and sprays are for the 1 star. Unless the company is working with a dermatologist which I doubt they shouldn&#x27;t make any more people upset. After all philosophy is supposed to be a feel good company so none of their products should hurt anyone&#x27;s face, truly disappointing!ting my face to even put water and mix the soap an apply it eeeek very painful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m annoyed now, fed up with philosophy after this. Now it changed my entire view on all the products. It&#x27;s a horrible thing to go through. I don&#x27;t want other girls or women to go through what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is not even a scrub type of cleanser, but whatever is inside this product it must be riddled with impure strong toxic chemicals because In the shower it burned my eyes so bad OMG just the thought made my eyes hurt now, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes you&#x27;ll be in hell fire pain. Don&#x27;t buy this ever you&#x27;ll regret it. I got it as a gift but man learned the hard way. To get healthy beautiful skin back I&#x27;m using eminence stonecrop gel wash it&#x27;s saving my face, thank god. The scars from Philosophy will fade with the real deal products I have now. Just stick with organic real fruit and real plant based products safe for your face if you get it in your eyes it won&#x27;t stink. Eminence is the only thing I&#x27;ll use now, because it fixed the damage philosophy &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; (hah) caused to heck with philosophy&#x27;s facial care- its cheap $10.00 and that&#x27;s why, this feel good company skimped on a really neatly packaged clever named item that only disappoints women looking for something that could be effective it&#x27;s a shame philosophy can&#x27;t make something without any crap in it they should make an organic skincare line I would actually purchase if they had it but they don&#x27;t, all of it is garbage and gimmicks! The CEO of Philosophy should quit playing around with face care and cute quotes and slapping it on chemical ridden products and just stick to the body care that they&#x27;re good at that&#x27;s about it. Good smelling body creams and sprays are for the 1 star. Unless the company is working with a dermatologist which I doubt they shouldn&#x27;t make any more people upset. After all philosophy is supposed to be a feel good company so none of their products should hurt anyone&#x27;s face, truly disappointing!</li>
    <li> I love it is formula, how does it feel at the skin , I can see the difference so far but I will continue using it till I can feel it in my skin !</li>
    <li> I learned about this cleanser first time using and feel my skin clean and healthy and then I use the milk cleanser and it makes my skin looks younger</li>
    <li> Generally I love all things Philosophy makes.  This one, not so much.  The smell is awful.  The price for this tiny little bottle not much more than a sample is certainly a rip off.  I didn&#x27;t even feel like it cleaned my face very well.</li>
    <li> On 3 Oz but I&#x27;m enjoying my use of this product. Will more than likely order again. Hope to find a container that holds more product.</li>
    <li> okay, i guess.  i prefer my much cheaper oil of olay foam wash.  no difference really</li>
    <li> I have used Purity for at least 5 years now.  Every once in a while I try another high end facial wash and still end up with purity.  Purity not only removes my makeup, but my eye makeup as well.  It removes everything without leaving my skin dry nor oily.  People, you must understand that the word &amp;#34;regimen&amp;#34;  is connected to beauty for a reason.  You must, must MUST drink tons of water daily; you must stay out of the sun or use spf (I&#x27;m guilty); and you must exfoliate 1-2 a week.  Your skin cannot possibly absorb everything that it is supposed to unless you exfoliate.  I use a facial wash, spray toner, eye cream and moisturizer (day and night).  I do a mud mask or facial scrub 1 time a week.  It might sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s not.  My skin, for 46 years of age, is the best condition that it has ever been.  Of course, it helps that I am not a smoker, but I do like my cocktails... :).  This is the best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used and I will never ever be without it.</li>
    <li> ive watchd endless hours of qvc when philosphy is on and always wanted to try. amazon had the best price and definately is the best face wash ive ever used. i also highly reccommend hope in a jar moisturizer</li>
    <li> Cool, don&#x27;t need an extra washing stuff for eyes, all in one!</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser of all time.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED FOR 10 YEARS!!</li>
    <li> I bought this size as a tester, but I will definitely be getting the giant bottle next. I use this stuff every day to make sure all my foundation and eye makeup comes off before I shower. It takes makeup off instantly, no more holding it against your eye and waiting for it to soak in. It feels clean and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like others that I&#x27;ve tried. I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s use as an actual facial cleanser. I prefer to use a separate product to clean my face afterwords because of the film it leaves behind, but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Philosophy products &amp; love Purity.  It is a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this for a clean face.  Try I small bottle &amp; see for yourself.</li>
    <li> This face wash removes eye make-up and all !!! love it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft on my skin and smells good! I love washing my face with this in the morning and the night. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well. Has helped my skin a lot at night. It feels clean and smooth. :) .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every facewash known to man, I had stubborn hormonal acne that seemed to respond to nothing! My skin is combination/oily and the best thing I had found so far had been Clinique. I tried this facewash and fell in love! Works great, cleans really well and has helped clear up my acne. I use this in combination with the hope in a jar night cream and the microdermabrasion peel. I&#x27;m loving all the philosophy skin care products. Only complaint is the price, it&#x27;s a little pricey. Def worth the splurge though!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. Does a great job of cleaning my face without drying it. Very mild and gentle.</li>
    <li> Most loved and will continue using. It is really the best for my aging skin.</li>
    <li> I sort of expected that the hype was over nothing, and I was correct. Although this cleanser had some nice qualities such as consistency and pretty packaging, it overall was nothing special. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to most cleansers, so this review should probably only apply to those who share my skin type. The cleanser seemed nice, although the smell was neither pleasing nor repulsive, and it broke me out within about four uses. I rarely get eczema, but the skin on my chin, cheeks, and forehead got extremely itchy and dry to the point of being scaly and rough. I think my skin might have adjusted over time and with lots of hydrocortisone cream, but I wasn&#x27;t patient enough. Don&#x27;t buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This face wash literally BLEW ME AWAY! I was washing my face (and I happened to be wearing a full face of makeup) and I could still feel the mascara on my lashes. I thought &amp;#34;Great, this face wash isn&#x27;t even taking any makeup off...&amp;#34; But after a couple seconds, I could feel the mascara almost melting! I rinsed my face and ALL my makeup was GONE! I was wearing WATERPROOF makeup! I used makeup remover afterwords and there was Just BARELY any makeup on the cotton pad! Sorry for the caps put I just can&#x27;t explain how amazing this face wash is! The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up and dry out my skin. There&#x27;s no overpowering scent! Idk why people are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t help with their acne...it doesn&#x27;t say that it was specifically for acne prone skin...lol. But if you do have acne, I recommend the Biore acne scrub! IT&#x27;S A MIRACLE WORKER JUST LIKE THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> This was $4.00 at Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was the firs titme I bought the cream.  easy to apply and stil doesn&#x27;t get of fthe mascara if not tube mascara by Blinc.  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use another eye make up remover but the cleansing action leaves my skin feeling supple and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great smell.</li>
