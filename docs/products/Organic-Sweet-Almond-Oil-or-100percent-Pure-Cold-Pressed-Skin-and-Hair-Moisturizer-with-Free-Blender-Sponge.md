<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the consistency of this product and it soaks right into my dry skin without a greasy feeling left over. Good for hair too! No fragrance, which is nice for my sensitive skin. A must try for anyone interested in trying almond oil for the first time.</li>
    <li> The oil was very nice...smooth, non greasy, loved the way it went on.  Seemed to irritate my skin somewhat as I became itchy within hours after applying it.  Will continue to use it and see if the itchiness improves...</li>
    <li> When I received this, it was open. What an oily mess. I think I threw the entire thing away.</li>
    <li> smells great.. using it on my skin and hair.  not overly oily either.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for EO&#x27;s. I also use it several times a day on my hands and nightly on my face. I also use on my hair to help with frizzes. Helps with chapped hands.  My hands are in water constantly throughout the day and this helps tremendously. The pump spout gives out the perfect amount needed. Will order again as needed</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today. My feet were so dry, my skin was just dry as could be. I used just a small amount on each part that have had the dry flaking and brittle feeling. My feet are so soft and smooth now. My legs and arms feel so much better. The cracking that my feet were doing has healed up, there are no new cracking areas but they were to the point where they were bleeding. I highly recommend this moisturizer oil for anyone dealing with this dry winter like I was. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Smooth, good quality oil. Very fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> So impressed with this sweet almond oil ! It&#x27;s silky, hydrating, &amp; feels wonderful !</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it after I shower and it absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  I also like having a pump on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the Almond oil but it causes my skin to itch but only on my legs. I tried it on my face but too much oil. But I like the feel of it on my upper body and back of hands.</li>
    <li> I honestly would give this five stars except that the bottle seal or pump cap needs improving. It lost a lot in shipping other than that this stuff is great. I&#x27;ll start with my hair and work my way down. I live in a northeastern state and at the time I received this ( at a discounted price for my honest review ) it was the middle of winter here. Very cold , and with the forced dry air heat my hair was so dry and fly away I was willing to try almost anything .Well thanks to this sweet almond oil my search is over. I was a little leary about putting oil on my hair but no one would ever know thats what I did. My hhair is now soft , managable and no more fly away. The first time I used it on my skin I put it on in the shower and let the water rinse it away, as I have done in the past using baby oil as a moisturizeronly to learn that it soaks into your skin it doesn t just kay on top leaving me feel oily. So I know put it on after my shower . My rough elbows are rough no more. The heal of feet are actually softening up. This stuff is awesome for lack of a better word. One word of caution if you use on your feet as I do put socks or slippers on so you don t slip as it does need some time to soak in. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This product was ordered on Sat. 1/31 and it was delivered on Tues. 2/3.  Shipped very promptly!  Thank you!!  As for the product -- Love, Love, Love it!!!!!  I have a psoriasis patch on my elbow that is very unsightly and this oil has almost made it completely disappear in 5 days of use.  I just can&#x27;t believe it!  I wish I would have taken before and after photos to prove it!!  Great product and I&#x27;ve already ordered another one to make sure it&#x27;s easily accessible in my home!  I will probably order some more and have one in every room of the house!!  Thank you Lux Skin Oils for prompt service, secure packaging and follow up to make sure I love my product!!  You have a customer for life and probably some of my friends/family that can see the benefits of this product!!  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this during a promotion, just to try it out.  It is amazing!  It goes on so smooth and leaves my skin incredibly soft.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I liked this oil. It goes on light and does not leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks.  It absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling silky soft.  The pump dispenses a large amount, so I&#x27;m careful to only partially press it down so I get a manageable amount.  It leaves me so moisturized that I&#x27;ve even been able to skip shaving my legs a day or two, and you can&#x27;t tell.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Love the pump bottle. Made a body oil with coconut oil, jojoba &amp; sweet almond &amp; keep pump bottle in shower.</li>
    <li> Sweet Mother&#x27;s Day Present.  Love the way this make my skin feel.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as a gift for mother&#x27;s day.... since I am 6 months preggo and need some moisturizing my tummy. I was looking for natural oil to moisturize with and he found this and bought it without telling me.... I must say this oil is very smooth and is so non-greasy. I have tried other oils and they are always greasy, especially after shower. But not this one. It was absorbed very quickly and is fragrance free! This is my first mother&#x27;s day and its the best mother&#x27;s day gift ever!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I purchased it to use as a skin moisturizer and found that it makes a great massage oil.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Happy with product. Will purchase again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product but why is it only 80 percent full?</li>
    <li> Love the product....use it for multiple purposes. .love that its organic! WILL definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about Sweet Almond oil. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product. It isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy and easily rubs into my skin. I use it fresh out of the shower and I like the way it feels. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. Which is great for me because I am sensitive to smells. I did notice that some of the product spilled into the packaging. It wasn&#x27;t a significant product loss though. I still had majority of it in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my Lux Sweet Almond Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time , I use essential oils and it works very nicely with my roller bottle  blends.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> After using it for a few days I found that my skin is not as dry as it was before. no real scent to it. its a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It has a very light, pleasing scent. I use it as a facial moisturizer. It goes on nice and smooth and soaks into your skin quickly. I also love the pump top. That makes it much more convenient to use. I am glad I took advantage of the promotion, as I have found a new product to use.</li>
    <li> I loved this oil! It was light and soaked into my skin well. Has a very light scent which is nice. I don&#x27;t like over powering scents. I would definitely recommend it to others. Will be buying agian!</li>
    <li> Pretty nice oil.  I had patches of very dry skin. I put this on there, and the skin&#x27;s soft now.  I haven&#x27;t tried other oils, so I don&#x27;t know how it works comparatively, but this certainly got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pic is a little misleading though. I thought I was getting 3 bottles, but only got one.</li>
    <li> nice i love the smell</li>
    <li> I got it today and used it tonight and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have two children with severe eczema. They have a dr. prescribed lotion that takes forever to soak into the skin and needs to be applied several times a day which makes it very inconvenient. If you miss even one day their hands crack and bleed. I put this oil on their skin and it immediately soaked in and improved the dryness of their skin. It&#x27;s going to be a favorite at our house. I didn&#x27;t smell any fragrance and the kids weren&#x27;t sensitive to it like other lotions.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for so many reasons. It&#x27;s all natural and safe for me to use on myself as well as my daughter. It has no odor or questionable ingredients. This is perfect to use before the shower, the water just beads off leaving skin super soft and silky. The pump is also a nice feature and allows for control over how much or how little you need. Highly recommend for grownups and children, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This oil has been heaven! Absolutely love it!  I have been adding some sandlewood and lavender oils with it. I haven&#x27;t needed to keep putting cheap lotion on 5 times a day my skin has stayed soft, it&#x27;s been great thank you!</li>
    <li> Great deal, great oil! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very Happy! Light oil with little to no smell. Absorbs quickly, making it the perfect carrier oil for use with essential oils. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days and it&#x27;s not too oily; Maybe my skin was really dry and absorbed it well.  So far so good</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my daughter who has severe eczema on her arms and legs.  It moisturizes well without leaving a greasy feel or stains and it has helped to clear up her dry spots in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try and review the LUX sweet almond oil.  I use this oil as soon as I get out of the shower.  It has helped with my dry skin and the moisture from the oil lasted longer than other oils (nutragena sesame oil) I have used in the past.  I will definitely purchase this oil again!</li>
    <li> The oil it&#x27;s amazing, it was everything that they said it was. Really like the container and the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> ???,,,Haven&#x27;t used long enough yet........</li>
    <li> Excellent Oil! Great quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman with natural hair and I&#x27;m always looking for a good oil to seal in all the moisture that I put in. I usually steer clear from certain oils because they are extremely heavy and they way down my hair this oil did not do that at all it is very light weight has a nice lights into it and it feels the moisture into my hair just as I want it</li>
    <li> Nice to receive a bottle of oil that hasn&#x27;t leaked, and is easy to use with a working pump. This appears to be an excellent product! I can tell a huge difference in it and the last almond oil I purchased, which wasn&#x27;t cold pressed. It it wonderful on my hair, and I&#x27;ve started using it on my skin as well. I have sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s high praise that I&#x27;m still using it, and I&#x27;m definitely going to check out their other products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this skin oil. I put it on just out of a hot shower while my skin is still damp. This is the easiest application method I have tried. There is no scent that I can detect so I&#x27;m considering purchasing an essential oil blend and adding a few drops.  My skin is moisturized and healthy feeling.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I got this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift (a little early:) and I love it.  I live in a very dry climate and this oil feels so good!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this! We especially love the pump top. It makes it very easy to use in the shower. The product has left our skin feeling so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It is not as oily as Rosehip Oil can be.  However, it is very watery.  The sprout pushes out too much oil if you are not careful.  I haven&#x27;t tried other Almond Oils, so I don&#x27;t know whether watery is good or bad.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it in all my sugar scrubs. Love that it&#x27;s not scented and makes my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> this is my second bottle of lux almond oil-fantastic stuff!! easily and rapidly absorbs, absolutely NO fragrance, and LOVE the pump bottle! excellent packaging, arrived the day after I ordered. order this product with confidence.</li>
    <li> Great Product! My skin is ultra sensitive and this product is awesome -- no rash or breakouts.  The pump is an added bonus.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love it! I make all of our own beauty products and this Sweet Almond oil fits the bill. It&#x27;s excellent for skin and hair. To top it off its organic! That&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> Nice oil. Smells good with pretty packaging. I put it on after showering to lock in moisture. One complaint: it isn&#x27;t as rich in texture as I would have hoped. Probably a good product for those with combination skin, but not ideal for folks dry skin.</li>
    <li> I grabbed this for my wife as a gift and she&#x27;s loving it.  We live in a dry climate and she likes that this oil is providing  a nice moisturizer/barrier so that her skin doesn&#x27;t dry out so easily.  She also likes that this oil isn&#x27;t flavor with scents since she has other products that do that for her.  It&#x27;s also nice that it&#x27;s 100% pure almond oil.  So this was a great find and we&#x27;re happy customers.</li>
    <li> keep in mind i got this cheap in echange for a review. its thiker than baby oil goes on smooth on the skin not sure how it works on hair.</li>
    <li> Light non scented oil. I have been using for few days for my body and tip of hair.I like it not so heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> Fairly good product,  although it&#x27;s really greasy and leaves a slimy feeling behind.  But other than that iv been happy with it</li>
    <li> What a wonderful oil!!! I love it and will definitely will order it again. It is perfect for making your own shampoo or lotion or just by itself.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin. So I need something really moisturizing. This lux oil was perfect! It helped my skin feel soft and nourished instead of itchy, flaky and dry. It absored well and didnt leave my skin greasy like you would think an oil might. I am happy to recieve this item to review. It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> Very nice feel on my skin. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp which tends to be very dry. Very luxurious feeling and it keeps your body moisturized through the day.</li>
    <li> I received this oil at a large discount and was asked to give it a review in exchange. It arrived safe and sound and I started using it a few days ago. The oil is pleasant to use and has no discernible odor so I&#x27;ll be able to use it with my essential oils. The only thing that concerns me is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; almond oil on the label whereas other companies do. Why the omission?</li>
    <li> I received this product very quickly and in great condition.  I really like the fact that this is a pump bottle.  I&#x27;ve bought Almond Oil from other suppliers in bottles that are much harder to control how much is dispensed.</li>
    <li> Came very fast and I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> This is great for dry skin!!! It&#x27;s not too greasy and it moisturizes your skin!</li>
    <li> This is a great multi use product. It smells nice. The pump is easy to use. It has really helped with my dry patches and makes my hair look and feel great. I like to apply it after a nice bath. It makes my skin feel amazing. Even though it is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. I got a sample to test and will be purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love the Sweet Almond Oil and it feels wonderful on my skin and makes it so soft. Great customer service!!  Received my shipment in just a few days after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Oil is very nice. It&#x27;s light. Mild scent if any at all. Arrived quickly and packaged well. I like the pump. Make usage very easy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Have bought almond oil before, but this seems to be of a better grade. Worth the extra price</li>
    <li> love the feel on my skin!!!</li>
    <li> Been using as a carrier oil and also to moisturize.  Works very well for both.  Great oil.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoyed this oil. I applied it on my skin and hair. Smells great, feels great, I&#x27;m a huge fan.I even got a coupon for a later purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this! males a great smelling scrub when mixed with some sugar!</li>
    <li> Have only use it for a few days, but it&#x27;s been working well  Not greasy oily.</li>
    <li> The is the best body oil I have used yet.  It leaves the skin feeling so smooth and soft.  My favorite way to apply it is right after I get out of the shower.  I don&#x27;t completely dry off.  It&#x27;s best applied when your skin is still slightly wet.  It spreads evenly and speedily and soaks in nicely as your body dries off.  I have keratosis pilaris and so exfoliating the skin when I shower is a must.  This is so soothing to my skin, and the oil helps remove visible signs of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil comes out of a pump dispenser which is perfect for getting just the right amount to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for a candid assessment of this product, I did receive a discounted price.</li>
    <li> This oil works great as a skin moisturizer or a hair oil.  I used it in place of coconut oil and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin as oily afterwards.  I used it in my hair at night and washed it out in the morning and it gave my a nice shine and kept it moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It dispenses well. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and soaks right in for all day protection!</li>
    <li> Item did meet.my needs. Great for the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Product looks and FEELS great!  Thank you...I am excited to try it on my show dogs coat as well.  Yeah, this could be just what is needed for a beautiful coat to glisten and shine even more...thank you so much</li>
    <li> I put a few drops of the almond oil in my bathtub and for shaving. Then after I dry off, I put a few drops on then as well. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the oil but the bottle was open when it arrived and a good bid of it had poured out into the packaging. The product is 5 star but the packaging is 1 star</li>
    <li> this oil goes on like velvet! very smooth and light, and absorbs quickly, though at first your skin will look very oily. the scent is so light that it&#x27;s barely noticeable. the packaging consisted of a thick cardboard tube with plastic end cap, which minimized risk of spills or damage to the bottle during shipment.  i plan to use this oil as a carrier oil for essential oil mixtures as well; a good alternative to the typically suggested fractioned coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I brought this to use is as massage oil, it is light and absorbed right into the skin. No greasy feeling at all. It is great moisturizer for dry hair and skin too. I put it on my hair and it gets soft and shiny. You can use it by itself or mixed with other oils. It is  Non-allergenic and safe even for sensitive skin. Very affordable price. It doesn’t  have a strong scent which is good for me because I am very sensitive to smells. I recommend this product. If my review helped you in any way can you please click the like button! I received this for a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great seller, arrived on time , package beautifully. Product fantastic!</li>
    <li> This Almond Oil is nothing short of amazing!  My skin has never felt so soft and smooth, and there&#x27;s no greasy feel after applying.  Added bonus is that it&#x27;s unscented!  I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This almond oil is really wonderful. For the last four years, I&#x27;ve made all all of my own skin care products: deodorant, face moisturizer, body butters and lotions, lip balm, hand salve, cleansing oil, etc. Which is to say, I&#x27;ve used a lot of brands and varieties of oil. Before finding Lux Organic Sweet Almond Oil, I shied away from almond oil because I had trouble consistently sourcing high quality, pure, organic almond oil. Lux changed that - I can tell that the quality of the oil is top notch and has NOT been adulterated with other cheaper oils or preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil is a wonderful moisturizer for all skin types - it is light yet powerful and absorbs quickly. The convenient pump on the Lux bottle makes it easy to dispense and apply. It makes a great essential oil carrier oil for aromatherapy and aromatic medicine uses. For lotions, body butters, and salves, it blends great with other carrier oils, &#x27;booster&#x27; oils (like argan and rosehip), and bees wax.  I&#x27;ll be adding it to my beauty recipes. As a straight up moisturizer, I much prefer almond oil to coconut oil - there&#x27;s no jar to dig into (and contaminate) and it is much more stable, meaning that it will not go rancid before you have a chance to use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing to note, pay attention to the bottle size as you shop around. I&#x27;ve easily paid this much for a 4 ounce bottle of quality oil. Lux&#x27;s 8 and 16oz sizes are VERY generous for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The texture is wonderful. The scent is lovely.</li>
    <li> Lux Almond oil leaves me skin feeling very soft and lasts the whole day. Its easy to apply to your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothing.</li>
    <li> What did I do before this??  My poor skin has been so dry lately since we have been staying at the in laws to help out and the heater is set close to 80.... no kidding!  I cant drink enough water or use enough lotion.  But the min I got this I went straight to the shower and  then oiled myself up.  All day I have felt so soft and moisturized.  Gonna use it again before bed. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this sweet almond oil.  I was given the chance to try this at a deep discount so I jumped on it and I am in love.  Wow!  It is wonderfully luxurious.  I have been using it after I shower and although it takes a minute to soak in it leaves my skin soft and silky the rest of the day.  Usually I have to reapply lotion on my legs but not when using this.  It has a nice smell...not strong or over-powering but it smells nice (very faint).  It can also be used for your face, hair, etc...  There are so many uses but for now I am using it for a body moisturizer. *I love that it has a pump...I hate squeeze bottles of oil or removable tops*</li>
    <li> Amazing oil. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as lotion on my body, it penetrates quick and leaves my skin very soft.  A plus for not staining my clothes.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!  Packaging good, love the product. Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.It has no smell which is a plus. I use it for my hair and skin. I have even used it for my lips when they were chapped. It is only slightly greasy when applied but soaks in quickly. I also use it as a carrier for essential oils. It is great for roller bottles. The pump is a great feature. It makes it very convenient when using the oil. The perfect amount every time.This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> The Lux almond oil was the perfect consistency, not too greasy, did not have an overpowering smell.  I use it primarily with essential oils and the Lux almond oil works as a fantastic carrier oil for full body lotions.  I would recommend this product to anyone getting into essential oils.</li>
    <li> Odorless. Absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a greasy residue. I&#x27;ve applied it directly to my winter-dry hands for immediate soothin and relief, as well as a dilution for essential oils applications. Arrived promptly and well-packaged. I would order this again!</li>
    <li> Love this almond oil and the packaging is very impressive. Thank you for providing such a quality trustworthy oil and hopefully we will see other great oils in the future!</li>
    <li> This oil just FEELS like luxury. It&#x27;s got a rich texture that smooths on your skin like liquid silk. If you&#x27;ve got dry skin or stretch marks like me, this might be just what the doctor ordered. It&#x27;s organic and pure, full of vitamins A, B, and E, and it&#x27;s perfect for giving your honey a relaxing massage, too! The pump top makes sure that you&#x27;re in control of just how much oil you want to use - what a great feature! I&#x27;m thrilled that I got the opportunity to review this product!</li>
    <li> I just got this oil today and it is very light and absorbs into my skin quickly. I love it on my cuticles. Fast shipping and the bottle arrived intact. Thank you Lux!!</li>
    <li> Faint scent.  Soaks into my dry skin very well.  My hands feel smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and packaged well. The oil is convenient with its pump bottle. The oil itself has no discernible smell to me. It feels lovely and will be great as a carrier for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is amazing I use it as a moisturizer for my face and also to tame the frizz in my hair. I love it so much!!!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful! It absorbs quickly with no oily feeling after. I works definitely purchase this oil again. My bottle came wonderfully packaged and was shipped the same day I ordered.</li>
    <li> Received a discount to test this product and I really like it!!! Already seen improvements for my skin</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I use it on my hands during the harsh cold in the winter that leads to dry hands. and i have noticed that my hands are retaining moisture and not cracking as much as they used too. great product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. So many uses. I use after shower to smooth and moisturize my skin. Great for massaging tired achy muscles after a hard day of work. Feels very fresh on your skin and hair, with no oily build up. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing !!!! I love how it feels on my skin I put some in my bath and it was awesome !!  I also made a sugar scrub with it it&#x27;s winter and my lips get very chapped. I&#x27;m sooo happy I received a chance to review this product !! I also use it on my daughter she has asthma so she has some rough patches of skin and they seem to be softening up !! This really is a no-brainer I highly recommend this product it&#x27;s versatile and it works! You really can&#x27;t go wrong here with this Oil!!</li>
    <li> I use as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it works great. Very nourishing to the skin. I have not used in any other beauty products yet, but I plan to.</li>
    <li> I received this oil yesterday and I have already used it for several purposes. I have dry, itchy skin in the winter and this oil gave just the right amount of moisture. I used it to remove my makeup and also as a moisturizer at bedtime. Great for use on chapped lips. Super fast delivery and no leakage was noted. Pump dispenses just the right amount of oil. Very slight almond smell...not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> Too much comes out when you push down on the spout</li>
    <li> Really a nice product. Shipping was great and the oil arrived without leaking.  I like the pump top. Oil is very nice - feels wonderful.  I would order this again.</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with the shipping speed, quality of the oil and even the packaging and how it was sent in the mail thus far.  I love the scent and it truly is very silky and thick.</li>
    <li> I really love this product - no residue and unscented - it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this oil for my dry hands! I love the pump too!</li>
    <li> I love almond oil, and I love the pump container this one comes in.  A very nice, clean, almond oil.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to find all the uses for this oil!  This is a great product, good quality and the shipping was fast too.  No leaky package either! :)</li>
    <li> Bottle was nice and big. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll use it all but it&#x27;s a very generous portion. Oil also very moisterizing and a little goes a long way. Only cons I could think of is if it came in a tiny bottle as well so I can put it in my purse to use when I&#x27;m not home since this is a big bottle to carry around. Would buy again because  of generous bottle size and will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well in absorbs into my skin and leaves it soft.  So nice to get rid of the dry itchy feeling.</li>
    <li> Very very good! I like it. My skin is very smooth after use.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived half full the oil was everywhere!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery &amp; nice sweet almond oil.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few day, but, so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil.  Was not disappointed, will not be without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweet Almond Oil as my moisturizer for about a year. I have tries several brands but, this has been my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the pump bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your quick shipping too!!!</li>
    <li> Pros: The Lux Skin Oils Organic Sweet Almond Oil is a wonderful product. I have a few bad reviews out there because I believe in complete honestly and I also depend on reviews when purchasing new products. I have eczema and really dry skin and this is a miracle worker. I usually have to moisturize my skin a few times a day, but now I have baby like skin. A little goes a long way and I am not greasy. The price is wonderful, especially for the size of the product. It arrived in two days. The packaging was lovely. I love the personal touch. Not only is it great for the skin, but also the hair. I gave myself a hot oil treatment and my dry and frizzy 3C/4A transitioning hair is extremely soft and moisturized. Cons:  The only negative thing is that it has no smell,  but I am glad that there are no added fragrance and chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice oil! It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin. It absorbs quickly and does not leave that greasy feeling. It&#x27;s odorless and it helps lock in the moisture in your skin. I like to put this over damp skin right after getting out of the shower. I like how it it is odorless so that I can layer it with a scented lotion if I wanted (not necessary) and or a perfume without worry about scents clashing. This is definitely a luxury type oil.</li>
    <li> First off I want to rave at the fact that this LUX skin oil is 100% Organic Almond oil! It is a great skin moisturizer for after shower and shaving. It really soaks into your skin after a few minutes of constant massaging or rubbing. This product does a really nice job while using it for straight massage purposes as well. It is unscented, many men will like that fact, especially coming away from getting a back massage without smelling to girly. I am going to hoard this during these cold winter months and hydrate my dry skin with this awesome new product! You can also use it on your hair for an oil type conditioner. Much like Argan oil. I have just finished using this product for the last couple days and wanted to post my results here since I was chosen to review this new product and give my personal feedback. One word of caution is that it is oil and it is thin. The product was shipped with the pump already attached and in a sealed plastic bag to prevent leakage. My bag had an oily residue in it and on the bottle from the oil escaping during shipping. I would maybe suggest to the manufacturer to use a foil seal and cap. Then ship the pump for the user to break the foil seal and insert them selves. Hope you enjoyed my review. Happy Hydrating!</li>
    <li> Pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! It came in a nice box and it was very protected.. I love the pump and the oil leaves you skin really soft. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Great for hair. A little too oily/shiny for my skin unless it&#x27;s really dry or at night though. Also I wish I could cook with it. I think they just say you shouldn&#x27;t but you probably can though.</li>
    <li> Received this product quickly and packaged well. Beautiful color, no aroma  and absorbs quickly. Love the pump that it came with.  I love Almond oil and look forward to using this for my lotions and body butters.</li>
    <li> This oil is soft and soaks in very well.  I really enjoy that it comes in a pump dispenser as it makes mixing and blending easy.  I&#x27;m having a blast finding ways to incorporate it into my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Very nice ,moisturizing, good for skin and hair.I am very pleased with this product. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery,I love it will be preserving more.</li>
    <li> I just received this product . I&#x27;ve used it for pre shave application &amp; for massage . I&#x27;m 100 % satisfied &amp; will be ordering more of this product</li>
    <li> This oil is smooth its not too thick and the scent was not too strong.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  But I just cannot use it the way I would like.  I have very oily hair.  So when I use this as a skin moisturizer, my hair gets greasy too because I will touch my hair.  But excellent customer service and, again, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light oil.  It is not greasy and absorbs well.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice, silky smooth oil. Absorb into the skin very well.</li>
    <li> So far I like this oil! The first time i used it in my hair (roots to tips) and it was WAY TOO MUCH! But then i put it in the ends and rinsed it out, and it made my hair so soft and not oily. Also great for the skin and I love the pump for use in the shower! You just need a small amount.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have only used it three times so far, but man has it made a difference. My skin isn&#x27;t flaky like it used to be, especially in cold weather. It&#x27;s really easy to apply, and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover large areas. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either, which is nice. The bottle is a decent size for the price as well. And the pump is easy to use. Also there is practically no scent.</li>
    <li> No scent. Great moisture, and helped the little red bumps on the back of my arms.</li>
    <li> The LUX sweet almind oil feels like silk on my skin. I literally use this from head to toe.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  I use it for my hands and feet and to tame my staticky hair in this dry winter season!  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Never realized how great almond oil is for the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing!! I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and skin and I love it. I wish I had ordered more bottles. A little of the oil goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It says &amp;#34;Skin Oils&amp;#34; on the face of the package but the fine print also mentions Hair.  I have &amp;#34;mixed girl&amp;#34; hair.  That&#x27;s curly and can end up looking dry and frizzy in some conditions.  I apply a small amount to my hair after a shower and it adds a very light moisture and shine.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair like other products and does not leave a smell.  I typically add other styling products on top of it so not having a scent is great since it is not overpowering.  My only issue is with the pump.  I had a very hard time getting it to open and pump correctly.  I resorted to unscrewing the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair that is slightly curlier and kinkier than mine.  it adds a nice moisture to her hair as well.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using any type of almond oil and I am pleased with Lux Skin Oils. It is light weight, fast absorbing, and has no fragrance. Left my skin feeling soft. Great carrier oil for use with my essential oils. The bottle came in a plastic bag that was in a nice cardboard tube but some oil did leak out during shipment.</li>
    <li> This oil is really nice. I was hoping it would have a slight almond scent, but it has no scent. Like any body oil, it takes a while to absorb, so I have to wait a few minutes before getting dressed. I definitely recommend and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> At first I thought, &#x27;hmm, I like this packaging!&#x27; (my career background is heavy in the packaging world, I&#x27;m one of few that would care), until I realized the cardboard tube didn&#x27;t have a &#x27;cool design&#x27;, but was soaked with oil (see picture). This got me worried, and sure enough, the oil had leaked...a lot (see other picture. I assume the bottle was supposed to be nearly full, not only 3/4 full). This made me sad...all that precious almond oil wasted! It made me especially sad when I used it, because it is really nice. Pleasant smell, soaks in to skin well (I knew that just by opening the plastic and getting the leaked oil all over my hands), and worked perfectly for my products! So all in all, the quality of the product itself is really great, but the packaging may have a little issue that hopefully the company can remedy so others don&#x27;t find themselves missing 1/4 of their oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing !!  Luvin&#x27; Lux !!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil!!&lt;br /&gt; It feels soft and luxurious without leaving an oily feeling on my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great oil! I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier for essential oils and it&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve also used it as a treatment in my hair and it made my hair so soft after. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair and skin. I use a few drops in my bath water and also use as a pre-poo before shampooing my hair.</li>
    <li> This oil is so light, and feels so good on my skin.  It was not greasy at all, and was just the right moisture level for my skin.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil! Love the way it makes my skin feel. I have been battling some serious dry skin this winter and this has helped tremendously.  Only down side is the pump neck leaks a little. Not bad enough to be an issue but I notice when I pump it the neck come up oily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with this oil. There is nothing that I have found that even compares to it. I have so many issues with my skin, particularly my face. I have super oily skin in the t-zone, yet it also gets very dry and flaky. Very frustrating! As if that&#x27;s not enough, my face is also sensitive to a lot of products.&lt;br /&gt;Not a problem with Lux&#x27;s Sweet Almond Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it at least twice a day on my face, neck and hands.I&#x27;ve also used it on my feet. My face is absolutely glowing! It&#x27;s so dry that it&#x27;s still just sucking up the moisture but it&#x27;s definitely being moisturized. No breakouts. No overly oily skin. My feet... fabulous! Rub on the oil and cover with a pair of socks and all that dry, cracked skin is gone in minutes, literally. I hate when my feet snag things. So gross!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my head but, at times, I consider it. This winter weather really wreaks havoc on the skin, scalp and body.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this oil for as long as I can find it. It&#x27;s well worth the money and only takes moments to apply but the results are remarkable. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Light and lovely on the skin.  Absorbs quickly...great for winter skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I make my own facial moisturizer and I sub this in where it calls for vitamin E oil. Absorbs nicely and does a good job of adding moisture to my skin especially in this rough, cold Ohio winter.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m really seeing results on my skin and it has only been a week in! Very happy will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> great product. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Works great, my hands are so dry and this was recommended to me. I work on computers and was afraid it would leave a residue on them but it soaks right into my hands and there has been no problems with it leaving a greasy film on anything.</li>
    <li> as I have asthma it is very hard to find a product for my hair and skin that does not bother my breathing.  the sweet almond oil moisturizer does not bother my breathing and seems to be doing what I need for hair and skin.  I only gave 4 stars because it is an oil and after I leave it on my skin for a while I then need to use a paper towel to wipe off the excess.</li>
    <li> I loooooooooove this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I  was using it in my hair until I read it was for the skin...oops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light fragrance and is not too oil/greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again</li>
    <li> A nice oil to use as a carrier.  Our family went through this one quickly - the pump is handy.</li>
    <li> Really loved it.  It had an oily feel when first applied but quickly absorbed into my skin.  Made my skin feel very smooth and silky.  Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!!  It  is silky soft and odorless !!! Feels great on your skin, I rub it into my cuticles and fingernails as well!  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I am a big user of lotions and use them every day. I have tried other oils in the past but they never seemed to absorb into the skin and always seemed to get on my clothing. After seeing some of the reviews I decided to give oils another try and I am so glad I did. I can&#x27;t say enough about this oil after just a few days of using this my dry heels are soft and the rest of my body is super soft and almost always has a glow to it with no greasy left overs !!!!  I have also tried on my hair (I have very curly but dry hair) I straighten it quite often and have to use creams and oils so I don&#x27;t damage my hair anymore. It seemed to work ok on the hair but you have to be very cautious not to use too much or you will get the greasy look.  The only thing I wish this oil had was a scent of some sort but of course then I would have to worry whether or not I would like the smell. So on second thought this product is perfect !!!!!  So I wanted to give an update on this product. I have already gone through a bottle and a half and I have noticed that his oil works great on dry feet you do have to make sure it is rubbed in well and then put socks on right away.  As far as using it on the rest of the body I do But I have gone back to putting body butter on after the oil because I noticed that I was getting some dry spots on my arms and legs even after using oil.  I still use this oil daily on my feet and have noticed a huge difference. They are soft and sandal ready!!!!!  Even though I am having to use body butter with this oil now I would still put it at 4.5-5 stars because it does make your skin look really hydrated, soft and glowing</li>
    <li> This has been wonderful to use on both my hair and skin.  Much lighter than coconut oil.  My skin feels so soft and my hair has a healthy shine.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I like adding oil to my my lotion, because of my dry skin. But not all moisturizing oil work for me. This is my first time using Lux Skin oil, and i can say it works well, my skin stays moist all day. I will place a second order soon, and recommended my sister to try it as well. I hope it stays on the market for long.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I personally keep the bottle in the closed drawer since the clear bottle exposes the product to light and potential oxidation.</li>
    <li> Not greasy after applying. Great for after shower or bath.  The only bad thing was 1/4th of the contents leaked out off the plastic wrap all inside of delivery package.</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging! I have extremely damaged, processed hair &amp; I used a tablespoon amount of almond oil from my mid lengths to ends before bed last night and my hair is so soft today!  It does leave a oily residue (to be expected) but I sprayed my ends with dry shampoo before heading out for work and it helped soak up the oil a bit.  I highly recommend this product!  Will be trying on my chapped lips tonight and again on my hair.</li>
