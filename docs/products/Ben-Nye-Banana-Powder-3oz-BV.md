      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many people use this</li>
      <li>but I definitely don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
      <li>I imagine you&#x27;d get many, many uses out of this jar.</li>
      <li>OK I read lots of reviews on this product and thought what the heck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>(You should not be touching your face anyways)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s outstanding :) really glad to have one :)</li>
      <li>I am in love with how finely Milled it is</li>
      <li>It arrived fast and was good packaged.</li>
      <li>It is nothing magical or that special.</li>
      <li>Despite the yellow tinge to my skin, it did leave a beautiful matte finish.</li>
      <li>Super fine powder, light feel on skin, leaves a beautiful natural brightened finish.</li>
      <li>This is a great finishing powder, not so much on the oil control for me (sadly) , is not drying at all.</li>
      <li>I am not an expert when it come to make up by any means...don&#x27;t know if there was a huge beneficial change from translucent powder</li>
      <li>but it was cheap and</li>
      <li>Amaaaazing product, really works nicely on my skin, I recommend everyone to buy it.</li>
      <li>and it is perfect for setting under the eye concealer, works just like the bobbi brown yellow concealer powder duo but much cheaper and easier to apply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is NOT the real product!!!</li>
      <li>This is perfect and I use a smaller brush under my eyes over concealer and it makes it look so natural.</li>
      <li>This powder is amazing; very soft and gives an even complexion.</li>
      <li>this product has a super fine consistency, is almost completely odor free, and applies very easily.</li>
      <li>does wonders with its brightening powers (pure magic).</li>
      <li>So I was super excited for this product to come in</li>
      <li>Secondly, the powder itself is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who loves make up and / or does professional make up should own Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana powder.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a full week.</li>
      <li>then you know how important it is to have the right powder.</li>
      <li>But there are other Ben Nye formulas/colors for light and fair skin.</li>
      <li>Mixing it with clown white powder makes an amazing shade that looks more natural yet makes a world of a difference.</li>
      <li>Overall, this product is absolutely amazing if used correctly.</li>
      <li>(I only own sigma, but</li>
      <li>Price is just good enough, reasonably.</li>
      <li>I get compliments daily about how nice my make up looks.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an alright powder, nothing exciting</li>
      <li>and it feels like Pure Silk on your Face!</li>
      <li>Great for African American skin tones.</li>
      <li>The delivery was super fast, within a week I had the powder.</li>
      <li>% Stars for Quality and shipping so fast!  </li>
      <li>I just wanted it to be a lot more yellow for contouring.</li>
      <li>Just wished it was more YELLOW!!</li>
      <li>I was just very bummed out that I was expecting it to be a lot more yellow</li>
      <li>I brush on my whole face as a finishing touch.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>just looks like skin tone like straight beige skin tone</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend buying, Kim K uses it also!</li>
      <li>It has a very cakey and flour-like consistency</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I have very oily skin and have difficulty controling this in the summer time.</li>
      <li>otherwise you will be wasting too much.</li>
      <li>I bought this Banana Powder because so many other Beauty Guru&#x27;s on Youtube kept Raving about it.</li>
      <li>Cant wait to try the other powders  :-)</li>
      <li>:) this bottle will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t need much and that makes it worth</li>
      <li>I actually do like it, specially if u have oily skinn like me</li>
      <li>was this big bummer because I was so excited to try new things</li>
      <li>This is a decent setting powder for areas that need highlighting.</li>
      <li>and  I am HIGHLY upset and will be filing a claim with Amazon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and it just kind of them reassured me that I should just stick with the same products I use it everyday.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re advertising a product that very clearly reads &amp;#34;Ben Nye Luxury Banana Powder&amp;#34; and they are sending out &amp;#34;Ben Nye Luxury Powder&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>have light (read &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;) skin, and no matter how little of this product I use, I look yellow.</li>
      <li>Initially didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft when I use this</li>
      <li>Which, had I completely read all of the reviews, I would have known.</li>
      <li>I will order the other to colors, just in case ;)</li>
      <li>Love the ben nye banana powder, looks great on, a little hard to apply, a bit high on price, but not as bad as I expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the consistency of this product. Very fine powder. It&#x27;s amazing when you&#x27;re using it to contour and highlighting the face. I also noticed, since I have oily skin, it kept the oil and shine away all day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on light or fair skin... Because then you would just look yellow. But there are other Ben Nye formulas/colors for light and fair skin. Overall, this product is absolutely amazing if used correctly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Super fine powder, light feel on skin, leaves a beautiful natural brightened finish. Great for that Kim Kardashian look as well. I have medium tan skin and it is perfect for setting under the eye concealer, works just like the bobbi brown yellow concealer powder duo but much cheaper and easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The jar is big, I pour small quantities at a wider mouth shorter container that lasts about a week, so that I can put the brush inside without grabbing too much product, also allows tapping the excess back into the smaller container. I&#x27;ve tried different brushes and the one that I find works the best is the smaller duo fiber from sigma (I only own sigma, but I believe any small duo fiber will do). Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If I was to be honest, I&#x27;d give this a 1 star rating. But since the problem is with me, not the product - I&#x27;m giving it a 4.&lt;br /&gt;I have light (read &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;) skin, and no matter how little of this product I use, I look yellow. Which, had I completely read all of the reviews, I would have known. So I can&#x27;t blame the product for my own incompetence :)&lt;br /&gt;On the upside (justifying the 4 star rating) this product has a super fine consistency, is almost completely odor free, and applies very easily. Despite the yellow tinge to my skin, it did leave a beautiful matte finish. I imagine you&#x27;d get many, many uses out of this jar. Even though its &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; 3 ounces - that&#x27;s a lot of product. For the price (and the right skin tone) this product is a win.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and perfectly good to my face. Hope to order again when I ran out. Price is just good enough, reasonably.</li>
    <li> It arrived fast and was good packaged. The product feels like a million dollar powder. Unfortunately I think I&#x27;m to pale for the specific &amp;#34;banana&amp;#34; color. I will order the other to colors, just in case ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Awesome! It does what it is supposed to.... highlights the face to create the perfect contrast or facial illusion.</li>
    <li> So I was super excited for this product to come in I&#x27;ve seen so many people use this and I thought maybe I&#x27;d give it a try. don&#x27;t get me wrong the consistency is very very good I was just very bummed out that I was expecting it to be a lot more yellow it looks identical to my Mac mineral powder. -except I would rather use my Mac. it&#x27;s good for the price you&#x27;re buying it for. I just wanted it to be a lot more yellow for contouring. Not that big of a deal my mac feels alot nicer on my skin. Just wished it was more YELLOW!! my reaction when I open the package was seriously all smiles to a complete what the heck I looked up on Google Ben Nye banana powder and realize a lot of the pictures that were posted were yellow powder but mine just looks like skin tone like straight beige skin tone and I have olive skin all I&#x27;ve ever used is Mac products I&#x27;ve never used drugstore products um Clinique 3 step cleansing is all I use besides Mac and for me to actually buy something that wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to it was this big bummer because I was so excited to try new things and it just kind of them reassured me that I should just stick with the same products I use it everyday. So im onky giving it 3 stars for the consistency and texture of the powder at the price they sell it for.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. So smoothe and luxurious... Looks flawless on my skin. I will definitely be repurchasing! 😀</li>
    <li> OK I read lots of reviews on this product and thought what the heck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a full week. Applied it different ways. I see no difference. I really don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the container. It&#x27;s too small to put the product in and to use my Kabuki brush or another similar brush to pick up the powder. It ends up all over my table. That is a waste in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few powders from other cosmetic companies that are easier to use, the product doesn&#x27;t get wasted, and frankly my makeup looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this, but I just don&#x27;t. For the money I feel the packaging leaves a lot to be desired, and most importantly, it should have made me look better!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Anyone who loves make up and / or does professional make up should own Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana powder.  You could wear it alone or mix it with a lighter color to make your face contouring stand out.  I don&#x27;t wear it everyday otherwise I&#x27;d look like an artist in my office!  I only wear to performances or photo shoots.  Mixing it with clown white powder makes an amazing shade that looks more natural yet makes a world of a difference.</li>
    <li> Works absolutely great! This product met and exceeded all of my expectations. I&#x27;ve always had a really hard time finding concealer to cover my dark circles and with this product I can use just about any drugstore concealer and the banana powder does wonders with its brightening powers (pure magic). Cant wait to try the other powders  :-)</li>
    <li> I actually do like it, specially if u have oily skinn like me it will keep u matte (:&lt;br /&gt;So far a great product I will repurchased !!!!</li>
    <li> This powder is key for setting your under eye concealer!!! You get a lot of product and the color is perfect! I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This is a decent setting powder for areas that need highlighting. I use it over my under eye concealer to set it. It is nothing magical or that special. A bit pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am hooked. I love this stuff. If you are a makeup user like me then you know how important it is to have the right powder. This is perfect and I use a smaller brush under my eyes over concealer and it makes it look so natural. It immediately takes away shine Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> I brush on my whole face as a finishing touch. It matt&#x27;s the foundation so no shine and smudges. Can&#x27;t go without it</li>
    <li> % Stars for Quality and shipping so fast!  I bought this Banana Powder because so many other Beauty Guru&#x27;s on Youtube kept Raving about it. I bought the Medium Sized Bottle and I use it as a Setting Powder under my eye Concealer as well as an all over Face Powder over my Liquid and Cream Foundations. It is Amazing how it Corrects my skin Tone! I have Sun Damage, Acne Discoloration and hyper pigmentation plus my cheeks get pink all the time and this powder Neutralizes it! I am in love with how finely Milled it is and it feels like Pure Silk on your Face! My skin is so soft when I use this that sometimes I also put it on my neck and chest area and on top of my hands too!  Hides and Blurs my forehead lines and small crows feet by my eyes and keeps my concealer from creasing too!</li>
    <li> Firstly, this vendor is great! The delivery was super fast, within a week I had the powder. Secondly, the powder itself is a good product.  My skin I would say is medium tan to now tan since its summer and i apply this powder for contouring as many youtube video tutorials can show you.  This powder goes on pretty sheer if you apply sparingly so don&#x27;t be afraid to glob it on because after you buff with a brush the results are not as drastic.  It does not look cakey at all no matter how much you apply and it does not feel heavy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for lighter skin tones for contouring because this will not show up on your face but this will work for you as a setting powder.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a great finishing powder, not so much on the oil control for me (sadly) , is not drying at all.</li>
    <li> Love the ben nye banana powder, looks great on, a little hard to apply, a bit high on price, but not as bad as I expected. It&#x27;s a little hard to use, but you get the hang of it. Kim Kardashian uses this. :) this bottle will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t need much and that makes it worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This powder is perfect for setting your concealer when highlighting.  It gives you this awesome glow.  Love it!  Great for African American skin tones.</li>
    <li> I am not an expert when it come to make up by any means...don&#x27;t know if there was a huge beneficial change from translucent powder but it was cheap and it does the job</li>
    <li> Especially on your hands! (You should not be touching your face anyways) Initially didn&#x27;t see much difference but when I shared it with my friend her rough hands turned silky soft instantly! She said she could see a difference when I applied it to my face. Has a faint smell of bananas but it is not really noticeable. You get a lot in the bottle and it seems to brighten up my medium fair complexion. However, the ingredients worry me. Talc, zinc stearate, rice starch, cornstarch, *methylparaben, *propylparaben, *butylparaben &amp; iron oxides. According to my friend the asterisked items are not good for your face. I will need to research that myself. Weird how easily I was swayed to purchase this just because Kim Kardashian supposedly uses it. It does feel like a Luxury Powder though and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time, but when I opened it, there was powder everywhere. I almost didn&#x27;t want to use it because it wasn&#x27;t sealed. I got over that and used it anyway. It&#x27;s an alright powder, nothing exciting/special. I have extremely oily skin and this was no different than any other powder I&#x27;ve used (I had to touch up after 2hrs). I don&#x27;t hate it but I definitely don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have very oily skin and have difficulty controling this in the summer time. I read reviews and viewed tutorials on Youtube and finally purchased the banana powder.  Well, it did not disappoint.  It controls my oily skin and evens out my skin tone.  I get compliments daily about how nice my make up looks.  No more oily/greasy look in the summer time.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the real product!!! They&#x27;re advertising a product that very clearly reads &amp;#34;Ben Nye Luxury Banana Powder&amp;#34; and they are sending out &amp;#34;Ben Nye Luxury Powder&amp;#34;. It has a very cakey and flour-like consistency and  I am HIGHLY upset and will be filing a claim with Amazon. This is so disappointing please you all do NOT waste your money on this FAKE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Good, I like how my make up sets when I apply it. FYI you only get ONE three ounce bottle, I was under the impression that it was a bundle buy, nope just one. Also pierce only a tiny hole in the seal cause need just a few otherwise you will be wasting too much.</li>
    <li> This powder is amazing; very soft and gives an even complexion. I would highly recommend buying, Kim K uses it also!</li>
    <li> Amaaaazing product, really works nicely on my skin, I recommend everyone to buy it. It&#x27;s outstanding :) really glad to have one :)</li>
