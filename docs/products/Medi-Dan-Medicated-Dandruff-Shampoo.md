<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used this for many years now and have had no problems with dandruff or outbreaks of sores on my head.</li>
    <li> This works really well for an itchy scalp.  Dermatologist&#x27;s prescription didn&#x27;t work but Medi Dan did!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a Doberman and the breeder told me this is the best shampoo to use.  Their skin tends to dry out easily and get dandruff, so this medicated shampoo works great.  She said to still limit baths to a couple times a year, which my dog appreciates!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it works the best of all medicated shampoos for me. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can handle my severe dandruff problem for years, and I finally found it! The Clubman Medi Dan Classic Shampoo is everything I wanted and then some; all I need to do is use it 2 times a week and the dandruff is gone. Yes, it&#x27;s very runny, smells like kerosene and stings my eyes like mad, but these are just small annoyances that I&#x27;m willing to put up with in order to get the results that I want. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband does not have dandruff but an itchy scalp.  Clubman Medi  Medicated solves his problem better than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it really works great !</li>
    <li> my order came early without any problems noted.&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad scalp psoriasis, I have my whole life. This product is the only one I&#x27;ve found that keeps my flaking and itchy at bay with out a rx shampoo. It stinks but I just don&#x27;t care because it works!</li>
    <li> My 70-year old barber advised me to use it. Really good dandruff shampoo. It is a shame that I can find it online only.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I have success with to clean my oily scalp and stay clear from Dandruff and itchy scalp.  I think it is just the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using Medi dan for twenty years and it is still working for me.Nothing els does the work as well.</li>
    <li> I brought this at a beauty supply store about a month ago and it seems to be doing the job.  Just like one of the other reviews states it doesn&#x27;t cure dandruff but it does keep your hair flake free.  I have seborrheic dermatitis and with regular use I have little to no flakes. Please don&#x27;t stop using if you don&#x27;t see results after your first use. I didn&#x27;t see a difference until I used it about 3 times.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years. It&#x27;s now hard to find in the beauty supply shops, so I&#x27;ve turned to Amazon. Service is great &amp; price is right. Stick with it and you will see a difference in you scalp.</li>
    <li> The Classic version does a great job of controlling dandruff.  It&#x27;s a little hard on the hair, but it keeps the dandruff away.  Be careful to get the Classic version of the product, however.  I mistakenly got the Extra Strength version one time.  It has a very strong menthol smell.  When I used it, it left my scalp feeling very strange.  After several days of using it, I developed an attack of Shingles that started at the top of my scalp and traveled down through my right eye.  I can&#x27;t establish that the Extra Strength version set off the Shingles, but I have been very careful ever since to make sure I got the Classic version.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product before purchasing, but it is more watery than I was expecting. A small dab will not get you a good lather, you have to get quite a bit of. Mostly because it runs out of your hand as soon as you try to put on your scalp. I can tell it is a stronger formula than other shampoos used for similar use, it really stinks. After this bottle, I will probably not get it again. Unless it gets me better results. I have only used it for a week now.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years it has become difficult to find someone that carrys it. It really works great if your have Psoriasis it relieves the ichy raw places on the scalp and heals them. I like the classic formula better than the extra strength but both work.</li>
