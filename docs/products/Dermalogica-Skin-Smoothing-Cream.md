      <li>It is very light.</li>
      <li>I use it and love it</li>
      <li>even more so now that I am in the mountains of Colorado.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews and it seems to be just what I need for these winter</li>

      <li>The cream is light yet effective.</li>
      <li>I like to use this whenever I&#x27;m taking a break from the more &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love Dermalogica products.</li>
      <li>Love this product when living in Florida and</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It did not have the feel and thickness of a cream and felt more like a lotion.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer and will probably never switch to anything else.</li>
      <li>It is light but keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking to find a cream that will noticeably smooth and hydrate your skin.</li>
      <li>this product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Finally I feel like I have nice skin!</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling hydrated, clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>This cream makes my skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I bought the product right away!</li>
      <li>and I noticed it didn&#x27;t have the same nice, light scent</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon and Aloha for making it so easy to buy.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth spending money to buy this product and would reccomend to others.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and product arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Dermalogica makes many highly satisfying skin care products, but I would not recommend this particular product for those seeking a cream for dry skin.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about 8 months, on/off, and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com went&lt;br /&gt;out of their way to make me happy by sending another duplicate order, but it to had the missing hologram!?!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to Dermalogica and although I have loved some of the other products I&#x27;ve found, I perhaps need to try further products to find one that fits my needs better.</li>
      <li>It kind of smells like burning wood and my face is a little sticky.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There was fast delivery and the product was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by my esthetician, who noticed my skin was very dehydrated, regardless of water intake.</li>
      <li>The Dermalogica was a gentle yet soothing cream to counter the rash.  </li>
      <li>But I think that what was REALLY needed 1yr ago is not so much the case now.</li>
      <li>The cream is rich, unscented and relatively inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I also do not feel it has significantly improved my overall skin as others have mentioned.  </li>
      <li>Hence, if you by a product that you KNOW works, but seems to run out of effectiveness, it doesn&#x27;t mean its NOT good, try switching up and using a similar product that&#x27;s BEST suitable for season, situation, or environment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~PYT</li>
      <li>Super gross.</li>
      <li>I purchased the dermalogica skin kit and found that I love this lotion for everyday use.</li>
      <li>as I use 2 other Dermalogica products that work fine.</li>
      <li>When he started a new chemo treatment after Christmas we discovered just how beneficial the cream was in treating side effects.  </li>
      <li>I love it it cleared up my dry skin and continues to provide deep moisturizing to my face and upper brow area</li>
      <li>I noticed that with using it 2x daily, as she directed, it did make my skin feel smoother and much more moisturized without heavy build up as I had been getting when using the \\&quot;Cetaphil\\&quot; moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product twice daily for several weeks now,  and although it has not caused any breakouts, I do not feel it is the appropriate moisturizer for me as my face feels very dry only minutes after applying.  </li>
      <li>Only issue I had again with the Dermalogica Age Smart Power Rich and the Skin Smoohting Cream is that the hologram seal was missing and for me that raises a red flag in regards to the intregrity of the product.</li>
      <li>My skin has been very dehydrated, dry and flaky.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, dry skin and</li>
      <li>I am in my mid 60&#x27;s and have dry &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>that is how little one really should use for effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Since then, my skin has been freaking out due to the dry intense heat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Dermalogica products. I have been using this for about 8 months, on/off, and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I have very sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t broken out into any rashes etc. I like to use this whenever I&#x27;m taking a break from the more &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; moisturizers that contain retinols etc. This is perfect for people who do not have a lot of fine lines/wrinkles, and also for people who do have aging skin, and want their skin to stay hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and price is great compared to what I&#x27;m used to paying for it at Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> Smells funky but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have sensitive, dry skin and this product is fantastic.  I haven&#x27;t broken out and my skin isn&#x27;t peeling in the mornings.  I apply it after I wash my face in the evenings.</li>
    <li> Again this order for beauty skin care products was placed through Amazon.com. Love this product when living in Florida and even more so now that I am in the mountains of Colorado. THe humectants in this cream bind with the water in your skin to form an unbelievable moisture barrier. Only issue I had again with the Dermalogica Age Smart Power Rich and the Skin Smoohting Cream is that the hologram seal was missing and for me that raises a red flag in regards to the intregrity of the product. Amazon.com went&lt;br /&gt;out of their way to make me happy by sending another duplicate order, but it to had the missing hologram!?! Will continue to monitor this site and report if needed any discrepancies in the quality of products.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect moisturizer if you want one without spf in it. I love it, smells great, perfect weight for my skin. I am 30, my skin clogs and is dry/dehydrated too. It helps with all those factors. the consistency is of a cream and has great ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> Disappointing experience that has cost me around $30 dollars. Lesson learned, do not buy from the internet products that can be adulterated. Bought this cream that did not feel or smell like the product I have bought before. Returned it. Was given partial credit by &amp;#34;Beauty Center&amp;#34;. A loss of money and trust.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a very effective moisturizer, perfect under makeup  but has yet to cause any breakouts. Other moisturizers for mature skin either cause acne (I&#x27;m 48) or don&#x27;t provide enough moisture. The cream is rich, unscented and relatively inexpensive. I also use and recommend  Dermalogica instant lift multi-vitamin cream for the eye area. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing gives this kind of result or has this silky texture -  can even be applied to the lid area. These are superior products.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now.  Sometimes it does leave a shine but it goes away and my makeup covers it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was fast delivery and the product was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &#x27;d use this product and shipper again.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. I use it and love it and it&#x27;s perfect for my skin! If it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> GREAT seller great product!</li>
    <li> I got a facial a few weeks ago and they used this on me and I thought it was great. It smelled amazing and it perfectly moisturized my face. I just received this in the mail and used it this morning and I noticed it didn&#x27;t have the same nice, light scent the lotion I had used before had. It kind of smells like burning wood and my face is a little sticky. Has anyone else noticed this? I smell like a fire pit.</li>
    <li> This product was unsatisfactory.  It did not have the feel and thickness of a cream and felt more like a lotion. Dermalogica makes many highly satisfying skin care products, but I would not recommend this particular product for those seeking a cream for dry skin. I was not allowed a return.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica for awhile now. This cream makes my skin feeling clean and moisturized. It is very light.</li>
    <li> Love this line of products! The cream is light yet effective. My skin stays hydrated and never becomes dry during the winter months. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product  I have used this with good results for over twenty years and I am very pleased with results</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time now but found it is cheaper here on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan. Dermalogica products are healthy for your skin.They don&#x27;t use any of the things that are bad for it or cause breakouts, like lanolin, mineral oil, or artificial ingredients. I think their skin smoothing cream is a great moisturizer that won&#x27;t create breakouts or clog pores.</li>
    <li> I recently moved from California to Las Vegas. Since then, my skin has been freaking out due to the dry intense heat. My skin has been very dehydrated, dry and flaky. Super gross. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products in hopes of getting some relief. Finally I found this cream. The feel of it is very light weight but it packs in a ton of hydration. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated, clean and refreshed. Not greasy or gross. Finally I feel like I have nice skin! This brand is expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it. Their products work!</li>
    <li> Does what it says- smoothing. Noticed a difference in less than a week. Remarkable product. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to find a cream that will noticeably smooth and hydrate your skin.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Dermalogica for years.  When he started a new chemo treatment after Christmas we discovered just how beneficial the cream was in treating side effects.  The chemo treatment produced an angry rash covering my husbands face. The Dermalogica was a gentle yet soothing cream to counter the rash.  Thanks to Amazon and Aloha for making it so easy to buy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin: normally DRY but quite OILY in the t-zones. This product was recommended to me by my esthetician, who noticed my skin was very dehydrated, regardless of water intake. I bought the product right away! I noticed that with using it 2x daily, as she directed, it did make my skin feel smoother and much more moisturized without heavy build up as I had been getting when using the \\&quot;Cetaphil\\&quot; moisturizer. Once that ran out, I purchased again but this time with Amazon for almost 50% price difference &lt;&#x3D; YAY me!!! It was purchased in Feb. 2012 and I just ran out Sept. 2012, that is how little one really should use for effectiveness. During the last month or so of use I noticed that my skin did not react to the product the same. It is STILL a great product indeed- as I use 2 other Dermalogica products that work fine. But I think that what was REALLY needed 1yr ago is not so much the case now. Not to mention, my face doesn&#x27;t appear as moisturized now (in OCT) as it did in the summer, so I will think I will be purchasing the \\&quot;Intensive Moisture Balance\\&quot; rather than the \\&quot;Smoothing Cream\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews and it seems to be just what I need for these winter months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep in mind readers, that what works for the goose may not be good for the gander... Hence, if you by a product that you KNOW works, but seems to run out of effectiveness, it doesn&#x27;t mean its NOT good, try switching up and using a similar product that&#x27;s BEST suitable for season, situation, or environment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~PYT</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and prone to break outs.  I&#x27;ve been using this product twice daily for several weeks now,  and although it has not caused any breakouts, I do not feel it is the appropriate moisturizer for me as my face feels very dry only minutes after applying.  I also do not feel it has significantly improved my overall skin as others have mentioned.  I&#x27;m new to Dermalogica and although I have loved some of the other products I&#x27;ve found, I perhaps need to try further products to find one that fits my needs better.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my esthetician. Seems to be working, will review again in 6 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased the dermalogica skin kit and found that I love this lotion for everyday use. I will continue to buy this. Shipping was quick and product arrived exactly as advertised. Very Happy.</li>
    <li> I can see the diffrence after using this cream. Worth spending money to buy this product and would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> I love it it cleared up my dry skin and continues to provide deep moisturizing to my face and upper brow area</li>
    <li> The only skin care that I will ever use. It is light but keeps my skin moisturized. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Goes on very nice. I use it during the day when I don&#x27;t need a cream with an spf. Usually when  I am at home. I am in my mid 60&#x27;s and have dry &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This really is an amazing product. I love this moisturizer and will probably never switch to anything else. Get it now!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this moisturizer.</li>
