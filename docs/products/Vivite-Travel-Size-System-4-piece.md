      <li>and then I actually found it cheaper at abzoo, and my order was completed perfectly.</li>
      <li>Have used these products for years now an love to be able to take them on vacation.  </li>
      <li>I have used these products for years and love them</li>
      <li>In addition, this is a quality skin care line used in many aesteticians&#x27; clinics.</li>
      <li>The product was recommneded by a dermatologist and I am pleased with it.</li>
      <li>However, if you just want to preview the product line before you purchase the regular sizes - this is a Great Buy!</li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the description.  </li>
      <li>just make sure it was going to be ok for my skin</li>
      <li>The night cream and the antioxidant serum are my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use many of the Vivite products already, but hadntt tried the night cream or the eye cream.</li>
      <li>The exfoliant is okay, I add a rougher one to help it exfoliate, but use the Vivite one with it to add the glycolic acid.</li>
      <li>This is called a travel kit, but its more like an overnight bag.</li>
      <li>I love this product line.</li>
      <li>and it did, i love it</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the product and having a travel size avaiable is a boon.</li>
      <li>but as a sample it was ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using it for years, therefore I&#x27;m very familiar with it.  </li>
      <li>The serum is really nice and absorbs quickly; I saw some results with that.  </li>
      <li>If the product works for me, I will order a full size!</li>
      <li>Most of the time I end up buying full products and when they give me a rash or make me break out, I have to give them away to my girlfriends or throw them out.  </li>
      <li>I was able to try some of the recommended products without incurring the cost of full size products.</li>
      <li>I was able to try them for a full week</li>
      <li>After purchasing these products from my plastic surgeon and falling in love with them I started buying the full size products on amazon or ebay</li>

      <li>The moisturizer absorbs well and definitatly helps keep skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>Not only excellent skincare products; perfect travel sizes for short to moderate length trips.</li>
      <li>I was not too happy when I finally received my order.</li>
      <li>It looked as though someone had used their finger to smooth over the surface of the creams.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy your vacationðŸ˜Ž</li>
      <li>travel size system is helpful for items such as the eye cream and serum - great products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very god for travel, like Vivite</li>
    <li> Save your money!  This is NOT a &#x27;Travel Size System&#x27;!. The products are tiny and labeled &#x27;SAMPLE ONLY NOT FOR RETAIL SALE&#x27;. Shame on you!!</li>
    <li> I love the product and having a travel size avaiable is a boon. The product was recommneded by a dermatologist and I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I use it in the morning  and in the evening to clean my face  I see less fine lines  a little pricey</li>
    <li> I already use these products and am very happy with them. It&#x27;s very convenient for me that this travel pack has all of the products I use. They are PERFECT for traveling since they dont take up much space and easily fit in your quart size zip lock bag</li>
    <li> This line of beauty products receives good reviews so I wanted to try some out for myself without gambling on a full size item. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of the products. I hadn&#x27;t tried out much products containing glycolic acid so I had no idea what to expect. The exfoliating scrub has a fine grit to it and feels good, though I prefer to use face brushes to get a good scrub. The face serum has a nice lightweight consistency that soaks in easily. I&#x27;m not in the habit of using an eye cream but this is a good one. Finally, the night cream which is my personal favorite of the bunch. It has the highest percentage of glycolic acid in it and feels nice as a night cream on its own. I had been using a lactic acid cream which left my face extremely sticky, so I was pleasantly surprised when this one felt like a regular face cream. I&#x27;m getting the full size of the night cream and may try the day moisturizer with spf in the future.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy my vivite products from abzoo vivite shop because there were some bad reviews on amazon about expired products, opened, half full, etc. I am so happy with my purchase. It arrived very fast and came in a beautiful velvet case, also with a FREE vivite core travel kit. I paid $156 for the complete core system, daily face wash and got the travel kit, including priority shipping. I had looked for days on amazon thinking that it was the best price, but was hesitant about the bad reviews and then I actually found it cheaper at abzoo, and my order was completed perfectly. It&#x27;s obvious that my vivite products are brand new and have never been opened. I even got a hand written thank you note and smiley face on my invoice. I will get all my vivite at abzoo from now on :) :)</li>
    <li> My eye cream was dryed up other wise all was good</li>
    <li> I received this product and was a bit disappointed when I opened it. The small bottles were lacking product volume. I gave feedback to the seller and they sent me another set with an apology for the inconvenience! THAT&#x27;S great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love that they sell this in trial sizes!  I found great reviews for this product and wanted to try it, but as I have learned from past experiences, I have very sensitive, allergy prone skin.  Most of the time I end up buying full products and when they give me a rash or make me break out, I have to give them away to my girlfriends or throw them out.  I have wasted thousands of dollars doing this.  With the trial size it is only $21 and free shipping, plus if I like it, I can order the full products and keep the travel size for travel.  These are great products.  I was able to try them for a full week (sometimes it takes time for my skin to react) and still have product left.  I have now ordered the full size products and another travel size one for when I travel.  I only hope that this one lasts until the full sized ones get here.  I only wish they would make travel sizes (or trial sizes) of their other products.  I think I would be willing to purchase more if I could try them out first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up.  I experienced a problem getting the serum pump to work.  It pumped fine for the first couple of times and then would just pump air bubbles.  I went back to Amazon online and looked at the reviews for the full sized product and they had the same problem.  One reviewer said that if you turned it over and tapped on it a couple of times it would work again.  I tried it and it did work.  So if the trial sized serum pump stops pumping, turn it over and tap it on the bottom a couple of times.  I now just do this regularly when I go to use it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me, but there is nothing spectacular about it. Think it is more hype and marketing than actual results, but it&#x27;s not bad either. I think there are better products in the same or lesser price range.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. The quality and results are exceptional, BUT... the trail size is very small, barely enough for a full week of travel. However, if you just want to preview the product line before you purchase the regular sizes - this is a Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these travel systems in Dec 2011.  Bottles were only half full. Contacted Forever Young Beauty via e-mail and a written letter. No response to date to either of my messages. I rated this with 1 star because there is no option for no stars.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for along time in the past.  It is a great product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amy</li>
    <li> At the time of purchase I paid $11.00 for this \\&quot;intro\\&quot; or \\&quot;travel kit.\\&quot;  Great price for what I got.  The eye cream lasted the longest and I really like the \\&quot;scoop\\&quot; they provide.</li>
    <li> Vivite products were recommended by my dermatologist office. I was hesitant to buy due to the price and that I have extremely sensitive skin. I happened upon this travel size kit while searching Amazon for Vivite. It was perfect. I was able to try some of the recommended products without incurring the cost of full size products. The products are great, the price can&#x27;t be beaten, and they arrived promptly. I will definitely buy these products again, especially the eye cream.</li>
    <li> Horrible bottles half empty,, used</li>
    <li> travel size system is helpful for items such as the eye cream and serum - great products.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.  The sample size is a good way to test it and decide if I want more.</li>
    <li> The system was recommended to me by my dermatolgist&#x27;s office.  It is expensive, so I ordered the travel size to try it out.  Definitely worth it, and Amazon has great prices on the individual components.</li>
    <li> I love all 4 products by Vivite and can see a definite improvement in my skin- it&#x27;s vibrant, smooth and a lot less dry. This 4 piece set is the perfect way to assess these products &amp; I will guess after trying them, you will want to buy the whole line!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive travel sizes I received a professional sample that said, &amp;#34;Sample not for retail sale&amp;#34;  and they were teeny tiny bottles were not even close to being full.  Disappointing for sure.  The products are all good products it just this kit is a total rip off.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and was thrilled to get extra samples.  Would definitely buy from again.  Have used these products for years now an love to be able to take them on vacation.  Leaves me a lot more room in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a partial bottle of Vivite serum to experiment with as I do not like serums as a whole. But, this really surprised me, so I ordered the travel size so I could try all the products, and honestly, I love them! I will certainly reorder this,</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the description.  These are very small sizes, probably worth thre money, but they weren&#x27;t very moisturizing.  (I have dry, mature skin). If you&#x27;re already using thre brand, thren it&#x27;s probably okay for a few trips.</li>
    <li> Small samples of each product allow one to try each product before purchasing larger sizes.  Also, the small containers are really great for travel.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel .. All you need for skin care to go.. Enjoy your vacationðŸ˜Ž</li>
    <li> GREAT TRAVEL KIT....perfect size to travel with...all the necessary items all wrapped up in one nice little travel kit... AWESOME product...</li>
    <li> vivite products are awesome, i try this just make sure it was going to be ok for my skin and it did, i love it</li>
    <li> Not a Travel Size -  Labeled &amp;#34;physician sample&amp;#34;.  The sizing could be much larger if it was a true travel size.  it will last you1, maybe 2 weekend trips at best.</li>
    <li> These products are great, use them daily and the small size even go in the on the flight back TSA checks.  Good value, good sizes.</li>
    <li> All my bottles and tubes said &amp;#34;samples not for retail sale&amp;#34; on them. I feel like I got taken for $30.  Also not very impressed with the product yet...haven&#x27;t been using it for very long. Unsure of how soon I should be seeing results.</li>
    <li> After searching for the best prices possible on this brand, this was the best value by far.  In addition, this is a quality skin care line used in many aesteticians&#x27; clinics.</li>
    <li> I was mostly looking for the Facial Exfoliator, but wanted to try it out before buying a full bottle of it on its own. So far, so good, and it only takes a &amp;#34;nickel-sized&amp;#34; amount for each use, so even this tiny bottle is lasting a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other product I&#x27;ve tried so far from this set is the eye cream, which is very thick and seemed to leave a white residue on my face after drying.</li>
    <li> Good deal for small amounts.</li>
    <li> The eye cream and night moisturizer I received was tinged brown, hard, and smelled. I emailed Amazon and they refunded my money right away and offered to pay for the overnight shipping of a replacement. I rated this 1star because a seller should not have expired product...period. I hope my replacement is better quality. Last year I paid $9.99 for this travel kit, and now it&#x27;s $16.99. I would think that price hike would result in fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is awesome. You really could tell the difference in your skin just after a few uses. These small sizes are convenient for travel or just for sampling the Vivite line. I highly recommend it for aging skin!</li>
    <li> All four products have sample not for resale stamped on them.  I have used these products for years and love them but when I received. It from this company the night cream was brown and it should not be brown. It is going back!</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely but did nothing for my face but cause irritation. On top of that it is yellow and smells horrible.</li>
    <li> Both glass jars were damaged and broken glass in the package.  I do not have time to go back and try to re-order the product. And it took a long time to get the Vivite.Travel Size.</li>
    <li> I have used the Vivite moisturizer for a while and love it, so I thought I would try some other products by this company.  The travel size kit was a good opportunity to do so.  I liked everything except the night cream and the eye cream.  The serum is really nice and absorbs quickly; I saw some results with that.  But the other two products not so much.  I found the night cream just sat on my face and if I rubbed my skin it would come off in little pieces, like if something sticky was on your face and dried.  I applied after cleansing and made sure my face was dry enough.  The eye cream is a nice texture, but I just didn&#x27;t see a result even as far as moisturizing.  This was worth the trial as these products are not inexpensive.  The moisturizer absorbs well and definitatly helps keep skin smooth.  I never get the dry skin around my eyebrows that I am prone to with this product.  The formula really helps texturize your skin so it is like new with a smooth, soft texture.</li>
    <li> Not only excellent skincare products; perfect travel sizes for short to moderate length trips.</li>
    <li> Great little starter kit, I travel with it, it fulfills my need for travel size which doesnâ€™t get taken by security at the airportsâ€¦  Great little products will repurchase as I run out.</li>
    <li> DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE.  DIDN&#x27;T LIKE THE EYE CREAM AT ALL...I DO LIKE SOME OFTHE VIVITE PRODUCTS, BUT JUST TOO EXPENSIVE.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try some items from Vivite w/o breaking the bank, this is the perfect way to do so and i am glad i ordered the travel sizes first. The eye cream is very mediocre, at best. I am NOT able to wear my concealer over this cream, makes my under eye area look dry, so i&#x27;m sticking to my original eye cream (Cellcosmet). The facial cleanser is ok, but my Olay is just as good. The product that i love and WILL re-order in a larger size, is the night cream. It is neither too heavy or too drying, right in the middle and works well for my skin type. I can recommend this one product.</li>
    <li> The product I received was old. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Excellent for travel.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be good for travel but the products are so small that the price just seemed completely off and if I go two days without running out I will be grateful.  Live and learn.</li>
    <li> These are great skincare products. If you use them regularly they will make a noticable difference.&lt;br /&gt;The only reservation I have about using them regularly is they contain Parabens. Hopefully the company will change this someday.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected and one of the jars looked like it was half gone and had been used but as a sample it was ok.</li>
    <li> love this product. anything vivite is great</li>
    <li> I got this kit about 3 weeks ago.  Noticed a difference in my 73 yr old skin within 1 week.  Improvement every week.&lt;br /&gt;Great to be able to try the whole regime.  Will buy the ALL the individual products.</li>
    <li> Bought one set before, but it was around 9.00.  This is good for a weekend away without taking all the full size bottles.</li>
    <li> Bottles were full and a great travel size. This makes travel more convenient as I hate being without this great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just very very small - I love vivite products but the travel size is extremely small.</li>
    <li> I bought the trial size &amp; love it! I never knew how many dead dry skin cells were truly on a face.  This product is awesome to say the least. i&#x27;ll have to get one at a time as to fit my budget, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Save your dollars..... worthless samples . They were not sold as &amp;#34;samples though.&amp;#34; Was expecting &amp;#34;travel size.&amp;#34; as indicated. tricky marketing</li>
    <li> this travel set was obviously old stock and was not as good as it should have been.  Did not live up to expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product but this is a trial size. if you buy this get in regular zise, its the best. The products work great and leaves skin feeling and looking great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love Vivite products and this little 4 piece kit is just what I needed to take on trips.  In the past I have transferred product to bottles and that is sometimes a waste because the bottles don&#x27;t dispense very well.  To me that is a waste of product.  This system is perfect.</li>
    <li> Very little amounts. Truly overpriced. These items are similar in size to  promotional&lt;br /&gt;gifts given with a purchase at department store cosmetic counters.</li>
    <li> I was not too happy when I finally received my order. First I was missing 1 out of the 4 then the eye cream looked like it had been used already. Very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference in my skin using these products so I will not be purchading again. Like Perricone!</li>
    <li> The packaging said not for sale.  Promotional Trial Size, not Travel Size.  I&#x27;m surprised you can sell this.  I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
    <li> I  am glad they had the travel size so that one can test it. It is ok but I really dont see paying that HUGE expense for full size products if the results are not something that at Dramatic and at least view changes visilbly within the first 30 days at least.</li>
    <li> I love Vivite products. The set of stuff that I ordered arrived and the two creams are hard as a rock. I tried to add a smidge of warm water, no help.&lt;br /&gt;If you want Vivite that isn&#x27;t 10 years old and expired (I am assuming?), order elsewhere. The company hat shipped mine was \\&quot;Beauty Nation Group.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fresh stuff ROCKS - I have some. I highly recommend it. The night cream and the antioxidant serum are my favorite. The exfoliant is okay, I add a rougher one to help it exfoliate, but use the Vivite one with it to add the glycolic acid.</li>
    <li> After reading a few reviews I was concerned that this kit would come in 4 different packaging/shipments or not as a gift box set. However, it showed up in a nice purple box, original packaging, at half of the original price! the 4 pieces inside the purple box had their individual original packaging as well. I bought this because I had used the travel size kit when I was traveling with my friend during vacation. My friend&#x27;s roommate works at Allergan and it was recommended to her. We loved how our skin felt after using the exfoliation cleanser (it was instantly so soft!)  and then the night cream. My face felt great, soft and not greasy or too dry (unlike with some other cleansers). Hightly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- This review was meant for the full size kit. I bought both 3 travel size as gifts and full size for myself.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years, therefore I&#x27;m very familiar with it.  I give it one star because I&#x27;m suspicious of the company I ordered through. My products arrived, some of them half full. It looked as though someone had used their finger to smooth over the surface of the creams.  The night cream and eye cream were a grey color and had a smell that this product has never had before. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in the containers, but it&#x27;s not the product I&#x27;ve been using for years. I won&#x27;t order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this kit yet, but if it is as good as the other Vivite products, I&#x27;m sure to love it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Vivite Travel Size 4 piece set. I expected the items to be at least 3/4 full of product, yet, 1 item, the Vivite facial cleanser was closer to half full. How disappointing!! The size of the products was more like a sampler-size rather than the stated travel-size set. I should have taken notice from previous reviews that some items were missing product within the container. I give it 2 stars for the variety of product, however, I would NOT purchase this set AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I ordered the travel size to try this product to see if I liked it. I have oily skin so I really didn&#x27;t use a lot of the night cream, so the jar was a decent amount for me. I think I liked the serum the best but there wasn&#x27;t enough in the bottle. It didn&#x27;t even last a month. There is no such thing as an age-defying product that works in that amount of time. I really think that if a company swears by their product, they should have free samples enough for 60 days. If the product works for me, I will order a full size! I need the time to test it first.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Gave as gifts.</li>
    <li> The product does&#x27;nt stay in the case very well. Product good.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little travel set but not large enough for more than a week. I was somewhat disappointed only in the size but definitely not the product. Love, love, love Vivite products!</li>
    <li> This set is not only great for travel,  I originally ordered this set to try out the four products it contains.  I was so impressed by the results that I later ordered the regular size of all four products.</li>
    <li> After purchasing these products from my plastic surgeon and falling in love with them I started buying the full size products on amazon or ebay and I purchased a few of these travel size sets for stocking stuffers for my mother and sister in law so they could give them a try.  Also used a set for my recent honeymoon.  If you use them sparingly as directed you&#x27;ll be suprised how long these little samples last!</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s for travel, not for everyday use. Or you can pick up to try the products.&lt;br /&gt;The products are concentrated, so you don&#x27;t need much anyway.</li>
    <li> Noticed this product at my Plastic Surgan&#x27;s office.  They sell it and think it&#x27;s a great product.  That&#x27;s what took me to amazon!  I found it and bought it.  I thought it would be great to try a small size first.  Wanted to maker sure I even liked the product.&lt;br /&gt;I do like it and feel it&#x27;s a great value compared to other prices!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect package either as a sampler or for travel. I use many of the Vivite products already, but hadntt tried the night cream or the eye cream. After 3 days with the samples I ordered both! I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with Vivite yet!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this and was expecting great results.  I didn&#x27;t care for the texture and the creams felt inexpensive.  Went back to Eminence and was very pleased.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Travel size yes but broke in my bag,  glass all over my set,  had to throw away</li>
    <li> This is called a travel kit, but its more like an overnight bag. There is not enough here to last through a week&#x27;s vacation. Plus its kind of pricey for such small quantities. What gives?</li>
    <li> I received products that are labeled Professional Sample not for Retail Sale, Sample only!! Paid for a product that my dermatologist gave to me for free!! I just wanted travel size of products for upcoming trip.</li>
    <li> Vivite is the elite skin care product on the market do to the GLX Technology. Try it for yourself, you will not be disappointed.</li>
