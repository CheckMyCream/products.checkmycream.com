<li> your face cream should be pretty thick, if you turn your container on its side the cream should stay put..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this product on a special deal and it actually sat in my cabinet for a year because I forgot about it.  Silly me.  Now I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  It is awesome and quite soothing.  It is not greasy or oily and make up goes on nice.  I have reordered this product now 4 times since I started using it and will continue to do so.  Works great with the swisa beauty sensation line reversal poly peptide serum.  This is the stuff you find in the local mall for twice as much. Watch your face become health looking!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Bought it at Christmas time and have loved it ever since.  Feels good, I don&#x27;t break out and it makes my skin soft and smooth..  I&#x27;m 53 and have tried several different products, I will be sticking with this one... It only takes a little to cover my skin and neck and it goes along way...</li>
    <li> This product is the best.Starting using it atleast 5 years ago.  My skin is in really good shape.  The shipper for this product was fast and convenient. I would definitely would place another order with this vendor.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about one month and have noticed that my skin is brighter and firmer. I have used very expensive products in the past but I am sticking with this one from now on. Great price and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the way the moisturizer makes my skin feel.  After cleansing and adding the moisturizer, my skin feels great!  No tightness that you normally get after cleansing.  Since I&#x27;ve been prone to acne, I&#x27;ve found I can use this product year-round with no skin breakouts.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years. I have problems with most creams that touch my skin. I&#x27;ve never&lt;br /&gt;had an issue with this. I like how it feels.</li>
    <li> I will never purchase through this company again.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  They don&#x27;t sell the same product (isn&#x27;t the same consistancy or color) and when I sent it back - I never received credit and they claim they \\&quot;never\\&quot; received it.  Shame on me for sending it back USPS... lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizing creme for approx.20 years.I love this creme for my face.It&#x27;s not greasy and you only use a small dab on different parts of your face and it firms your skin as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it does an amazing job keeping my skin healthy and youthful. This store offers the best price and fastest delivery that I have ever encountered.</li>
    <li> The old one worked very well and it smells great too. The new bottle with &amp;#34;Sensation&amp;#34; on it does not smell the same, the color is different and the cream is thinner. So far I found that it is still working ok. It gives my skin enough moisture. I will have to continue to use it see if it will firm my skin like the old one did. When a manufacture started to make change on a product like this, it just makes me start to have doubt on the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s lightweight and smells good.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the texture and most especially, I love how my skin feels afterwards. I ordered several of these.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works very well. It isn&#x27;t thick, but moisturizes dry skin. It is also fairly inexpensive. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I find that the picture and description mentions Sensation but the jar I got does not have that on there.So many stickers covering bottom of jar and upc bar code.  I didn&#x27;t see the last company I ordered from on her and tried this place.  I don&#x27;t like to see a picture of a product then NOT receive that same product I pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned I find this jar not runny it seems to be the same product smell wise and consistency wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if I reorder from this company.  I hope they state in the future what they are sending correctly though.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer in the last two jars has been runny. It seems like an old product. It doesn&#x27;t seem like what I used to get which was never runny or thin, but thick and creamy.  I think I&#x27;ll order directly from Swisa from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years and I love it..It is the best if you get the real product, however it seems to be a that there are several dealers that are selling fake products..your face cream should be pretty thick, if you turn your container on its side the cream should stay put..I have bought several through Amazon and sometimes I get the real thing and sometimes not..You never know what your getting..I am going to look for a new product so I no longer have to order online. It was a great run though.</li>
    <li> Light weight and gentle, this stuff leaves my face so baby soft and smelling so great! I have been using Swisa products, including the face peel for about a year. I had really bad acne (I&#x27;m 30, and having never had acne before in my life, it started to pop up when I turned 27). A woman in the mall stopped me and put me on a strict skin regiment using this stuff, and within a month  my skin began to clear up. Today I am acne free and people are amazed when they here I am 30, my skin is that of a 20 year old. Amazing stuff. I would recommend Swisa products to every woman and man in this world if I could!</li>
    <li> I love this product also, but I notice it is more costly , than when I purchase it, why is that.</li>
    <li> Like all Swisa products this does helpthe skin and is NOT greasy or leave a residue. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> One of the best firming moisturizers I have ever used.  it&#x27;s done a lot for this 70 year old face.</li>
    <li> Good cream but can cause allergies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for many years and am a huge fan. I have fairly oily skin that breaks out easily and this doesn&#x27;t cause any additonal break outs and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; claim  as I&#x27;ve used it so long that I don&#x27;t notice any difference but maybe if I stopped, I would?  It has a light fragrance and isn&#x27;t over powering or oily.  Amazon had it at a reasonable price, delivery was prompt.  All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this product !</li>
    <li> No, I am not happy at all with my purchase of the Swisa Beauty Dead Sea Firming Moisturizer.  I have been using this product for several years.  This is the first time I purchased it from the Cosmetic Beauty Place.  It is NOT the same product produced by Swisa that I have always used. If I were to hold the jar upside down, the moisturizer is runny and would spill out of the jar. The product I have always purchased from Swisa would not spill out of the jar and is completely different .  I will not purchase any more products from the Cosmetic Beauty Place.</li>
