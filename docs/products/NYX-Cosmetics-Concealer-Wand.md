### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m as fair skinned as they come.  </li>
      <li>sometimes i use the matte again, just a bit, on top of foundation but just on my under-eye, nose and hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used to use the stick version, but the liquid version is much better.</li>
      <li>You might need to build up a bit more concealer to hide the tint, but it works well and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This works WAY better than the potted version as this is more blendable and not cakey in the slightest.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good concealer</li>
      <li>I was kind of dissapointed, it looked more blue than anything.</li>
      <li>Look for another product that actually has more in it and blends better.</li>
      <li>Very creamy, easy to blend.</li>
      <li>I liked the concept, but this definitely did not work for me.</li>
      <li>Make sure moisturize well daily to help it go on smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin is really  sensitive and im super fair but also have a red tone</li>
      <li>I had some surgery and once the wounds healed, it left me with some bright red scars that were easily covered by this product.</li>
      <li>but seriously-- regular, people-colored concealer works better than alien-colored concealer.  </li>
      <li>but i would recomend a moistersizer or primer first then concealer.</li>
      <li>It really helps conceal imperfections, and works well with foundation!</li>
      <li>I start with cover girl&#x27;s true magic clear matte, then add the NYX cosmetics concealer, and then my regular foundation.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well.</li>
      <li>It dries far too quickly.</li>
      <li>This concealer really helps eliminate the acne.</li>
      <li>you dont need much at all</li>
      <li>But with being fair you also get redness, and it makes any foundation I put on look like I put a layer of pink on my face, regardless if it&#x27;s yellow tone, neutral,</li>
      <li>Using this alone left my skin color completely neutralized and putting this on top of a pinker foundation</li>
      <li>The container is very misleading as it makes it look larger than its true shape.</li>
      <li>The problem is that the formula is much thicker than the yellow, and dries quickly, so if you don&#x27;t blend FAST</li>
      <li>I really love the NYX yellow concealer wand for under-eye circles, and I wanted to try this to even out a couple red spots.</li>
      <li>Just a tip, I&#x27;d put a small bit of your foundation on first, then put a little more on top.</li>
      <li>High end or drugstore.</li>
      <li>It also conceals the red spots on my face nicely, without adding so much pigment that I look like a zombie and need a ton of foundation to cover up the green.</li>
      <li>To put it in perspective, I have to mix white foundation with my makeup because there is NO foundation on the market light enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Good concept I guess, that totally fails...at least for acne.  </li>
      <li>I suppose if you have smooth skin with faint pink areas you are worried about, you could rub a minuscule amount of this in really good and then cover with makeup....</li>
      <li>So then you have to really rub it in, and then cover it up with regular makeup or concealer.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so I get that green and red make brown, so</li>
      <li>however, compared ot other NYX products, $4 seems about right</li>
      <li>If you use a little it corrects the red and makes the skin almost white, which is then easy to cover up with a natural color.</li>
      <li>As someone who has acne, my skin is usually a nice splotchy red (this is due to just random red marks and not entirely the acne, and no, my skin is not affected by the face make up), and when i use one wand full of the concealer with some regular skin tone foundation on top, it does wonders to counter the redness of my pale skin and acne.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have light tan skin, this was not a good product to cover up any redness or blemishes I had.</li>
      <li>and it rubbed right off :/.</li>
      <li>tube is quite small, maybe the size of your ring finger, but it lasts months as you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>

<li> and it rubbed right off :/.</li>
<li> tube is quite small, maybe the size of your ring finger, but it lasts months as you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s highly pigmented so you only need a little bit of the product, which means it will last longer.</li>
<li> Since this is a concealer, a little goes a long way and it is very pigmented.  </li>
<li> totally gets rid of my red tones in my skin but a tiny dab goes a LONG way.</li>
<li> I have terrible redness on my cheeks and was told to try green concealer and this product used with my foundation blends my skin into a perfect porcelain color!</li>
<li> This green corrector is a must have for combating foundations that leave too much of a pink tone in addition to your natural redness.  </li>
<li> WHO HAVE DRY SKIN: BEWARE!</li>
<li> I picked up the NYX concealer wand in green since I had luck with a green Maybelline product in the past but the green in this concealer is too light and the liquid has a consistency that it does not blend well.</li>
<li> the idea is that the green tint evens out the reddish spots on your skin to equal flesh tone.  </li>
<li> I had a few (non raised/ flat) pimple scars that I wanted to conceal.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> And if you have any rough spots at all like scabs or dry skin, it will just catch on it and stay green.  </li>
<li> suggest buying this online for $4, mostly because I can NEVER find it in store :(</li>
<li> Ehhhh maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but this green concealer doesn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.  </li>
<li> It fell heavy on the skin and not very smooth.</li>
<li> helps tone it down a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!</li>
<li> Tried covering up the green tint with a tan foundation, as well as tan concealer.  </li>
<li> it looks, well, green.  </li>
<li> you look like you didn&#x27;t quiiiiiiiite wash off a clay mask. :/</li>
<li> This stuff will heavily highlight your dry areas and make your skin feel uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Use very little!</li>
<li> In addition it I noticed that this items had a very small amount of product in it.</li>

    <li> Ehhhh maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but this green concealer doesn&#x27;t really work like I thought it would.  Okay, so I get that green and red make brown, so the idea is that the green tint evens out the reddish spots on your skin to equal flesh tone.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way for me at all!  I am a light-medium skin tone brunette with acne.  If I try to use this on a reddish spot....it looks, well, green.  So then you have to really rub it in, and then cover it up with regular makeup or concealer.  By that time, the difference is nominal.  And if you have any rough spots at all like scabs or dry skin, it will just catch on it and stay green.  Good concept I guess, that totally fails...at least for acne.  I suppose if you have smooth skin with faint pink areas you are worried about, you could rub a minuscule amount of this in really good and then cover with makeup....but seriously-- regular, people-colored concealer works better than alien-colored concealer.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Redness on chin surrounding area still leaches through concealer, regardless of number of layers</li>
    <li> Use very little! If you use a lot it will give your skin a greenish tinge. If you use a little it corrects the red and makes the skin almost white, which is then easy to cover up with a natural color.</li>
    <li> totally gets rid of my red tones in my skin but a tiny dab goes a LONG way. you dont need much at all but i would recomend a moistersizer or primer first then concealer.</li>
    <li> I was kind of dissapointed, it looked more blue than anything. It fell heavy on the skin and not very smooth.</li>
    <li> Pretty good concealer</li>
    <li> I had a few (non raised/ flat) pimple scars that I wanted to conceal. I tried putting this stuff on before I actually used my concealer and it rubbed right off :/. I liked the concept, but this definitely did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I used to use the stick version, but the liquid version is much better. It really helps conceal imperfections, and works well with foundation!</li>

    <li> I have terrible redness on my cheeks and was told to try green concealer and this product used with my foundation blends my skin into a perfect porcelain color! Make sure moisturize well daily to help it go on smooth. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I loooooove this stuff! As someone who has acne, my skin is usually a nice splotchy red (this is due to just random red marks and not entirely the acne, and no, my skin is not affected by the face make up), and when i use one wand full of the concealer with some regular skin tone foundation on top, it does wonders to counter the redness of my pale skin and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is quite small, maybe the size of your ring finger, but it lasts months as you don&#x27;t need very much.

    <li> This concealer definitely countered the redness of my skin. It actually turned by skin a blueish/green tint.  Did not blend well.  Tried covering up the green tint with a tan foundation, as well as tan concealer.  Neither worked.  I have light tan skin, this was not a good product to cover up any redness or blemishes I had.</li>
    <li> Very creamy, easy to blend. You might need to build up a bit more concealer to hide the tint, but it works well and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This concealer really helps eliminate the acne. My skin is really  sensitive and im super fair but also have a red tone and it gets red easily especially when I have acne. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> ATTENTION TO MY GIRLS (OR GUYS) WHO HAVE DRY SKIN: BEWARE! This stuff will heavily highlight your dry areas and make your skin feel uncomfortable. Just a tip, I&#x27;d put a small bit of your foundation on first, then put a little more on top. A primer or moisturizer isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will-it will cover everything and knock out redness. However, unless you like the Elphaba-look, you will need to put on a lot of makeup over it to then cover over the greeness.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it very well. It&#x27;s highly pigmented so you only need a little bit of the product, which means it will last longer. It also conceals the red spots on my face nicely, without adding so much pigment that I look like a zombie and need a ton of foundation to cover up the green. It doesn&#x27;t melt away when I put the foundation over it either, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cakey on my face at all. I&#x27;m definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> I had some surgery and once the wounds healed, it left me with some bright red scars that were easily covered by this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m as fair skinned as they come.  To put it in perspective, I have to mix white foundation with my makeup because there is NO foundation on the market light enough for me.  High end or drugstore. But with being fair you also get redness, and it makes any foundation I put on look like I put a layer of pink on my face, regardless if it&#x27;s yellow tone, neutral, whatever. This green corrector is a must have for combating foundations that leave too much of a pink tone in addition to your natural redness.  Since this is a concealer, a little goes a long way and it is very pigmented.  This works WAY better than the potted version as this is more blendable and not cakey in the slightest.  Using this alone left my skin color completely neutralized and putting this on top of a pinker foundation helps tone it down a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I really love the NYX yellow concealer wand for under-eye circles, and I wanted to try this to even out a couple red spots. The problem is that the formula is much thicker than the yellow, and dries quickly, so if you don&#x27;t blend FAST you look like you didn&#x27;t quiiiiiiiite wash off a clay mask. :/</li>
    <li> It dries far too quickly. There&#x27;s no time to even it out or spread it. I threw it away.</li>
