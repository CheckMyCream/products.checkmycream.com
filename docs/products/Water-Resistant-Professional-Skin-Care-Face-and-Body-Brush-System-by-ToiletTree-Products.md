<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as powerful as I&#x27;d like - But fine</li>
    <li> product is great so far. Delivery service was right on time</li>
    <li> Love this product I recommend it to everyone get it</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase for my brother! Makes so much of a difference for him to scrub his face with this before he shaves!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m consistently surprised by the value proposition of this company. I&#x27;ve purchased multiple products from them and always pleased by the quality. This was no exception. I imagine that it may not work &amp;#34;quite&amp;#34; as well as a $200 model, but the question you should ask yourself is &amp;#34;Does the more expensive model work 20 times better than this?&amp;#34; I think the answer is certainly &#x27;no&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had this going now for 3 weeks on the same set of batteries in the shower and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I love the product . The people are great to work with fast and friendly. Any problems their on top of it fixing things . Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only has this for a few days, so I can&#x27;t say anything about durability.  The unit feels sturdy, though.  The brush heads are very nice.  I&#x27;ll probably use the soft heads most often, as I&#x27;m over 50, but the medium bristles are not too rough.  I appreciate that I can order replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> pumice stone broke after 8 uses. Other wise good product</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me this item as a gift a year ago. I liked it enough to reciprocate and give her one this year for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Have used it twice so far and my face feels so clean!  Have used the pumice stone on my feet--has really softened them up.  Also feels good to have not spent a fortune and to have been able to gift them to several other people because of the lower price.  Am trying to be gentle with the brushes to get as much use out of them as I can.  Haven&#x27;t looked into the replacement head costs yet.</li>
    <li> Love it except for the fact that the on/off switch locked in the on position today. I&#x27;ve had the product for less than two months!</li>
    <li> It is a solid spin brush. It is simple to use and gets the job done. The only thing is that it is big so it is not a good device for travelling.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes but it seems slow. I have noticed a different in my skin. I like the multiple heads, especially the pumice stone and the facial brush. The body brush seems to be the biggest problem but doesn&#x27;t seem work the price difference for the competitors. I suspect I like this due to the price I my ignorance of the competition.</li>
    <li> Previously bought 2 of these, for daughter and self, and liked it so much that bought this one for my son. Works well in and out of the shower. Only thing I dont like is the name, which is prominently printed on the item. Great selection of colors too.</li>
    <li> Works well compared to the more expensive models. Be aware you have to buy the case separately.</li>
    <li> I liked it very much, it has three heads, i liked the body brush because it&#x27; large, i have sensitive but oily skin, but i didn&#x27;t use the soft brush made for sensitive skin, i used the medium one and it worked very well for my face, after using it my skin feels very soft and glowing. The replacements are available and this is also good in case i needed one. It was delivered in few days, that was fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great product all around!  Definitely love the body brush the best, very soft, easy to use, and scrubs the dead skin off.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome product. I use it night and morning and my skin feels a lot smoother (I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend using it twice for those of you with sensitive skin). After each use, my skin feels squeaky clean:). I am very happy with this product and the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been wanting one for a long time, so I took a chance. What a great chance... I also got one for my husband for his birthday, since they were at a great price. (bought 2)  Not knowing if he would like it or even use it.  I love mine!!  My husband says he uses his every time he&#x27;s taking a shower... Very impressed, works great and at a great deal...  Thank you ToiletTree !!!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of my adult onset acne issues I have been struggling with for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got tired of relying on harsh chemical peroxide washes and scrubs.. This brush with a good exfoliating wash is really helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems well built and so far no issues. Only been a month though, but at more then 50% cheaper then some of the top brands you cannot go wrong .....</li>
    <li> been a week with it, totally beats using your hands every night, much more gentle, the body scrub works great but loses spinning torque the facial one is really good, used it in the shower and dropped it once from 5 feet high onto tile, still good no water leaking in.</li>
    <li> i have wanted a Clarisonic forever, but just couldn&#x27;t fork over the $200. read the reviews on this brush and thought for $40, why not. this little guy has power! a month in and i have clear, glowing skin. i don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this brush was definitely worthy.</li>
    <li> I really like the quality of this product for the price.  It is comparable to the more expensive face brushes,  which I have used in the past. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t plug in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, I use it to exfoliate after waxing mostly. Also, to clean my face.</li>
    <li> This vendor has been great in replacing defective units. I now have another...the on/off switches quit working. Real pain in the behind. This is probably the worst product I have purchased in my lifetime.</li>
    <li> Packing and shipping was fantastic, since this is my first time using item&#x27;s like these, as not much feedback I can give. I founded brush are. Too soft and they bend easy, am hang it when I&#x27;m done use, it has being second week by using factory battery s. Also has great handle grip, and docent make allot noise. It will be nice to come with travel pouch bag. But if you have to pay extra something should be included.</li>
    <li> To be honest  this product works great with the cleansers but the only thing I dind like was that it only has one speed</li>
    <li> Have had mine for a few months months it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Great to use in the shower. Was so happy with it I got one for my VERY hygienic very picky son-in-law ( I usually send him a gift card). He LOVED it!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for almost 2 weeks and she loves it! The soft face brush is perfect! This is a product that is worth the money paid!</li>
    <li> Great lower priced alternative to the clarisonic.  I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend as much on the clarisionic and after a few months I still really like this device.  Comes with great variety of attachments and is working for my skin - face and back.</li>
    <li> i have noticed a tremendous difference in my skin.  it&#x27;s softer and smoother than before.  overall, my face and body has a nice clean feel to it.  thank u.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. Excellent value and product. My skin stays velvety smooth.</li>
    <li> Despite requiring four batteries, this brush is a wimp. It only has one speed and that speed is SLOW. I have been using the Olay Pro-X cleansing system for a couple of years now. I really like it but was looking for something with various brush heads to keep in my shower. This product by ToiletTree really appealed to me because it included a body brush head. Unfortunately, it spins too slowly to be effective. The facial brush tugged on my skin (uncomfortable and not exactly helpful when trying to battle wrinkles) and the body brush and pumice stone just stopped completely whenever a small amount of pressure was applied. No pressure and no speed meant it took FOREVER just to clean my body, and it did a terrible job of exfoliating. I could have done it in half the time with my tiny Olay facial brush (it has two speeds, both of which are faster than this brush, and only takes two batteries). This is such a great concept with the four different brushes, but the execution falls short.</li>
    <li> I bought barely a 6 months ago and it has already died.  It&#x27;s not worth $35...  Update March 4,2015: The company kindly replaced the item, but the motor is not as fast as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Good, helps a lot. It fits just good with my cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as advertised and has a very powerful motor, taking 4 AA batteries. I would buy again. ( this having to have so many words makes me  think of High School and writing essays, what a joke)</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day. Gentle but effective. I accidentally left it in the shower a couple of times but it still works very well.</li>
    <li> Great product EXCEPT for battery housing.  I love this product but I am trying to change a battery and one of them is STUCK.  At first, 2 of them were stuck but I was able to get one out after an hour of trying different metal instruments (and ruining a battery).  Now there is one battery stuck.  I hope someone can help with this issue.</li>
    <li> I wanted to say that I bought one of these for my daughter for her B-day and realized that I needed one as well, it works great for body and face. What can I say, I have had no issues at all with either one that I bought, this is the perfect gift for anyone!</li>
    <li> I am happy with how soft the face brush is.  I have also used the body brush (which is more stiff) and I don&#x27;t have any issues with that brush, either.  I have not used the other two brushes, so, I cannot give an opinion on those.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are easy to pop off and on and the product works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the different brush options, I think it is a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time believing a generic product is just as good as its well advertised counterpart.  I took a chance on this one and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The price difference was too big to not give it a shot. You don&#x27;t need to spend $100 or more on a name. This brush does what you are looking for our to do.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is Everything advertised!</li>
    <li> This product is a real winner right here. It is far better than the similar [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X]] I had before. The build quality is excellent (feels very solid), and the power of its motor is substantially better than the Pro-X. I use the soft brush head for my face, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the feel and resultant effects from its habitual use. It&#x27;s been working really well with this [[ASIN:B00164DUY2 Acne.org 16 oz. Cleanser]] too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries were easy to get in and out of the device, and I&#x27;ve noticed that there are no traces of water slipping in (habitual shower use) through the sealed battery compartment. This is an important factor if you plan on using it while in the shower like I do. The Pro-X had traces of water always slipping in, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons why I had to find an affordable replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to order their specific replacement heads though, as the Pro-X heads DO NOT fit this device. Their medium brush head is similar to the stock Pro-X one, so I did try it out to be sure. Personally, I like how the soft brush head feels the most though, so I&#x27;ll happily order replacements here on amazon. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product for your whole body</li>
    <li> I love this product for numerous reasons.  First, it is recommended that you use a brush on cellulite to smooth it out, so this works wonders for that purpose.  Second, I have Keratosis Pilaris on my upper arms.  I use a gentle skin exfoliator on the body brush and apply it to both arms.  It has done a wonderful job of smoothing out those little bumps on my arms!  Third, I love the pumice attachment for my feet.  I have seen a significant difference after a week of use.  Fourth, what it does for my face is incredible.  You don&#x27;t need to apply an exfoliator to the face attachment, but you can if it&#x27;s a gentle one.  My skin is so incredibly smooth.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I use to use oily of olay face scrubber but it broke twice and II bought this one and what a difference. .This one is water proof. .you have extra brushes including a body brush ..I love it so much I told people at work..</li>
    <li> This skin care system is great. It works wonder and is reasonably priced. I use it every morning and evening. Love it</li>
    <li> The product worked very well until I had to change the batteries. Then we entered hell. The battery housing for this thing is undersized for what it should be. After several months of use it seemed that the battery housing had contracted somewhat and the internal batteries were freaking impossible to remove. The 2 closest to the opening came out but the other 2 batteries refused to move. This was after attempting to pry them out with numerous thin metallic instruments (every tweezer I owned), attempting to dislpodge them by hammering the device itself, and then finishing by tearing the outer shell open to try and find a better way into the battery housing. Guess what: no dice. So now I have 2 stuck batteries that are not coming and the housing itself is now busted. I would suggest purchasing one of the competitor devices until they fix this obvious design error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Upon seeing my issues with this face scrubbing, the nice folks at toilettree immediately reached out to me directly and happily sent me a new unit (at no cost) to replace my defective unit. I have since received it and it appears to be working perfectly. Time will tell if it holds out, but I must say I am impressed with their service. I am provisionally moving my review back up to a 4.</li>
    <li> ☆★☆I&#x27;m 39yr engaged to be married May 25, 2015, woman with 3 children. I have had more acne problems as an adult than i Did as a teenager. I&#x27;m mixed race with medium honey&lt;br /&gt;complexion &amp; oily skin. So when i get a scar, it turns into this dark fugly spot. I have a daily regimen &amp; routine for my skin care. I was raised &amp; tought to take good care of ur skin &amp; body, from the inside out. I unfortunately have a slight problem with picking at those awful fugly pimples that arise without invitation onto our beautiful faces.&lt;br /&gt;  ★This cleaning system is wonderful, just what i was looking for. I purchased one for myself &amp; my 16yr daughter. She absolutely loves it. I got the pastel purple, she got black. Both cleaning systems arrived quickly &amp; on time. The systems &amp; brushes were all packaged protectively an neatly. The system as well as brushes were all there &amp; in order.&lt;br /&gt;  ★I will do an update, but as of today I&#x27;ve used the cleansing system 6 times from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;It did come with 4 batteries, but i did replace the batteries with stronger rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;  ☆It does not feel rough on the face or body, Ive tried all the diffrnt brushes. So far I&#x27;ve tried them with cleanser, a mild &amp; gentle exfoliant, oil cleansing, and moisturizing. My face is looking amazing!! Less acne, scarring is diminishing, pores are so much smaller, my skin is&lt;br /&gt;brighter, clearer, smoother and even more beautiful than it was 7 days ago, lol.....&lt;br /&gt;  ★I do switch up between, honey, ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar), lemon &amp; sugar, Olay, vitamin C homemade cleanser, and oil cleansing. depending on what my face seems to be needing. I use ½ ACV-½ bottled water mixture as a toner, vitamin C serum as a Pre moisturizer/primer, then a non oily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;  ☆I take 10,000mcg of Biotin daily, along with a few other daily vitamins, aloe vera, fish oil, b12 &amp; a woman&#x27;s daily multi vitamin. I drink 2⅓-3 GALLONS of water a day!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right! lol, 3 gallons is what u just read.&lt;br /&gt;  ( yes, i potty alot! Lol sorry TMI)&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing i drink mayb once a day if that, is sugar free water enhancers. I Love my water, it&#x27;s just what taste amazing to me. All my kids are water drinkers as well. No soda or koolaid in this&lt;br /&gt;house. (That doesn&#x27;t mean i don&#x27;t enjoy my chocolate *smiles*)&lt;br /&gt;☆I understand not everyone feels that way, but, if a clear complexion Is what ur goal is, and vitamins an cleansers may not be in ur budget. Then drinking plenty of water is a safe, healthy way to go. Proper cleansing with less harsh cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;★ At first i thought this cleansing system was to slow &amp; not a hard enough circulation. &#x27;I WAS WRONG&#x27; (U know we just enjoy admitting we&#x27;re wrong.) Ok also, if u hold it and apply too much pressure while cleansing it&#x27;ll slow down. But, i finally got the hang of it, and with the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far, i can tell u that the brushes work perfectly beautifully! So make sure to read the directions, hold it properly and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure. It&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, i promise.&lt;br /&gt; ★ if by chance ur noticing ur skin is breaking out more, try an keep with it. All the impurities, toxins, oils, ect will come to the surface 1st. But after a 2 wks u will notice results, maybe not the results u want, but that&#x27;s where consistency plays a big role. None of that,&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;cleansing for 2 wks, break out an stop&#x27;. All that&#x27;s doing is restarting ur process over &amp; over again, without ever crossing over that hump to get urself that gorgeous clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget water!!! Its so important ladies &amp; gents!!&lt;br /&gt;★★ This cleansing system is well built, strong, its got some good weight to it. Not by any means cheap feeling. Fits in the hand really nicely. Its extremely easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering the travel case &amp; extra brushes today.&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★Yes, I highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt; I hope this helps somewhat. God Bless &amp; good luck.&lt;br /&gt; love, laughter, and gorgeous clear skin ♂♀&lt;br /&gt;EDIT😔Well the skin cleansing system worked well.  As of July 15, 2015 my system no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  while it works,  its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;•Helps with acne&lt;br /&gt;°Helps with scarring&lt;br /&gt;•Great for dark spots&lt;br /&gt;°Exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;•Has several uses an great at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Its slightly heavy,  nothing major or uncomfortable, just a bit weighty .&lt;br /&gt;• did not have a long life due to battery compartment . I used recharchable Duracell batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Changing the batteries was a tedious task.  The bottom 2 would get stuck deep inside,  an it didn&#x27;t matter how creative my husband an I got,  we could not get the last 2 batteries out.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased 2 systems.  1 for my daughter,  an same thing happened.  So,  basically , the system itself is wonderful,  if u don&#x27;t have to change the batteries.  I still keep my 5 star rating,  bcuz it does work well.  Imo the company should invest in a recharchable cleansing system.ger works.

    <li> This brush is so much better than all the ones I have used before.  Usually the motors aren&#x27;t strong enough to spin when the brush is against my face.  This brush is powerful and doesn&#x27;t slow down during cleaning.  I hang it in the shower and use it while showering.  It is totally waterproof and heavy duty.  I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> It seems to do a good job, it helps keep my hands off my face.</li>
