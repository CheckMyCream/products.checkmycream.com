      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>

      <li>I and my sister love it</li>
      <li>but I love the look.  </li>
      <li>ok.</li>

      <li>Ok, maybe it doesn&#x27;t clump on someone else...</li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>free to leave me feedback!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Great Lash for years and loved it, but for some reason my eyes now itch and become very red after using it.</li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>The trick is to apply many many many brush strokes.</li>
      <li>This is my most favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>better than any fancy mascara I have tried.</li>
      <li>The brush is a perfect size to help reach those tiny eyelashes in the corner of your eye.</li>
      <li>I get one shipped to my house every 6 weeks for healthy lashes.</li>
      <li>Decent sub for GIvenchy Eye Fly.  </li>
      <li>long beautiful lashes in seconds!!</li>
      <li>Although you can easily get it at a drug store, I use this staple of my beauty routine as a &#x27;filler&#x27; to bump my Amazon order up to the amount to get free shipping!</li>
      <li>current favorite, nice slim line brush with excellent results, it really lengthens lashes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It clumps and flakes off easily and also creates &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; for me.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub off too easily or flake either.</li>
      <li>If clumping made a sound, it might sound like the word :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t remove easy for me, which I like.</li>
      <li>the best mascara that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  </li>
      <li>hands down one of the best INEXPENSIVE mascaras on the market.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine if your just looking for a run of the mill mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a huge mascara addict, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens and dozens of them over the years.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth without clumping.  </li>
      <li>This mascara compares quite nicely to brands which cost 4 times as much.  </li>
      <li>It is for me because I am cheap and not wasteful.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara right now.</li>
      <li>It is of very good quality, does not leave lumps when applied, it gives volume to the lashes and makes them look a little longer.</li>
      <li>I have a happy medium of sexy natural looking lashes without applying falsies, applying a ton of product or spending big bucks!</li>
      <li>love the brush..... really separates my eyelashes</li>
      <li>I like this way more than my high end mascaras.</li>
      <li>It is waterproof- you will need more than normal soap and water to remove it at the end of the day-</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on easy and the brush really separates my lashes</li>
      <li>There is so much I can say about this product, I have been using it for years!!</li>
      <li>I also like that the formula is more wet than many mascara&#x27;s</li>
      <li>the only kind I will spend my money on.</li>
      <li>If applied right, it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
      <li>Never paid too much attention to it, Just used q-tips to clean it.</li>
      <li>good long mascara but very noticeable</li>
      <li>No need to pay big bucks for pricey department store brands; this is a really nice mascara reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Once applied, my lashes have great color, they appear long and nice and thick.</li>
      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my original bottle for about six weeks, and it still applies like new.</li>
      <li>Looks pretty.</li>
      <li>This is the best mascara I have ever used- even compared to expensive products.  </li>
      <li>I used the regular Voluminous for years until this came out, and this one is even better.</li>
      <li>funny word, isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
      <li>at a higher price point.  </li>
      <li>absolutely recommend this product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I expected a little more volume.</li>
    <li> Amplifies lashes and works better than expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the BEST!  Thickens lashes without clumping them.  It&#x27;s the only brand I buy.  Thanks To Amazon I get it on auto delivery so that I&#x27;m never out of it!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> great mascara for a good price</li>
    <li> This mascara compares quite nicely to brands which cost 4 times as much.  I get plenty of color and a noticeable but not exaggerated difference in length and volume.  Decent sub for GIvenchy Eye Fly.  I switched to this brand from Rimmel Scandaleyes, which applied very clumpy after only a week&#x27;s use.  I&#x27;ve had my original bottle for about six weeks, and it still applies like new.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this mascara! It makes my lashes long, and thick. It is quite black in the carbon shade, which I love!  Two coats and you are good to go!  I also like that the formula is more wet than many mascara&#x27;s I have used , I like a more glossy look. It dries fast and does no clump or smudge.  What a great drugstore mascara!</li>
    <li> I have used many, many kinds of mascara, both drug store brands as well as department store brands.  I bought this mascara because it was the one they used on Project Runway and wanted to try it.  It isn&#x27;t any different than all of the other cheapy mascara out there, &amp; it does not do what it advertises.  Of ALL of the mascara that I have tried in my life, (which is about 20 years now, &amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascara that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> On the advice of a beauty blogger I bought this along with the other voluminous mascara, also in carbon black. Alone this mascara was underwhelming. It was OK, but nothing that totally blew me away. But coupled with the other voluminous mascara, WOW! Combined I looked like I had false lashes on (in the good way). I will continue buying them as a pair as long as I can because this makes even the high end expensive mascaras look wimpy.</li>
    <li> Perfect and no clumping</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this mascara. It clumps and flakes off easily and also creates &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and I&#x27;ll never buy another kind again, now that I&#x27;ve found it. Never clumps, ever. Looks pretty. I use non-waterproof because it&#x27;s not as harsh and drying on your lashes, and this kind doesn&#x27;t end up smudged under your eyes after a day of activity, like some do. Also, it smells like roses.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It is of very good quality, does not leave lumps when applied, it gives volume to the lashes and makes them look a little longer.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this to break the pattern of always buying the same mascara that I have for decades.  I thought spending more for a fancier brand would be treating myself to a better product.  Wow I was wrong!  I seriously regret that decision! Within a couple of weeks I questioned the shortening and thinning of my eyelashes.  By the 3rd week it was becoming very clear this was happening.  I had noticed the consistency of the dried mascara on my lashes was dry and brittle and it was making my eyelashes brittle. They were breaking off with any kind of contact. Horrible.  Now I can hardly see my stubby little eyelashes.  The tube hit the trash.  I am going to look for a nourishing healthy mascara and with research have learned its going to take 4-6 months for them to grow back enough to notice a difference.  I am REALLY unhappy!!!</li>
    <li> good long mascara but very noticeable that you&#x27;ve applied mascara. If you want unnoticeable mascara try any one of almay&#x27;s mascaras. Nonetheless good for parties and events, etc.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t flake. You don&#x27;t get the weird five huge eyelashes thing. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth without clumping.  Separates lashes well.  Washes off with a warm damp rag.  Comparable to higher priced mascaras.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara was perfect for me.  It made my lashes look long and natural and did not cake up.  I&#x27;m a contact lens wearer and this product did not irritate my eyes at all.  I would order it again!</li>
    <li> I have blonde long lashes that have a slight curl to them, but extremely sensitive eyes. I really need a thinner formula black mascara that is made for sensitive eyes. L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Carbon Black went on extremely thick and made my lashes clump together. I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Great Lash for years and loved it, but for some reason my eyes now itch and become very red after using it. The search is still on...</li>
    <li> No need to pay big bucks for pricey department store brands; this is a really nice mascara reasonably priced.  The brush does not clump; and using daily it will last a month before it gets skimpy.  Although you can easily get it at a drug store, I use this staple of my beauty routine as a &#x27;filler&#x27; to bump my Amazon order up to the amount to get free shipping!</li>
    <li> this one I got for my Dougther, she love it, make her lasher very long looking, she like it so much I had to buy it for her several times</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara! Adds thickness and length - I&#x27;ve tried lots of other brands, both drugstore and high end, and this is still a favorite. I used the regular Voluminous for years until this came out, and this one is even better. The brush is awesome, and I actually get asked if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. It does AMAZING things with multiple coats - wait a few minutes between so the first coat can dry, and then put on a second one. Stunning lashes!</li>
    <li> love loreal mascaras…makes the eyes look great…only problem, it shreds off after a few-many hours..</li>
    <li> love the brush..... really separates my eyelashes</li>
    <li> I use this religiously, it is wonderful, it extends my eyelashes and separates them. The trick is to apply many many many brush strokes. Only dip the applicator once or twice but keep combing your lashes to apply it evenly and lengthen them. I get one shipped to my house every 6 weeks for healthy lashes.</li>
    <li> There is so much I can say about this product, I have been using it for years!! It gives you volume like expect from a mascara. Never spend too much on mascara I like this way more than my high end mascaras. Trust me this product is awsome!</li>
    <li> hands down one of the best INEXPENSIVE mascaras on the market.  long beautiful lashes in seconds!! absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> These are fake. Not the real ones. I&#x27;ve been using loreal million lashes for few years now and as soon as I got these I knew they were fake. They don&#x27;t look exactly the same and there is a weird smell when I first opened it. Very disappointed cause I bought few not only one</li>
    <li> Great price and convenient way of purchasing a commonly used item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this mascara.  I have no complaints.  It does not irritate my eyes and does not smear.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose and does a good job.  I thought the price was affordable and very good, too.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and i use it every day it is one of the best mascaras i have ever used! Definitely recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara just didn&#x27;t seem like it was any different than the rest to me. I think that I have become spoiled by two other mascaras that are my favorites, but I have fallen in love with the Loreal hair care product line, especially the Ever series, and thought that I would try their mascara too. Think that I will stick to the hair care products. It&#x27;s fine if your just looking for a run of the mill mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump when I apply it. I had tried other brands, but I seem to keep coming back to L&#x27;Oreal brands.</li>
    <li> Me llego la compra en la fecha prometida y el producto fue exactamente el que solicite, en buen estado, lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I love using trying different mascaras and play up my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this mascara, it makes my lashes thick and full. It has a really nice \\&quot;rubbery\\&quot; wand and doesn&#x27;t make them clump.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very build-able but it takes some time to dry so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to leave me feedback!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal is the best OTC cosmetic line in the world.  Love all of their products and have never been disappointed.  I use this mascara and people swear that my lashes are not mine!!  They can&#x27;t believe how long and full my lashes are as a result of using this product.  Fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had mascara that gave my lashes as much natural looking volume and density as this product.  It does go on with very liquid texture and it does leave clumps, but it is so worth a little cleanup and work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t require a lot of application&lt;br /&gt;- Gradient of thickness is natural looking with application&lt;br /&gt;- Can achieve look of fake lashes without applying actual fake lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave lashes looking super fake, chunky, and messy like other products leave when&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Product does have thin liquid texture upon application&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to transfer to eye lid if you don&#x27;t give it enough time to dry&lt;br /&gt;- Does leave some clumps and it will be hard to get out if you don&#x27;t feather it fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look like I have fake lashes just with a little application.  With other mascaras, if you apply a lot of product to get thick lashes it ends up looking chunky and messy.  With this stuff the thick lashes have more natural gradient of thickness like false lashes.  I hate applying false eye lashes but I love the look.  That&#x27;s mostly why I love this stuff.  I have a happy medium of sexy natural looking lashes without applying falsies, applying a ton of product or spending big bucks!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried plenty.  It goes on smoothly, without clumping, thickens my lashes, and comes off using a wet washcloth, but never smears or flakes when I&#x27;m wearing it.  Love it.</li>
    <li> it is very good quality. Wife bought gifts for her friends. They are delighted with the quality. thank you very much</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t runoff this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a couple of years, but in the end of the day I always had black mascara smears under my eyes. I thought that my skin must be too greasy thus I have mascara under my eyes on my skin. Never paid too much attention to it, Just used q-tips to clean it. Recently, I tried different kind of mascara and that mascara stays on at all times without smears under my eyes. I guess, it was Voluminous mascara fault rather than my skins greasiness level.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used. It was recommended to me by a friend and I haven&#x27;t looked back since! I have experimented with all different brands of mascara over the years and none cover your eyelashes the way Voluminous Million Lashes does. As a former Mary Kay consultant, I love makeup and trying out new products. I use every other makeup product from Mary Kay, with the exception of this mascara. The brush is a perfect size to help reach those tiny eyelashes in the corner of your eye. I can definitely tell a difference in the fullness of my eyelashes as well. My eyelashes don&#x27;t stick or clump together after applying. I love this product and will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara right now. I think it does an incredible job of darkening my lashes &amp; lengthening them, all while not clumping. It doesn&#x27;t rub off too easily or flake either. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand of mascara for a couple years now. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments on my lashes, the mascara makes them long and creates volume.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of times people ask if I have on false lashes. I recommend 100%.</li>
    <li> My lashes are short, thin and light blonde.  This is the best mascara I have ever used- even compared to expensive products.  Once applied, my lashes have great color, they appear long and nice and thick. I find that the carbon black looks better with my lighter complexion (as opposed to the blackest black).  This stays on all day- it doesn&#x27;t smudge or run.  If applied right, it doesn&#x27;t clump.  It is waterproof- you will need more than normal soap and water to remove it at the end of the day- I find make-up remover works ok. I love this mascara</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite mascara. I will not use any other. Doesn&#x27;t clump. Thickens and lengthens. better than any fancy mascara I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge mascara addict, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens and dozens of them over the years.  THIS is the BEST I&#x27;ve found.  I don&#x27;t think it can get any better!  100% recommended!</li>
    <li> I Love these mascara, and it is very good ,I have not long eyelashes and it works well. I and my sister love it</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised. I love L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that I will ever use. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I was blessed by God and my parents with lucious lashes of my own, but they aren&#x27;t really dark... at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara gives me the best look that I&#x27;ve come across when it comes to mascaras. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of the drugstore brands and nothing comes close to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy and the brush really separates my lashes so I don&#x27;t have to sit there and pay so much attention to detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t remove easy for me, which I like. I cry, it doesn&#x27;t budge. I go swimming, it doesn&#x27;t budge. I sleep, it only slightly budges, but it&#x27;s not good to sleep with makeup on anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can apply 1 coat for an everyday look, and 2 coats for a more dramatic look. The photos show only 1 coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does respond well to makeup remover wipes. Only then, depending on if you&#x27;re using a quality brand, does the mascara remove with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply adore the effects and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> super dark, long lashes, not too thick, not clumpy. flakes after hour 8.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to read some of the rave reviews for this mascara &amp; had to double check I was writing on the correct product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Mascara is terrible; it doesn&#x27;t give volume or lengthen whatsoever. Within a few uses, it was extremely flaky and I have to keep washing the brush to get rid of all the bits. It doesn&#x27;t separate the lashes at all, so you end up with about 4 lashes all glued together.  The brush is also quite chunky and clumsy to use, especially if you want to coat the top of your upper lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is overpriced for the quality of the product, IMO. I think you are paying for the fancy glitzy case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, as someone who has tried hundreds of Mascaras (&amp; here is just another money waster), save your money and try something different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are two that I can recommend and I will continue to use unless something more spectacular comes along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current favorite, nice slim line brush with excellent results, it really lengthens lashes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Stiletto-Ultimate-Washable-Mascara/dp/B002ZTZVC6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1359632347&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;lash+stilleto+mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another one I use - with nice defined brush with good results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Define-A-Lash-Lengthening-Washable-Mascara/dp/B000W9WZ34/ref&#x3D;sr_1_35_m?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1359632494&amp;sr&#x3D;1-35&amp;keywords&#x3D;mascara</li>
    <li> I have purchased every mascara at every price point and keep coming back to this one.  Just as good ... and better than most .... at a higher price point.  Everyone raves about the department store brands, but this one has them beat.  No running, no clumping, makes my lashes look great, etc.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, doesn&#x27;t clump, love it!</li>
    <li> Makes for long lashes.</li>
    <li> the only kind I will spend my money on. love it!</li>
    <li> Ok, maybe it doesn&#x27;t clump on someone else... but for my incredibly average lashes (medium thickness, medium length) this clumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLUMP CLUMP CLUMP... funny word, isn&#x27;t it?  If clumping made a sound, it might sound like the word :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my experience with this mascara is that it does clump.  No, it is not horrible and awful and embarrassing to wear it.  It takes some effort to correct the clumping with a brush (not the applicator) but with adding the TINIEST smudge (another funny word) of Vaseline on my lashes before applying the mascara makes it not terribly hard to brush out the clumps.  It adds 2 extra steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding 2 extra steps isn&#x27;t for everyone.  It is for me because I am cheap and not wasteful.  I can&#x27;t throw out a new container of makeup and go buy another one without guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, ladies and others, you could try this... but according to the other reviews, it sounds like it&#x27;s better for thick lashes.  Do you have thick lashes?</li>
    <li> Goes on like a boss. But this formula is a little flakey on me. And by the end of the day I have raccoon eyes because bits begin to shed from my eyelashes.</li>
