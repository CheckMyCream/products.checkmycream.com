<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST! Smells great and it leaves my hair soft enough that I don&#x27;t need conditioner. I have lots of fine hair that&#x27;s maybe 2 inches past my shoulder, and I don&#x27;t need very much of this to cover my head. The bottle seems pretty small, but one bottle lasted me from July to October with everyday use. The consistency is super thick (makes me think of honey) and takes a bit to come out of the bottle, but I only generally use about a quarter sized bit. It also does a decent job of dealing with oil as well. The price is a bit high, but for how long it lasts, how nice it smells and how well it works I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> great smell in the shower; odorless once rinsed and dry.  lather is the best.  no perfume smell which is great.</li>
    <li> the smell isn&#x27;t potent however it smells good and it only stays as a lather for about 20 sec and then it looses it foaminess and you need to add more to your hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo it all natural. No chemicals. This is perfect for processed hair. It can be used daily . Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Really great everyday shampoo for men &amp; woman. Yes ladies- it&#x27;s not just for men! I have long hair and it&#x27;s and amazing product :)</li>
    <li> Beer and shampoo. How can you go wrong?  This shampoo absolutely is the best shampoo I have ever used. It smells good, lasts a long time, lathers up rich, and makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Good foam, interesting but good smell. Unique product. Very thick gel, found it easier to put in a travel squeeze bottle to make it easier to pour</li>
    <li> Brought this for my sister and it is good on hair. It is nice that there is no wierd smell.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. Smells great and leaves my hair feeling wonderful. I love it and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS EXCELLENT ....DOES NOT SMELL LIKE BEER...HAS A PLEASANT SCENT...LATHERS UP EXCELLENT..LEAVES HAIR FEELING EXTREMELY CLEAN.....A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY..WELL WORTH THE MONEY..CONDITIONER  ALSO EXCELLENT....HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of this shampoo but it sounded interesting, I love beer and clean hair. I tried it out and it left my fine hair soft, shiny but also with some volume. I really love the smell of if as well. Buy some, try it out! It made my hoppy :)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend so much on a shampoo, but I&#x27;d been wanting to go the natural route for a while. After trying this, I can say that I&#x27;ll probably never go back to drug-store shampoos ever again. This shampoo creates the perfect balance of moisture and volume for my hair. I even feel like it extends the time between hair washes. My only gripe is that with the amount of hair that I have and its thickness, it is really hard to work the shampoo into my scalp because it has very little lather, due to its natural ingredients &amp; lack of harsh chemicals. So I end up having to use a ton of this stuff and having to really take the time to massage it in. But, the results are worth it every time. I hardly have to style my hair after washing with this. It smooths out most of my frizz without making my hair a greasy/oily mess the next day. I pair this shampoo with its conditioner for the best results, which I also highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It smells amazing and leaves my hair soft and shiny, and with lots of volume. Must admit that I was a bit skeptical at first, but boy was I surprised at how healthy my hair looks and feels. I would recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my first shampoo review so you&#x27;ll have to bear with me. As a craft beer enthusiast, I had heard about this product and wanted to give it a try. The smell from this shampoo is really awesome. It smells like a combination of honey, vanilla, and malts (I believe) that I didn&#x27;t find overpowering or &amp;#34;unmanly&amp;#34; at all. I have pretty short hair and was able to get a good lather going unlike some of the other reviewers. The shampoo hasn&#x27;t dried out my scalp at all and I even tried it on my beard with similarly great results.</li>
    <li> It really does. I don&#x27;t know that it cleans my hair any better than the old Suave stuff I was using (the 2 buck chuck of shampoo) but it&#x27;s all natural, smells a lot better and comes in a nice classy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My GF has a strict policy against &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; style shampoo or body wash since they all tend to be horrible and overpowering like cheap cologne. I tend to agree, and this is as far from that as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning if you&#x27;re considering buying this: I expect it will be difficult to go back to the suave after getting used to this stuff. So if you&#x27;re considering the upgrade, you&#x27;re really not just making a 20 dollar (or whatever) decision, you&#x27;re also making that decision for every time you buy shampoo in the future. Unless I go before my time, I expect this has now cost me a few grand.</li>
    <li> I hate to be the lone mediocre review, but I guess I have to be. First of all, this shampoo does smell absolutely fantastic, and the packaging is great too. I wish I could keep using it for those two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have thick and rather oily hair, and yet this is the only shampoo I can remember trying that dried my hair out considerably and had people asking me why my hair looked so dry. For that reason I can&#x27;t justify continuing to use it, but man did it smell good. Really, really good.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant smell. It does not smell like beer to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy on the hair and skalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but this product is worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Have tried several shampoos for my hard and thick hair and this one beats all others in retaining the softness for hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree...VERY good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using conditioner after starting this product and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I am surprised that no one has commented on the thickness of the shampoo and the bottle it is in. It is EXTREMELY hard to get the stuff OUT of the bottle! You have to squeeze really hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an unfortunate reminder every time I shower.</li>
    <li> This product does not have any artificial smells or residue left behind.  My hair has actually grown faster since starting to use this.  I have been using it for just over a year.  I have given it as gifts to other friends and they love it.  Sulfate and paraben free makes this salon quality.  I love the suds, the conditioner goes a long way...learned the first time I don&#x27;t need as much as I would with another brand.  Lastly, and this is very important to me, it is never tested on animals....WIN WIN WIN all the way around.  I recommend this to people all the time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is outstanding.  My hair has never felt so clean and manageable!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo(great smell/quality), but it&#x27;s soooooo thick and hard to get out of the container. Beware if you have any kind of hand strength issue.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells great, leaves hair soft, and has a manly bottle to boot.</li>
    <li> This smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t have any of the scalp damaging sulfates. However, it is not a chemical free product if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it just isn&#x27;t worth paying so much more for this product.</li>
    <li> My wife is a hair stylist and brought home some of this shampoo. I usually used any store bought shampoo. I will never go back! My hair is healthier, shinny and easy to style! The smell is fantastic and I love the nostalgic bottle. I would recommend this to anyone.  UPDATE: Still a fantastic product, I would recommend this to any guy looking for a better shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is a pricey little item that I would not buy regularly, but I included it in my boyfriend&#x27;s stocking last year as a fun item. I snuck a sample one day whilst showering and was quite happy with it. As an added bonus, it is made with Elysian. Yay for Washington beer!</li>
    <li> I like it. I don&#x60;t have to use hair conditioner and after using this shampoo I have a few hairs left in the bathtub, when using regular chemical shampoo I have way more hair in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I was looking for: beer based and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. Women love the smell and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is not the miracle shampoo- it is okay - but that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> Stuff smelled ok, and it was in a nice bottle. But it arrived open with the cap off and it was all over the box. Hahah used shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love their original shampoo and conditioner, but not this version. Unfortunately, I will not be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original - the smell was nice sort like coconut/vanilla and it worked great and the price was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this doesn&#x27;t display &#x27;Verified Purchase&#x27;, if I placed an order on May 26, 2013 .</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to state that I&#x27;ve used this shampoo, and really liked it until I started looking at the ingredients list.  They use cocamide DEA, which has been found to be carcinogenic. If they could substitute non-carcinogenic ingredients, I&#x27;d start purchasing this product again in a minute.</li>
    <li> I first tried &#x27;beer shampoo&#x27; in India where I lived for a short while and this product was the closest thing I could find when I got back to the states. I keep telling my friends &amp;#34;Beer is great for your hair!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. You only need a little for it to do the job.</li>
    <li> Suds up great and it does make your hair feel ok but for my natural kinky hair by the end of the day my hair is hard so I would only use this with lots of moisturize</li>
    <li> I have seen thicker &amp; stronger hair after using this shampoo for 2 weeks. I use it every other day. Works great. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> As someone who loves craft beer, trying a beer shampoo was a natural choice.  My first experience was with a different brand also sold on amazon, but I am extremely glad to have found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is a tad expensive for the amount you receive, but do not allow that to put you off from trying it.  It is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried and it practically eliminates the need for a conditioner.  My hair feels super soft and healthy after only using this product for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-makes my hair feel amazing.  seriously.&lt;br /&gt;-smells great&lt;br /&gt;-looks like a normal shampoo (unlike some other beer shampoos)&lt;br /&gt;-uses beer from Elysian Brewing Company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, just try it.  You will thank yourself later.</li>
    <li> I have medium thick, long and shiny hair to start with. They are naturally dark brown and I have never used color on my hair. 3 years back I went through a chemical straitening process in India as to make them softer.I used to use matrix biolage for years. This shampoo stopped working after they changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several shampoos in last year but nothing was suitable. I tried park avenue beer shampoo at my cousins place while I was in India. It worked wonder on my hair leaving them soft shiny and conditioned. I could not get that here in US so I thought to give this shampoo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1st wash I realized that my hair became dry. I do not appreciate the scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it once and returning it.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo itself, I just wish it came in a better bottle. Every bottle I get seems to leak. As such, don&#x27;t be surprised by oozing shampoo when you open the package. Also, be careful if you take this product when you travel. Additionally, it is difficult to squeeze the bottle the right way to get the shampoo to come out when the bottle is half-empty. This problem is exacerbated by the thickness of the product. However, the smell of the shampoo is great and does leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones and this one seems to suit me perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily.  Just clean and soft.  It lathers up exceptionally well, even with cold water, as I take only cold showers.  You won&#x27;t need much to get a super lather going from this shampoo!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever experienced a shampoo that lathers as nicely as this one.  The shampoo has sort of a syrup-like consistency to it.  Not thin and watery by any means and certainly not like your typical shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Duffy&#x27;s Brew is one of my favourite sulphate free shampoos.  Makes my hair shiny and cleans my scalp well.  I highly recommend this product.  However, the boyfriend tried it and it made him break out in a rash, so perhaps not good for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  Just a little goes a long way.  It has a very pleasing smell.  one minor thing: it&#x27;s really hard to squeeze the bottle to get the shampoo to come out.  EDIT: So, I had ordered the Broo shampoo too, and after going through my bottle I&#x27;m returning to Duffy&#x27;s.  The Broo is easier to get out of the bottle, but doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as nice.  I just store the Duffy&#x27;s upside down to be able to squeeze it out easier.</li>
    <li> He first received this as a a kind of gag gift at Christmas, but tried it and liked how it made his hair soft.  So, I&#x27;m buying it now on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> Yum! You will get drunk from the smell! It is absolutely delicious but it dries my hair a bit too harsh so I use it occasionally.  Do buy their conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Cleans well and gives my hair lots of volume.  Love the smell - not at all like beer.  it&#x27;s very thick (store the bottle upside-down) and a little gies a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo so much that I even use it as body soap  and wash my dog with it! I just wish they made deodorant, cologne and shaving cream. I will be a customer for life. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows beer makes your belly happy.  Now Duffy&#x27;s Beer Shampoo makes my hair happy too.  It lathers well and smells clean and fresh.  It left my hair feeling silky and smooth and definitely exceeded my expectations.  My husband and twin boys loved it as well.  They even asked me to continue buying it! Great product...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo-more body to my hair.</li>
    <li> this will be the only shampoo and also the Duffys brew conditioner, I will ever use again, the smell is intoxicating, it is so original and well crafted, this is truly a 5 star product</li>
    <li> Was a bit skeptical at first but this shampoo is the bomb!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a dry scalp for years - stylists and doctors always told me it was dandruff, but the dandruff shampoos, even prescription ones did nothing to resolve the problem... some even made it worse.  I have very, very - did I say, very - thick wavy black - now with some grey - hair.  Despite liking it long, I wore it super short and spiked for almost 11 years so that I could wash it every day without having to further irritate my scalp by blowdrying, etc. or waiting literally hours for it to dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I lived with the itchy scalp... always having to control myself from scratching like a flea-bitten dog! If you can relate, you know it does detract and distract from whatever you&#x27;re doing because the itch is constant and you are always aware of it.  Then, several month ago, my daughter found and introduced me to Lush natural soaps, etc. and while I LOVE their products, they are much too rich for my pocket book, especially since I have to use more shampoo to penetrate my thick hair. They recommended their Cynthia Stout beer shampoo and for the first time in my memory, my scalp did not itch! A miracle in a very small expensive bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I was going to have to give up Cynthia Stout at $20/3 oz bottle (purchased only once/got barely 3 uses out of it), but I was not willing to give up the no-itch scalp or my now longer hair - so I did the sensible thing and searched on Amazon!  Certainly someone else out there made non-sulfate, non etc., beer shampoo! (Hmmm, I just remembered my grandmother telling me to use beer to rinse my hair for better shine but I never liked the smell of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of other reviewers I selected Duffy&#x27;s Brew ESB Craft Beer Shampoo. YAY! In a 12 oz bottle! YAY! For $18! YAY! On Prime! YAY!!  It is milder smelling than Cynthia Stout which is a bonus although some might still not like it.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, besides once you apply the conditioner you can&#x27;t smell it anyway. I almost don&#x27;t need conditioner and other reviewers don&#x27;t need it, but as I said, my hair is very thick so I do.  I&#x27;ve paired it with non-sulfate Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Conditioner (see separate review) and my hair is fabulously soft and untangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duffy&#x27;s Brew has eliminated my itchy, embarrassingly flaky scalp and helps make my hair shiny and soft.  I hope it works as well for you as it does for me!  :-)conditioner and other reviewers don&#x27;t need it, but as I said, my hair is very thick so I do.

    <li> Smells good n good for ur hair</li>
    <li> First time user.......love it I will ore than likely purchase this product again in the future when I run out</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It lathers great. It leaves my hair feeling soft. And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling like beer. The only complaint I have is the bottle is really difficult to use. The plastic is hard to squeeze so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get the product out.</li>
    <li> It has made my hari fuller and cleaner looking.  it has been reliable I cannot wait for them to come out with conditioner</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - I&#x27;ve tried both this and the IPA shampoo, love them both.  A bottle lasts a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This is my second day using Duffy&#x27;s Brew shampoo and I love it. My long curls look amazing. I will be purchasing this shampoo regularly as it is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I have thin limp hair that i&#x27;ve been trying to grow for a more modern style. I was getting discouraged due to the fact that it is so limp and flat, and was getting ready to cut it short again. Until I discovered this wonderful product! OMG my hair seems so full and healthy just after using this shampoo for 3 days in a row. It is worth every cent for the results it gave me.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this shampoo. It smells divine and even though I only wash my hair once a week, it cleanses it really well. It cuts through the products I use and makes my hair feel super soft and a little goes a long way! I buy this from a local salon, so the price is much better as well.</li>
    <li> Sorry guys, no real beer smell and it dries my hair out. I&#x27;m stealing my girlfriends Ogx coconut shampoo instead. At the end of the day I just want soft and smooth hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo! It smells good, makes my hair shiny and suds up nice...&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact is has no sulfates.:-)Now I&#x27;m just waiting for the conditioner to go with it. Than I can write a review on that. I will purchase this shampoo again...</li>
    <li> I use this on my beard - due to the moisturizing ingredients it works better than most shampoos which will just dry it out. Smells pretty close to beer - Im glad it isnt a strong artificial smell - just smells good. My girlfriend loves it considering she loves beer and beards.. lol!</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase, recommended to friends. and on top of everything great customer service. I got contacted by them in a very professional manner.</li>
    <li> * leaves my hair soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;* does not dry my scalp&lt;br /&gt;* suds very well&lt;br /&gt;* smells very nice&lt;br /&gt;* no SLS and no colors (that is amazing how many shampoo and shower gel manufacturers use artificial coloring agents in their product)&lt;br /&gt;* my hair does not need any conditioner after this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You get it all in one bottle :)</li>
    <li> Love that the ingredients are natural, makes hair look and smell great.  My husband especially loves it. I have ordered it three times and will definitely continue buying this great product.  Only wish the bottles were bigger!</li>
    <li> It smells excellent! Lathers up better than any other sulfate free shampoo I have used. The only issue I have with it is that it really does dry my scalp. I did notice that with daily use this tendency has reduced.</li>
    <li> Hey, I was a little hesitant at first -- is this just another gimmicky product?  But then I tried it and found it to be really fantastic!  Fresh, clean smell and great results.  I think the best thing about this shampoo is that it does not overpower you with artificial scents and perfumes -- just a great clean, natural smell.  Highly recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0047YYHDQ Duffy&#x27;s Brew Original Beer Conditioner - 8oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long color treated hair.  I started using Duffy&#x27;s Brew Shampoo and Conditioner and have received many compliments on my hair from people whom have seen me frequently.  The ONLY change I have made is using this product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, smells amazing (like hoppy cinnamon rolls) and leaves your hair with that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling that is so enjoyable. 5/5</li>
    <li> I was referred to this shampoo from a relative of mine, and being a sucker for Amazon Prime, decided to order it and have to say that I&#x27;m really happy I did. I love the smell of the shampoo and the lather is extremely rich and soft. I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time now but it left my hair feeling really clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the shampoo and the conditioner and was very pleased with both products. There was no smell of beer at all and just a little produces a lot of lather! The conditioner works well to tame my colored, often flyaway hair! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This may be a good shampoo, but it comes with a very very strong perfumee smell. If you like strong grandma smelling perfume scent, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> i feel like this shampoo strips my hair a little. now i switched to aveeno i like aveeno better with more moisturizer. Duffy&#x27;s boasts beer in its ingredients, but is beer good or bad for the hair? nobody knows. im on the fence about this shampoo. wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best shampoo I have ever used!!!  I was given a bottle of shampoo and conditioner for my birthday.  And honestly I was skeptical (beer in my hair care products seemed a little funny to me)...but this stuff is AWESOME.  I have long hair and I&#x27;m a stay at home mom so I don&#x27;t have the time to wash my hair everyday anymore, and when I use this shampoo my hair looks freshly washed for days.  When I have a chance to set/curl my hair, it holds so well I don&#x27;t even need to use sticky hairspray which makes me happy.  It even smells great (even if you don&#x27;t drink beer lol!)  Plus it is really thick shampoo so a little goes a loooooong way- so when I went to purchase my 2nd bottle (and 3rd and 4th...) I thought it&#x27;s totally worth the price point because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find shampoo made with beer, no less, that made my frizzy colored hair feel clean and shiny. I was skeptical at first but the shampoo really works in controlling hair that is damaged with chemicals. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! A friend recommended it. It arrived yesterday and I used it for the first time today. It lathers up very thick and rich. Now my flowing auburn locks with natural platinum highlights are full and luxurious. And I feel pretty and witty and gay. Okay, only kidding about the pretty witty gay stuff but this is a great shampoo.</li>
