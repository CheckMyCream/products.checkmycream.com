    <li> I received this VERY SMALL product after just a few days and I noticed on the back of the box it says. &amp;#34;not for individual sale.&amp;#34; I am not sure if it is legal to be selling this product. Other than that, I love the smell and enjoy wearing it. The only problem I have is there is no spray application or roller ball. You just put your finger over the top, turn it upside down and apply it that way. I am afraid I am going to drop it one day and that will be the end it.</li>
    <li> Great scent for any young woman.  Purchased as a gift and it was a great gift, the only downside was the price that this particular brand goes for.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, dont last long, it is watered down. Wont buy it again, to pricey an you have to keep putting it on</li>
    <li> Too expence and too small</li>
    <li> A beautiful fragrance!</li>

    <li> This is the BEST smelling perfume ever.  I will be buying a larger one soon.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It is my new scent!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...I LOVE the smell and it&#x27;s one of my absolute favorite perfumes but when I purchased it off Amazon I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the size and was very disappointed when I received the teeny tiny little bottle in my mailbox.  Not to mention that it wasn&#x27;t cheap for the size!!!  Next time I&#x27;ll compare the size to a bottle I already have so I don&#x27;t feel like I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> smells awesome , wish it was more, but I knew I was getting a tiny bottle... going to get a big one.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to try before investing in a larger size. Smells clean and not to floral even though the name states flower bomb.</li>
    <li> Writing this review for other people that are thinking about getting this one for their wife or g/f. My wife really loves this perfume. She is European and this perfume seems to be very popular in EU now. 5 stars.</li>
