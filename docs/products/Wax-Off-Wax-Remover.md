      <li>It has a great smell and feel smooth on the skin after use.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome and works really well to remove any wax residue.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>It works as it should but has a very strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>Also smells Amazing, nice clean coconut smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a lotion than a wax residue remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It works well, though you do have to do a bit of massaging to make sure the wax does rub off.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheaper and works better.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>It works much better than this.</li>
      <li>love this stuff after using honee wax by gigi.</li>
      <li>Lovely smell.</li>
      <li>Oil seemed to work better for me.</li>
      <li>Overall, very happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>The place that I used the wax came out really easy...</li>
      <li>Applied after wax and easily removed all remaining residual wax.</li>
      <li>It works fine but the smell is just too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try my wax kit</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I used 1/3 of the bottle that came with my kit the first time I waxed.  </li>
      <li>so I was in a hurry and not taking special care to be neat, so</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than olive or coconut oil, which can be found for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Not bad, just not a miracle wax remover.</li>
      <li>It does remove the wax residue exactly as it claims, but then I have to remove IT, and that is not as easy.</li>
      <li>Any normal body oil helps better than this to remove the wax from the body.</li>
      <li>I broke out in a rash that was pretty bright the next day, and this lotion did nothing to soothe it.</li>
      <li>I am typically always happy with my Gigi products.</li>
      <li>Daughter loves this as it does go with her Gigi wax removing system, I only wish it would take the wax off of the floor of the bathroom floor as easily as she can take it off of her skin!</li>
      <li>This is quite a good addition to any waxing procedure, but if you&#x27;re skilled at what you&#x27;re doing you might not necessarily need this as you won&#x27;t have too much mess afterwards</li>
      <li>You are better off using regular baby oil.</li>
      <li>Received my package on the day expected, and it was nicely packaged in a bubble wrap pouch and the opening was taped on the bottle to prevent leakage.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work!</li>
      <li>The only downside of this is that it doesn&#x27;t wash away easily.</li>
      <li>guess I agree with other reviews that although it smells nice, baby oil works better and is a lot less money.</li>
      <li>I still need to use the cooling gel because this does not sooth very well.</li>
      <li>You really have to work at it to get the wax off</li>
      <li>After using this , i would say that my Neutrogena body oil is much efficient in removing the wax off than this product.</li>
      <li>really helps to remove the wax.</li>
      <li>The Gigi Wax Off was a great help, and will definitely remove small amounts of residual wax.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend adding this to you collection.</li>
      <li>After opening them I discovered that one bottle was a very very light green</li>
      <li>I kind of thought it would actually dissolve the wax, but it just makes it less sticky so you can rub it off easier, like any oil would do.</li>
      <li>I personally like this product and believe the price is very reasonable</li>
      <li>Does not work as well or half as well or even 10% as well as they say, wish I would have paid more for a different brand, ony rated 1 star</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone using soft wax as a removal helper.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get off smaller pieces of wax.</li>
      <li>I am sure next time won&#x27;t be as messy.  </li>
      <li>Once in the middle of a brow (uh-oh) &amp; once right in the middle of the eyelashes.</li>
      <li>(Bigger uh-oh) With this removal, by rubbing it gently between your fingers or against the skin/hair where you don&#x27;t want the wax, it definitely removes it without taking off the hair.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better than any other lotion I have at getting excess wax off fingers, etc.</li>
      <li>Both products smell same, so the difference may simply be a change in formulation by the manufacturer or one could be old.</li>

<li> (so light that it cant really be called green) &amp; the other bottle, which was half empty,  was a darker seafoam green.</li>
<li> This product was a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> I ordered this because I was hoping to use something other than baby oil to remove left over wax.&lt;br</li>
<li> Like that you only need to use a little.</li>
<li> I had purchased this product hoping it would remove the extra wax left on this skin, which is very sticky and impossible to wash off with water.</li>
<li> Received other items in my order from Gigi but not this one.</li>
<li> I also believe that the job of getting rid of oil excess can be done with any other oil-based product.</li>
<li> so I would recommend it to other people.</li>
<li> Either way, there&#x27;s no logical explanation for one bottle being half empty, and I am hesitant to use either bottle as I am unsure if they may have been tampered with, as there weren&#x27;t any safety seals.</li>
<li> This product is not really useful with gigia products as they say</li>
<li> Instead, use baby oil, blot face, then pat baby powder on the area you are going to wax (just a little powder will do the trick).</li>
<li> What a sticky mess, and a waste of money.</li>
<li> It does help to get it off, but I find it still a little hard to use</li>
<li> so I could put a review, don&#x27;t waste money!</li>
<li> Sucks bug time!  </li>
<li> If anything, it makes the leftover wax even worse and messier!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this one...</li>
<li> I am really disappointed</li>
<li> Getting wax off without it is virtually impossible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as described. You definitely need to buy this if you get the GiGi wax kit, as this is not included. The wax leaves a sticky residue and this gets it off.</li>
    <li> really helps to remove the wax.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for getting wax off of skin.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. It does remove the wax, although sometimes I have to use my nail to rub it. I still need to use the cooling gel because this does not sooth very well. I would recommend this product to anyone using soft wax as a removal helper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a mishap - twice. Once in the middle of a brow (uh-oh) &amp; once right in the middle of the eyelashes. (Bigger uh-oh) With this removal, by rubbing it gently between your fingers or against the skin/hair where you don&#x27;t want the wax, it definitely removes it without taking off the hair. Just don&#x27;t apply the removal sheet once you&#x27; see the wax is in a place it shouldn&#x27;t be. Saved me from embarrassing situations!! Lovely smell.</li>
    <li> You really have to work at it to get the wax off but it works after a while.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and works great.  It has a great smell and feel smooth on the skin after use.</li>
    <li> This does not work at all! What a sticky mess, and a waste of money. Oil seemed to work better for me.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great! Very glad I went for it when purchasing my waxing kit.</li>
    <li> love this stuff after using honee wax by gigi. gets the residue off and smells delicious</li>
    <li> Like that you only need to use a little. Removed the wax like it said. Had a pleasant smell. Did not burn or irritate skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It gets the job done with no irritation. However, I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than olive or coconut oil, which can be found for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I am a newbie at self-waxing so I ordered extra of this stuff to &amp;#34;help out&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m glad I did because I used 1/3 of the bottle that came with my kit the first time I waxed.  I was excited to try my wax kit so I was in a hurry and not taking special care to be neat, so I am sure next time won&#x27;t be as messy.

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work! I&#x27;ve use a lot of it to take the wax off my body and still isn&#x27;t enough.. The place that I used the wax came out really easy... Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this one... This product is not really useful with gigia products as they say</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was hoping to use something other than baby oil to remove left over wax.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good, and I like the texture of it. However, it didn&#x27;t remove all the wax. I still had to use&lt;br /&gt;baby oil for some of the leftover wax.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I agree with other reviews that although it smells nice, baby oil works better and is a lot less money.</li>

    <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product hoping it would remove the extra wax left on this skin, which is very sticky and impossible to wash off with water. But  it doesn&#x27;t remove the extra wax. I am really disappointed and I would not recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Removes the wax perfectly. Love!</li>
    <li> It does help to get it off, but I find it still a little hard to use</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, just use baby oil it&#x27;s cheaper and works better. I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular waxer, and this is what I use every time after I&#x27;m finished waxing to get off all the stickiness.  It works well, though you do have to do a bit of massaging to make sure the wax does rub off.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, too.  Overall, very happy with this product.  I am typically always happy with my Gigi products.</li>
    <li> Sucks bug time!  doesn&#x27;t even work !!!!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this as it does go with her Gigi wax removing system, I only wish it would take the wax off of the floor of the bathroom floor as easily as she can take it off of her skin!</li>
    <li> This should be called, &amp;#34;wax off (eventually).&amp;#34; You can get the same results with baby oil or olive oil. I kind of thought it would actually dissolve the wax, but it just makes it less sticky so you can rub it off easier, like any oil would do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with all the extra products like this one. Instead, use baby oil, blot face, then pat baby powder on the area you are going to wax (just a little powder will do the trick). You do not need ANY extra products, so save your money. I broke out in a rash that was pretty bright the next day, and this lotion did nothing to soothe it. However, a touch of hydrocortisone cream applied immediately after waxing resulted in no trace of a rash the second time I used the wax kit.</li>
    <li> Any normal body oil helps better than this to remove the wax from the body. After using this , i would say that my Neutrogena body oil is much efficient in removing the wax off than this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it a zero if that was an opinion.  Because,  it removed 0 excess wax. My suggestion is coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t help removal of wax! I trust Gigi brands and I don&#x27;t understand why they would put this product out that literally doesn&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s a lotion that you rub on that is supposed to soften the wax but it didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and works really well to remove any wax residue. Highly recommend adding this to you collection.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price. Received my package on the day expected, and it was nicely packaged in a bubble wrap pouch and the opening was taped on the bottle to prevent leakage. Also smells Amazing, nice clean coconut smell. Very satisfied, and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This smells good -- like coconuts. But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better than any other lotion I have at getting excess wax off fingers, etc. Not bad, just not a miracle wax remover.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Worked well didn&#x27;t feel sticky after waxing. Applied after wax and easily removed all remaining residual wax. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works as it should but has a very strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> Works and smells really good.  Getting wax off without it is virtually impossible! The added emollients help soothe the skin as well.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete waste of money. It smells nice and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s more of a lotion than a wax residue remover. If anything, it makes the leftover wax even worse and messier! You are better off using regular baby oil. It works much better than this.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well or half as well or even 10% as well as they say, wish I would have paid more for a different brand, ony rated 1 star so I could put a review, don&#x27;t waste money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to do eyebrow waxing for myself at home.  I put the wax off on a cotton ball and rub it over the areas with wax residue.  I also use it to get the residue off of my fingers.  I do, however, recommend washing it off after if you are using it on your face.  It probably contains oils that may clog pores.  It also has a great coconut smell!</li>
    <li> I recieved two bottles of this product today. After opening them I discovered that one bottle was a very very light green (so light that it cant really be called green) &amp; the other bottle, which was half empty,  was a darker seafoam green. Both products smell same, so the difference may simply be a change in formulation by the manufacturer or one could be old. Either way, there&#x27;s no logical explanation for one bottle being half empty, and I am hesitant to use either bottle as I am unsure if they may have been tampered with, as there weren&#x27;t any safety seals.</li>
