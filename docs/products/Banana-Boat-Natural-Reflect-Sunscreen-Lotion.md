      <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>And... I love it.</li>
      <li>Better for kids &#x3D;</li>
      <li>My favorite sunscreen for my kids.</li>
      <li>I am planning on purchasing many more tubes of this stuff.</li>
      <li>It is what was recommended as the best lower priced sunscreen on a site that had reviews of different sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I wish more stores would sell this.  </li>
      <li>it rates pretty good on EWG&#x27;s site and works.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is pretty fair skinned and burns easily.  </li>
      <li>which is what is most important to me.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect and I&#x27;ve studied and it does not cause skin cancer as I have learned other products can.  </li>
      <li>This will still be fine for the rest of my body.</li>
      <li>and I guess it&#x27;s because it is such a great product.  </li>
      <li>But, it actually rubs in very nicely</li>
      <li>It absorbs very nicely and there is no gross sunscreen smell.</li>
      <li>I stock up every year on this and it lasts long and great water proof too.</li>
      <li>Anyway, thanks Banana Boat for a product that blocks the sun without so many toxins and carcinogens.</li>
      <li>Love this item.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda thick when putting on but gives great protection</li>
      <li>And most importantly, it works and does not irritate my daughter&#x27;s or my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I live in Brazil, so sunscreen is very important.</li>
      <li>It also made any flakes on my face very prominent as the white residue stuck to them.</li>
      <li>Did exactly what it is designed to do!</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen for my 2 year old.  </li>
      <li>It still seems to be an effective sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t like the white residue</li>
      <li>My favorite sunscreen for my kids as its the most reasonably priced sunscreen that only uses mineral blockers.  </li>
      <li>(another titanium/zinc-based sunscreen that I have used and that works beautifully) or one of the other sunscreens rated highly by the Environmental Working Group--</li>
      <li>It has the right ingredients so not to harm my baby.</li>
      <li>And all is right in the world.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad the mainstream companies are finally catching on to the fact that consumers need products that aren&#x27;t filled with irritating chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Now I am  very grateful that I found this Banana Boat Natural Reflect for Kids because is safe for my skin and my pocket.</li>
      <li>expensive in store great deal online :)</li>
      <li>I have used this a few times now, while my son was outside for hours, swimming and playing in 90+ degree weather, and it has worked great!  </li>
      <li>And The fact that it lacks all these supposed &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients is cool, too, so I can feel all cool and healthy and natural like a showering hippie while still using a product that ACTUALLY works.</li>
      <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay more for the regular version.</li>
      <li>And my skin doesn&#x27;t blister after being in the hot sun all day.</li>
      <li>One of my daughter&#x27;s has very sensitive skin and many brands (including those labeled for sensitive skin) burn her.  </li>
      <li>This product has a good rating from the Environmental Working Group, and we found it to be much easier to use than other \\&quot;natural products.\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking the white cast problem might be from the fact that the kids version is waterproof, so it&#x27;s a stronger barrier, if that makes sense, and doesn&#x27;t soak in as easily (at all).</li>
      <li>I was really looking for a physical sunblock for my daughter who has eczema and her skin is easily irritated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as sticky as the others we&#x27;ve tried, it isn&#x27;t as white at application, it sinks in better, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it&#x27;s more readily commercially available.  </li>
      <li>My 17 month old son is very fair skinned and loves being outside, so I really needed a good sunscreen without all the nasty ingredients most sunscreens have .  </li>
      <li>It really is tear-free.</li>
      <li>It has worked very well for myself and my 3 children.</li>
      <li>no crying and pain filled eyes,since it is a natural sunscreen you don&#x27;t have to deal with getting cancer when your trying to avoid cancer.</li>
      <li>My daughter has such sensitive skin and burns easy and gets tons of freckles when she does.  </li>
      <li>(They go on so much easier that he doesn&#x27;t even complain when we put the normal sunscreens on.)</li>
      <li>It goes on a lot thicker and leaves much more of a white residue than the regular formula.  </li>
      <li>I have heard that the regular version is better in this regard, so I&#x27;m going to try that one next.</li>
      <li>Bill Nye, the science guy, said that the oxybenzos in most chemical sunscreens wash off in the water and turn male turtles into female turtles...basically have an estrogenizing effect.</li>
      <li>and I have found that it is pretty easy to apply especially compared to other natural sunblocks.  </li>
      <li>I used this because of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; claim on my 4 year old.  </li>
      <li>It was completely ineffective.</li>
      <li>Once on, it provided virtually no sun protection, either in or out of the water, despite frequent re-application.</li>
      <li>Everything else I&#x27;ve tried on my sons sensitive skin has caused a rash.</li>
      <li>My child has excema and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is the kids version, there is an adult version too.</li>
      <li>Finding a natural PABA/paraben free sunblock that&#x27;s also tear free and waterproof was difficult.</li>
      <li>It has no chemicals, all natural.</li>
      <li>have only recently learned about the benefits of using a mineral sunscreen as opposed to a chemical one and this is my first mineral sunscreen for body.</li>
      <li>There are others with higher concentrations but exponentially more expensive</li>
      <li>and then I look more pale than red because it sorta sits on my skin looking as white as it did in the bottle.</li>
      <li>The only natural sunscreen, I have found so far.</li>
      <li>I have a very very sensitive skin and all the sunblock that I have been using before Cause me a severe Allergic reaction , the only thing that I can used was MegaBlock</li>
      <li>this stuff caused a chemical burn on my face as well as caused major itchiness and redness wherever i put it.  </li>
      <li>i wish i knew what was the culprit, because i&#x27;d like to steer clear of it in the future!</li>
      <li>I am sticking to Coppertone and steering clear of this product in the future.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Banana Boat Natural Reflect Sunscreen (I wrote a 5-star review for that product).  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m ok with looking a little pale because I just put this on once</li>
      <li>Instead, I would recommend [[ASIN:B000EY4YLS Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen, Sensitive SPF 30</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super thick--a little goes a long way--</li>
      <li>My only guess is that Banana Boat, not being experienced with natural sunscreens, must have developed a bad formulation--maybe not enough of the active ingredients?</li>
      <li>However, I do have sensitive skin, and this is one of the first sunscreens I&#x27;ve used lately that doesn&#x27;t make my face sting.</li>
      <li>and this is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that has managed to keep my pale skin from getting a tan even in sunny Southern California.</li>

<li> Our family goes to the beach a lot and as long as I reapply if we are there for a long time, we don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
<li> We live in CA and I use sun screen on her everyday and this has never happened with any other brand.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m already a pale person, and this sunscreen left too much of a white cast even for me.</li>
<li> We are outside at little league baseball games all summer long</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything else I&#x27;ve tried on my sons sensitive skin has caused a rash. This was perfect. No smell. No rash. No sunburn! I use it myself now as well. Finding a natural PABA/paraben free sunblock that&#x27;s also tear free and waterproof was difficult. Glad to have found one with all the aspects I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen for my kids. I don&#x27;t know why I ever try anything else. It really is tear-free.</li>
    <li> this stuff caused a chemical burn on my face as well as caused major itchiness and redness wherever i put it.  i wish i knew what was the culprit, because i&#x27;d like to steer clear of it in the future!</li>
    <li> Five stars as product is as described.  This is a great sunscreen for kids/adults that like to spend time in the water.  I like that it rates pretty good on EWG&#x27;s site and works.  My daughter is pretty fair skinned and burns easily.  She had no issues with this product and has spent hours in the pool.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my 2 year old.  We are outside at little league baseball games all summer long and she has never burned while using this product.</li>
    <li> My 17 month old son is very fair skinned and loves being outside, so I really needed a good sunscreen without all the nasty ingredients most sunscreens have .  I have used this a few times now, while my son was outside for hours, swimming and playing in 90+ degree weather, and it has worked great!  He hasn&#x27;t burned at all and it didn&#x27;t irritate his skin or eyes.</li>
    <li> no crying and pain filled eyes,since it is a natural sunscreen you don&#x27;t have to deal with getting cancer when your trying to avoid cancer.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect and I&#x27;ve studied and it does not cause skin cancer as I have learned other products can.  My daughter has such sensitive skin and burns easy and gets tons of freckles when she does.  This has worked great on vacations.  It is impossible to find at stores and I guess it&#x27;s because it is such a great product.  I wish more stores would sell this.  I stock up every year on this and it lasts long and great water proof too.</li>
    <li> Use this for myself as well as my grandkids.  It is perfect.  It is what was recommended as the best lower priced sunscreen on a site that had reviews of different sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I used this because of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; claim on my 4 year old.  He fried after one afternoon and has never had a sunburn before.  I am sticking to Coppertone and steering clear of this product in the future.  I am very upset that he has such a bad burn when I lathered this in :(</li>
    <li> I actually am giving this product a zero star. I bought this product due to its mineral ingredients. My son suffered serious sunburn only after an hour of sun during the first day of application. He never had such bad reaction with other brands, even with the chemical ones. I didn&#x27;t purchase this at Amazon but at Target.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.  Our family goes to the beach a lot and as long as I reapply if we are there for a long time, we don&#x27;t get burned. It&#x27;s a little hard/takes some extra effort to rub in, and is a little sticky but I don&#x27;t mind this since it keeps our skin from getting burned which is what is most important to me.</li>
    <li> I live in Brazil, so sunscreen is very important. I use this one only on the face, because it is a little bit harder to put: It look like a thick  cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best I ever tried.</li>
    <li> The only natural sunscreen, I have found so far. It has no chemicals, all natural. I had watched Dr. Oz &amp; reviewed with WebMd for advice before hand. Its the only brand, I use for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my infant. It has the right ingredients so not to harm my baby. I started using it when she turned six months.</li>
    <li> No, I&#x27;m not a kid. But i use this even though it says &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; on it. And... I love it. This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s not greasy or thin or gross. It&#x27;s super thick--a little goes a long way--and then I look more pale than red because it sorta sits on my skin looking as white as it did in the bottle. but I&#x27;m ok with looking a little pale because I just put this on once and I don&#x27;t burn for the entire day, even though it says 90 minutes or whatever. And The fact that it lacks all these supposed &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients is cool, too, so I can feel all cool and healthy and natural like a showering hippie while still using a product that ACTUALLY works. And I don&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. And my clothes don&#x27;t get disgusting sunscreen stains. And my skin doesn&#x27;t blister after being in the hot sun all day. And all is right in the world. Yay.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy chemical sunscreen for yourself or kids. Bill Nye, the science guy, said that the oxybenzos in most chemical sunscreens wash off in the water and turn male turtles into female turtles...basically have an estrogenizing effect. Look it up, it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS INSTEAD.&lt;br /&gt;This is  a mechanical sunscreen w zinc. Better for kids &#x3D; better for adults and better for the environment. It&#x27;s a little harder to put on, doesn&#x27;t absorb as well but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay. This is the kids version, there is an adult version too.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen worked great! It&#x27;s a little more difficult to rub in than regular sunscreen, but neither my kids nor I have been burned while using it. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Banana Boat Natural Reflect Sunscreen (I wrote a 5-star review for that product).  The price went up a lot so I decided I&#x27;d buy the kids version to save some money.  Unfortunately, the kid version is a very different product.  It goes on a lot thicker and leaves much more of a white residue than the regular formula.  It still seems to be an effective sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t like the white residue so I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay more for the regular version.</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick.  REALLY thick. My toddler hates having it applied to his skin.  After a few days, we gave up and started using it for ourselves, prefering to use Aveda and Nutrogena creams on him.  (They go on so much easier that he doesn&#x27;t even complain when we put the normal sunscreens on.)</li>
    <li> Great product but a bit pricey.  I also wish they would come out with a similar natural one with less SPF.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it is designed to do!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen for my kids as its the most reasonably priced sunscreen that only uses mineral blockers.  There are others with higher concentrations but exponentially more expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that has managed to keep my pale skin from getting a tan even in sunny Southern California. I use it daily and I can honestly say it&#x27;s extremely effective. Like other 100% mineral sunscreens, it&#x27;s a thick formula. But, it actually rubs in very nicely and I don&#x27;t feel sticky afterwards. It absorbs very nicely and there is no gross sunscreen smell. Other sunscreens have caused me to break out on my chest and back, but I&#x27;ve had none of that with this product and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin in the least.&lt;br /&gt;I have only recently learned about the benefits of using a mineral sunscreen as opposed to a chemical one and this is my first mineral sunscreen for body. Not only am I sold on the benefits of mineral vs. chemical, but I am sold on the effectiveness and ease of use of this product. I am planning on purchasing many more tubes of this stuff. And it&#x27;s not just for kids!</li>
    <li> I think this sunscreen is great! It has worked very well for myself and my 3 children. It is thick but does rub in (with a bit of work).</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does what it says. The tube is pretty small for the price, but I think it is comparable to any other sunblock out there. I was really looking for a physical sunblock for my daughter who has eczema and her skin is easily irritated. Like any physical sunblock it does leave a whitish cast, but thats a small price to pay, really, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t care anyway. She wore it out all day and though we did reapply she never burnt.</li>
    <li> Love this item.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda thick when putting on but gives great protection n also doesn&#x27;t burn to put on ur face like some lotions&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive in store great deal online :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this product at a brick-and-mortar store for a beach trip because it was the only non-chemical sunscreen on the shelf. It was completely ineffective. The consistency was thick and sticky, almost like glue, so it was extremely difficult to rub on/in properly. Once on, it provided virtually no sun protection, either in or out of the water, despite frequent re-application. Both my daughter and I burned, two days in a row. My only guess is that Banana Boat, not being experienced with natural sunscreens, must have developed a bad formulation--maybe not enough of the active ingredients? I would give it zero stars if Amazon allowed. Instead, I would recommend [[ASIN:B000EY4YLS Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen, Sensitive SPF 30+, 5-Ounce]] (another titanium/zinc-based sunscreen that I have used and that works beautifully) or one of the other sunscreens rated highly by the Environmental Working Group--I wish that&#x27;s what I had done.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this sunscreen.  I&#x27;m glad the mainstream companies are finally catching on to the fact that consumers need products that aren&#x27;t filled with irritating chemicals.  It works great and I have found that it is pretty easy to apply especially compared to other natural sunblocks.  It does not have quite so bad of that whitening effect.  And most importantly, it works and does not irritate my daughter&#x27;s or my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already a pale person, and this sunscreen left too much of a white cast even for me. Two people at work thought something was wrong with me because my face looked so unnaturally white. It also made any flakes on my face very prominent as the white residue stuck to them. However, I do have sensitive skin, and this is one of the first sunscreens I&#x27;ve used lately that doesn&#x27;t make my face sting. I&#x27;m thinking the white cast problem might be from the fact that the kids version is waterproof, so it&#x27;s a stronger barrier, if that makes sense, and doesn&#x27;t soak in as easily (at all). I have heard that the regular version is better in this regard, so I&#x27;m going to try that one next. This will still be fine for the rest of my body. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other sunscreens, too.</li>
    <li> I have a very very sensitive skin and all the sunblock that I have been using before Cause me a severe Allergic reaction , the only thing that I can used was MegaBlock but they discontinue to produce It, besides  the  cost $ 45 plus the product was great for my skin.  Now I am  very grateful that I found this Banana Boat Natural Reflect for Kids because is safe for my skin and my pocket.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen seems to do its job well. My son complains that his eyes hurt occasionally when showering after using this product, but not as badly as some of the other \\&quot;tear-free\\&quot; sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for the past 2 years. My child has excema and sensitive skin. This is the only one that he doesn&#x27;t react to. I had to order from amazon since its no longer sold in my local stores.</li>
    <li> I bought t his for my daughter and after putting it on and her spending 30 minutes in the sun her face and arms were totally burnt. We live in CA and I use sun screen on her everyday and this has never happened with any other brand. Totally useless and dangerous due to the fact you think you are protected.</li>
    <li> I thought I was helping my kids, but actually did them harm ! Banana Boat  Sport Perfomance spf 100 gave my son a nasty chemical burn on his face. I hope and pray it does not leave a scar. His face looks like leather now after using this product... VERY UNHAPPY... !!!!</li>
    <li> This product has a good rating from the Environmental Working Group, and we found it to be much easier to use than other \\&quot;natural products.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not nearly as sticky as the others we&#x27;ve tried, it isn&#x27;t as white at application, it sinks in better, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it&#x27;s more readily commercially available.  One of my daughter&#x27;s has very sensitive skin and many brands (including those labeled for sensitive skin) burn her.  But she says that this one is no problem.  We were just out from 2:30 to 6:00 pm in the pool with no reapplication and no burn at all.  I&#x27;m wondering if the people who got sunburned didn&#x27;t wait the 15 minutes before going out in the sun like it says on the directions?  Anyway, thanks Banana Boat for a product that blocks the sun without so many toxins and carcinogens.</li>
