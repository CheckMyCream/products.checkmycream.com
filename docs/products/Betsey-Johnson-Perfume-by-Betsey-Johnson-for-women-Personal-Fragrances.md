      <li>I am really glad I went ahead and ordered it, based on the description.</li>

      <li>it just smells cheap, like something you&#x27;d get a dollar store.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know if I get an original</li>
      <li>I have purchased this perfume before and it was much more intense before ..</li>
      <li>I am not a huge floral person, so this is great.</li>
      <li>It is a delicious secnt, just enough sweetness with the fruits and vanilla, but it is more mature than other scents of it</li>
      <li>I will surely get one more when my first bottle is almost empty.</li>
      <li>This is like &#x27;Viva La Juicy&#x27; for real ladies, not little girls :)</li>

      <li>This scent was okay but not quite the same scent that I purchased at a Nordstrom outlet.  </li>
      <li>Sting fragrance, but nice when dies down</li>
      <li>The florals here to me are more of a nice backdrop to the top and base notes.</li>
      <li>It definitely goes in fragrance layers with me, so I get to enjoy all the notes.</li>
      <li>Very girly scent.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a new perfume</li>
      <li>Has such a soft smell yet strong enough to be noticeable but not be overpowering.</li>
      <li>The bottle is just gorgeous and fun as well, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
      <li>When first applied I definitely get the pear along with the berries and a bit of the amber/vanilla.</li>
      <li>I got it near Mothers Day for my mom.</li>
      <li>Please, save your money, plus a little more and do yourself a favor and get something a little more expensive but well worth the price from a proper department store.</li>
      <li>and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for for new smells.</li>

<li> but it has a watered down feel to it</li>
<li> I always get compliments when I spray a little of this perfume.</li>
<li> /&gt;Nauseous, had to throw it away , waste of money</li>
<li> I am just so sad to hear they are no longer making this.</li>
<li> This perfume was so bad that I don&#x27;t even remember buying it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know about those who rated this 5 stars, but no one I know likes this so called perfume. It is way to strong to point of nausea, too sweet and overall it just smells cheap, like something you&#x27;d get a dollar store. Please, save your money, plus a little more and do yourself a favor and get something a little more expensive but well worth the price from a proper department store. If you can&#x27;t, do the world a favor and just bathe properly and don&#x27;t wear any perfume at all.</li>
    <li> Product shipped in a timely manner.  Arrived as described.  Would do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for our daughter, and she loves it! Wears it almost every day</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new perfume and I love Betsey Johnson&#x27;s fashions, so I was reading all the rave reviews of this perfume. I am really glad I went ahead and ordered it, based on the description. It is a delicious secnt, just enough sweetness with the fruits and vanilla, but it is more mature than other scents of it&#x27;s kind. This is like &#x27;Viva La Juicy&#x27; for real ladies, not little girls :) It definitely goes in fragrance layers with me, so I get to enjoy all the notes. When first applied I definitely get the pear along with the berries and a bit of the amber/vanilla. The floral notes are not strong, they are very soft. I am not a huge floral person, so this is great. The florals here to me are more of a nice backdrop to the top and base notes. As it settles in more, the amber/vanilla and musk becomes more obvious and it&#x27;s lovely and sophisticated smelling. This is the perfect scent for a woman who is still young and playful at heart, no matter what her age. The bottle is just gorgeous and fun as well, you can&#x27;t go wrong! I am just so sad to hear they are no longer making this. It does seem alot of online retailers still have it though, so I will hope that Betsey changes her mind and brings it back!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever! Has such a soft smell yet strong enough to be noticeable but not be overpowering. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Sting fragrance, but nice when dies down</li>
    <li> I got it near Mothers Day for my mom. She is happy, but complained that the perfume looks expensive. Wish that it had not been discontinued, but so it goes. Hope they bring it back again. This perfume I do rec.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this perfume as it is a floral and clean smell. This product shipped in a timely manner and was not damaged at all.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I always get compliments when I spray a little of this perfume. Everything was exactly as described. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> First time trying this, it was a blind buy based on reviews and the notes indicated in the scent. I really like it! It&#x27;s fun and flirty, perfect for summer or spring. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This scent was okay but not quite the same scent that I purchased at a Nordstrom outlet.  Perhaps there is another Betsey Johnson perfume.</li>
    <li> My best friend loved it and it was the perfect size, she even got samples for other perfumes and it was a great additinal treat, highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This perfume from store smell definitely and longer !!!!!!😟</li>
    <li> Want something that smells delicious? Well This is it..don’t look any further, I can remember this fragrance back in the day and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for for new smells.</li>
    <li> this perfume is amazing ! it smells wonderful. i would definitely reccommend to any woman that looks perfumes. a patient at my job actually gave it to me as a gift and i decided to buy it myself</li>
    <li> I have purchased this for someone that is a Betsey Johnson FAN.  She says that it is one of the scents that she can wear.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if I get an original but it was&lt;br /&gt;Nauseous, had to throw it away , waste of money</li>
    <li> This was a gift and was what she wanted</li>
    <li> This perfume was so bad that I don&#x27;t even remember buying it. If you want a really incredible perfume, try Flowerbomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this perfume before and it was much more intense before .. I dunno why .. The packaging was correct ..my guess is shelf date but it has a watered down feel to it</li>
    <li> This is one  of the products I have bought on line that I did not regret buying it without trying or testing it. I will surely get one more when my first bottle is almost empty.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very girly scent.</li>
