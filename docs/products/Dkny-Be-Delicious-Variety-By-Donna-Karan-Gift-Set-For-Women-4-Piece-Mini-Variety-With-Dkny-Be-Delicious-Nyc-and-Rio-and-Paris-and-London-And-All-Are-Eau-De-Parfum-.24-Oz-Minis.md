    <li> amazing product. Just in time.</li>
    <li> good size to sample the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, smells GREAT, GOOD price, saved $6.00. These bottles are perfect for in the goers..  just like ME!!!! Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> Nice travel size and variety... Each one is .24 fluid ounce...great combination of fragrance&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;One for whatever your mood...loved them</li>
    <li> I myself have the original DKNY Be Delicious and I love it. I took a chance on this gift set for my daughter in law and she loves it. I haven&#x27;t smelled them all yet, but will be in town to see her next month and am going to enjoy smelling all the different fragrances. I am glad she loved them, she is a great daughter in law, one of a kind.</li>
    <li> Shipment was on time. Good price. Great scents and nice little pouch.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my mom for mothers day. She really loves these I just wish they were a little bigger</li>
    <li> The item came timely and the perfume is easy to carry in my purse or for traveling.  I do not like all the scents but I am overall pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. I knew for sure I liked two of the scents, but didn&#x27;t know about the other two. I only liked the green one and the red one. They&#x27;re very small and you have to twist the cap off (gently) to pour it out. I guess I was hoping for small sprays. They&#x27;re about the size of a walnut. Maybe they&#x27;re okay to travel with or if you want to try out the scents before committing. Other than that, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> 2 of the 4 smell awful. I thought they were sprays, I wish that would have been specified</li>
    <li> Saving for someone special at Christmas</li>
    <li> I couldnt decide which fragrance to buy so for a friend who didnt know what she wanted so I got the variety pack and it was &amp;#34;Problem solved&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I love three of them but I of them is to strong :)</li>
    <li> Not Happy this the scent of these</li>
    <li> Smells great. No sprayerðŸ˜•</li>
    <li> I wish it was a spray make it easy application</li>
