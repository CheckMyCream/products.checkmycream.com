      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and love it, the smell is great, as people have said it goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I tan very easily</li>
      <li>if your looking for a good tanning lotion with a good smell then i recommend this for you if your looking for one to get a good glow go a different route.</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference in color!</li>
      <li>sure did...</li>
      <li>They even gave me a free packet of a triple bronzer!</li>
      <li>this lotion was OK</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Has a nice, light scent.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the tan that it gives but as some bronzers will do this one turned my palms, toes, and in between my fingers orange.  </li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought both as one is a tingle which I LOVE.</li>
      <li>):):)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, and often bronzers and self tanners look unnatural on me, but this gives me a nice natural tan glow.</li>
      <li>and I used it when it first came out, and now I ordered my own bottle</li>
      <li>All in all, very pleased with this product &amp; will definitely be ordering more!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;burnt flesh\\&quot; smell after tanning which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>But overall the JWOWW lotion is a GREAT product</li>
      <li>I received this product bright &amp; early Feb. 27.</li>
      <li>it doesnt make me look fried but gives me the golden tan that people want to acheive!</li>
      <li>and I can tell you it is definitely worth its money!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thick lotion, tan in color &amp; it smells great!  </li>
      <li>and so glad I got it for this price instead of $$$$ high price in salon!</li>
      <li>Thanks for no hastle:)</li>
      <li>While not darker than the best products I&#x27;ve tried, it nearly matches them in quality and costs about a third as much.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product, especially the quality and price.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that isnt great is that the clear top falls off the ACTUAL top...</li>
      <li>Never really got a good glow to me</li>
      <li>This is so far my favorite tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>dance partner, whose skin type generally won&#x27;t bronze, has also found the color to be superior to most other products and she has a great looking tan, if not quite as dark as mine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyways, I highly reccomment this product, I certainly know I will be ordering another bottle ASAP :]</li>
      <li>While others have been either too thick, left a greasy film, or were too runny, this one is perfect, going on easily and absorbed into the skin almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did burn me slightly, but I am more fair skinned &amp; have only been tanning for about a month.  </li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>i was more red</li>
      <li>I tried the JWOW lotion for the first time when I purchased it from amazon.</li>
      <li>I purchased this when it first came on the market and was being sold at tanning salons.</li>
      <li>I would most likely buy this lotion again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty tan</li>
      <li>It produces a beautiful dark bronzing tone in very short time.</li>
      <li>I did try everything in my long life I&#x27;m 46, and this is by far the best tanning lotion , in the market ,at the beginning of my tanning carrier I used swedish beauty , than Australian Gold , and in the last 5/6 yrs always Designer , but when I tried this one it was over for all the rest !!!!</li>
      <li>It also makes a HUGE difference in tanning in my personal opinion.</li>
      <li>And ive seriously spent the money on lotions this takes the cake :):</li>
      <li>my order came SO fast and it was A LOT cheaper than buying this lotion from the tanning salon.</li>
      <li>It was shipped fairly fast.</li>
      <li>Other than that, love the \\&quot;push\\&quot; that it gives my tan.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is just right, and goes away very quickly, pretty much as soon as the tanning session is over, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a lingering smell following you around advertising that you were just at the tanning</li>
      <li>This is hands down one of my favorite tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>i am usually a fair skinned, sometimes pale female.</li>
      <li>cant wait to try the new jjwoww lotion.  </li>
      <li>At the same time, the huge bottle size lasts nearly twice as long as the others I&#x27;ve used, making the real cost about a fifth of what I used to pay.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all to anyone light skinned or dark skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess the clear thing is just decoration.</li>
      <li>so i tan frequently.</li>
      <li>it doesnt feel heavy or sticky on your skin at all, it goes on really smooth.</li>
      <li>The bronzers work well, and are natural looking.</li>
      <li>Keeps smy skin soft.</li>
      <li>and so I have had a very difficult time finding a great bronzer without the unwanted tingle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>must say that Jwoww Black Bronzer has far exceeded my expectations in pretty well every area.</li>
      <li>and it is not empty yet.</li>
      <li>I think this is worth a try - especially if you are trying to work up a nice natural base tan.</li>

<li> I am already dark, and I only go tanning maybe two or three times a week.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell, but the bugs down here in SC</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this when it first came on the market and was being sold at tanning salons. I noticed a huge difference in color! However, after looking at pictures from after using this, I thought I had looked a little orange. But, it was also taken with a cell phone camera and in gym lighting. Looking at myself in the mirror was great, and also got compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Snooki came out though, I would definitely use that instead. This doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell, but the Snooki smells better and I noticed a quicker effect with that than this.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, especially the quality and price.  smells great and goes on smooth.  It is a gradual tan but can definately tell a difference and so glad I got it for this price instead of $$$$ high price in salon!</li>
    <li> Third the price of tanning salon prices - same quality! My kids and I always order our tanning products on line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this off amazon.com because i wanted a nice glow for when i went to Florida, i wanted to get a head start on my tan. It was shipped fairly fast. It was not sealed or nothing after taking it out of the box so i was a little skeptical to use it however a few days later i decided i would give it a whirl and test it out i mean hell with it i bought it and waited a little while for it to come and thought mm what could go wrong really. I used it for 4 days it had an amazing smell while you put it on and lasted for a while. But i never got dark like i was expecting! i was more red then anything for the days i tried it out. Never really got a good glow to me so i just stopped using it. if your looking for a good tanning lotion with a good smell then i recommend this for you if your looking for one to get a good glow go a different route.</li>
    <li> This lotion is SO GREAT. it doesnt feel heavy or sticky on your skin at all, it goes on really smooth. Also the smell is AMAZING and lasts for hours. you dont have ANY of that gross smell you get on your skin from the tanning beds. It also makes a HUGE difference in tanning in my personal opinion. Its the best tanning lotion ive ever used. I have had it for over a year and it is not empty yet.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great worth the price keeps my tan for a long time don&#x27;t need totan as often and you smell good after your done awesome. And ive seriously spent the money on lotions this takes the cake :):):):)</li>
    <li> I ordered this thru amazon because at my salon it costs like $75 and I got it for $24 on here. The tanning tech said the JWOWW would get me a great base color and maybe even get me real dark within a couple weeks. I only tan once maybe twice a week. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and love it, the smell is great, as people have said it goes on smooth. I have noticed now that I&#x27;m darker than a base color that it isn&#x27;t helping me get any darker so I&#x27;ve just ordered INSANELY BLACK and BLACK STORM. As I&#x27;ve read the reviews and again the tanning tech said those ttwo choices, so I&#x27;ve bought both as one is a tingle which I LOVE. So we will see how well they do. But overall the JWOWW lotion is a GREAT product and I loved it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product all year and i love it. i own my own tanning bed so i tan frequently. i am usually a fair skinned, sometimes pale female. This lotion make me look like im naturally dark. it doesnt make me look fried but gives me the golden tan that people want to acheive! love this product!</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this tanning lotion! Has a nice, light scent. The bronzers work well, and are natural looking. I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, and often bronzers and self tanners look unnatural on me, but this gives me a nice natural tan glow. Keeps smy skin soft. Great price too! I think this is worth a try - especially if you are trying to work up a nice natural base tan.</li>
    <li> my order came SO fast and it was A LOT cheaper than buying this lotion from the tanning salon. They even gave me a free packet of a triple bronzer! thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the tan that it gives but as some bronzers will do this one turned my palms, toes, and in between my fingers orange.  I have used other bronzers before without this effect but I now know to thoroughly wipe those areas well after applying before getting in the tanning bed. Other than that, love the \\&quot;push\\&quot; that it gives my tan.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion about two months ago....   Before I was using Sinfully black and dabbled in other lotions.... I stopped tanning for 2 months and then resumed.  I ordered this lotion during my off time and began using it when I started to tan again... I will give it one thing.... It smells good..until you put it on... After you tan you smell like you have worked a hard day in 110+ degree weater... Its awful.... I tan very easily and I have hardly tanned at all with this lotion.  I tan in several different beds and I have yet to go up a shade in makeup...which I should have sinc I went down two shades during my off time.    Don&#x27;t waste your money...  Girls at the tanning salon aid the owner threw what was left of their stock in the trash...They said it didn&#x27;t work and was a waste</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Feb. 23 &amp; it&#x27;s expected arrival date was Mar. 16. I received this product bright &amp; early Feb. 27. Besides it&#x27;s prompt delivery it is just an all around great product! It feels great on my skin &amp; the smell is wonderful. You don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;burnt flesh\\&quot; smell after tanning which is a huge plus. It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;ve applied a perfume. All in all, very pleased with this product &amp; will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best bronzing lotion I have found!! I have used bronzers for years and do not like lotions with tingle factors and so I have had a very difficult time finding a great bronzer without the unwanted tingle.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the best I have found!! Tons of bronzer without streaking, staining, and no tingle!</li>
    <li> This is so far my favorite tanning lotion.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, I DID buy it because of Jersey Shore, but I do find this as a good product.  It&#x27;s a thick lotion, tan in color &amp; it smells great!  It did burn me slightly, but I am more fair skinned &amp; have only been tanning for about a month.  I would most likely buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about three weeks. I am already dark, and I only go tanning maybe two or three times a week. It does smell great. I havent gotten orange or anything from the bronzer. I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> As a competitive ballroom dancer who needs to maintain a decent looking tan year round, I&#x27;ve used a number of products over the years. Even those that gave good bronzing had shortcomings ranging from excessive price to terrible scent to ridiculous package designs that force you to throw them out with a couple of ounces still in the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that Jwoww Black Bronzer has far exceeded my expectations in pretty well every area. It produces a beautiful dark bronzing tone in very short time. While not darker than the best products I&#x27;ve tried, it nearly matches them in quality and costs about a third as much. At the same time, the huge bottle size lasts nearly twice as long as the others I&#x27;ve used, making the real cost about a fifth of what I used to pay. The bottle design lets you get all the product out of the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to throw it away with product still in the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dance partner, whose skin type generally won&#x27;t bronze, has also found the color to be superior to most other products and she has a great looking tan, if not quite as dark as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just right, and goes away very quickly, pretty much as soon as the tanning session is over, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a lingering smell following you around advertising that you were just at the tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the consistency of the product. While others have been either too thick, left a greasy film, or were too runny, this one is perfect, going on easily and absorbed into the skin almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a delightful product and the one I&#x27;ll be using from now on.</li>
    <li> I tried the JWOW lotion for the first time when I purchased it from amazon. The lotion sucks. I get a red tint to me every single time I tan... I&#x27;m pretty tan this lotion just burns me and doesn&#x27;t turn tan. It sucks. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all to anyone light skinned or dark skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and everything went very smooth though! Thanks for no hastle:)</li>
    <li> &lt;3 the glow i get from using this!!  cant wait to try the new jjwoww lotion.  Totally would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! It turned me darkest ever been without any help from the beach. Every time I tanned I got darker and darker and it didn&#x27;t take long at all to see results. I would totally recommend!!</li>
    <li> I did try everything in my long life I&#x27;m 46, and this is by far the best tanning lotion , in the market ,at the beginning of my tanning carrier I used swedish beauty , than Australian Gold , and in the last 5/6 yrs always Designer , but when I tried this one it was over for all the rest !!!!I hope I was helpful ...</li>
    <li> I have have used the entire bottle now and I can tell you it is definitely worth its money! I tan about 2-3 times a week and with this lotion I got some serious color! After you tan you still smell nice too. The only thing that isnt great is that the clear top falls off the ACTUAL top... I guess the clear thing is just decoration. Anyways, I highly reccomment this product, I certainly know I will be ordering another bottle ASAP :]</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of my favorite tanning lotions. The color it gives is a beautiful bronze glow, so don&#x27;t worry about this lotion streaking or turning you orange. The smell is great and not too overpowering. I would recommend this to any tanner.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. A friend of mine had it and I used it when it first came out, and now I ordered my own bottle and I use it faithfully when I am out in the sun. I love it.</li>
    <li> this lotion was OK I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell, but the bugs down here in SC sure did...I got ate up&#x3D;/</li>
    <li> This lotion is good. I used a few bottles before this one and the consistency of this one seemed a little runny. This used to be my go to lotion for a great tan. But I have stopped using this lotion because of personal preference. but this is a good lotion that delivers a good tan. Sometimes it makes you a bit orange but if you cut back on the amount  of lotion you use, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Instant results and doesn&#x27;t smell awful. I was really happy with the results I got from this product and would buy it again and reccomend it to friends</li>
