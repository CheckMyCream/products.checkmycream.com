      <li>:]</li>
      <li>It worked for the most part</li>
      <li>Fabulous and so affordable!</li>

      <li>but I get a feeling that my face has become more greasier than ever.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best facial cleaner out there!!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nothing more then cream soap</li>
      <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
      <li>Cons: Scent - not too strong, but</li>
      <li>nice face wash, gives your face clean and fresh</li>
      <li>I slathered it with moisturizer and it was fine.</li>
      <li>This did not overdry my face, yet is still oil free.  </li>
      <li>Works great as a regular cleaner...on people who don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
      <li>not like other cleanser, this project is very good for oily skin.</li>
      <li>I love to use it at night to remove all my make up, I leaves my face clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>feel clean and smooth after wash.</li>
      <li>I just used hand soap at first until a friend clued me in on this magic oil-busting cleanser.</li>
      <li>I use a makeup wipe first, and then use face wash to make sure I clean my face well.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, this creamy cleanser seems far more suited for my normal/dry skin than the senitive liquid formula.</li>
      <li>I prefer no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I hoped    </li>
      <li>After I use this, it just feels fresh, clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Does not exactly leave a matte finish on the skin, but is great at removing oil.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean and fresh scent, creamy consistency and the way my face fills and looks...</li>
      <li>Clean my face well at first</li>
      <li>its soft and my skin feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I am willing to take a chance and keep on using the cleanser.</li>
      <li>it leaves your face feeling clean, soft and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>As I dry and touch my face, it feels very clean.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>After years of trying different face soaps and washes, this by far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>What can you say about it, does what its supposed to do, great the bad stuff of you face and leaves it fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It felt more heavy/oily going on and left a film on my skin and seemed to be causing my breakouts to flare up more than usual.</li>
      <li>My skin felt extra clean after (I used it with my silicone exfoliating face scrubber)</li>
      <li>my moderate acne went away almost completely, but once I started pairing it with moisturizer (after getting some sound advice regarding using moisturizer despite having oily skin...</li>
      <li>Feels strange when lathering up, but leaves you feeling clean afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I would have to scrub and rinse my face 4 times with Ivory soap in order to get it as clean as a single application of this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I always have a hard time finding a good face cleanser that will remove makeup but not dry out my skin...</li>
      <li>Generally, my makeup is pretty light (BB cream, eyeliner, little bit of eyeshadow).</li>
      <li>So maybe it works to well at first, but later on it does produce some oil.</li>
      <li>However, I find my regular Dove sensitive soap does a better job and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with that tight feeling.</li>
      <li>but I was looking for something that removed makeup completely</li>
      <li>I am WAY to old to have the gnarly complexion of a twelve year old, so this stuff has been a rocking product.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is creamy and lathers well, removes dirt and oil and leaves your skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this face wash did not work for me.  </li>
      <li>I began using this product in my early to mid-twenties.  </li>
      <li>My 28 year old daughter loves it too.  </li>
      <li>my acne went away completely.  </li>
      <li>But that would leave my face raw and dry, so this way is far better.</li>
      <li>I have VERY oily skin in the t-zone and moderately dry skin everywhere else.</li>
      <li>Very oily by my nose and forehead, but so dry (to the point of excema) on my cheeks, and then acne on my chin and neck.</li>
      <li>I generally get some product and work it into foam before washing my face.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will remove makeup as well as it does with your natural oils and random schmutz from the day, though I have no direct experience with the makeup.</li>

<li> Both me and my wife like it and use it everyday for the past two years</li>
<li> In the past, I have used Olay products (usually creams) with no issue.</li>
<li> I am not sure which ingredient my skin reacted to, but the only other product that has caused a bad reaction for me was Aveeno.</li>

<li> I have really weird skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> nice face wash, gives your face clean and fresh</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for a great price.  This cleanser is creamy and lathers well, removes dirt and oil and leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> Product as described - Fast Shipping - Very Satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> There is something in this product that my skin just doesn&#x27;t like. I used it in the shower for about a week and my neck and chest both started to become red and itchy (I only used it to wash my face, but of course the product travels with the water). I stopped use and the effects went away. Not worth returning due to cost, but definitely won&#x27;t order again. I am not sure which ingredient my skin reacted to, but the only other product that has caused a bad reaction for me was Aveeno. In the past, I have used Olay products (usually creams) with no issue.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it&#x27;s nothing more then cream soap and it dries the skin. I use it up but I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> I have a complexion that likens our moon (not that I have had the joy of walking it). Craters? Yes, why thank you. Grease? Indeed. I am WAY to old to have the gnarly complexion of a twelve year old, so this stuff has been a rocking product. Zits reduced. My agony of memories of life that is only saved my no headgear, will always remain.</li>
    <li> very great face cleanser. Both me and my wife like it and use it everyday for the past two years</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for oily skin. It&#x27;s healing my face up genteelly. I hope &#x27;em keep provide this product forever.</li>
    <li> I love to use it at night to remove all my make up, I leaves my face clean and fresh. Just need to use a little bit, the bottle lasts up to 6 months using it every night.</li>
    <li> Feels strange when lathering up, but leaves you feeling clean afterwards.  Does not exactly leave a matte finish on the skin, but is great at removing oil.</li>
    <li> What can you say about it, does what its supposed to do, great the bad stuff of you face and leaves it fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleaner out there!!</li>
    <li> I have really weird skin. Very oily by my nose and forehead, but so dry (to the point of excema) on my cheeks, and then acne on my chin and neck. What the heck do I buy for that? I figured this combination wash would be okay. I do like how it foams and lathers nicely. My skin felt extra clean after (I used it with my silicone exfoliating face scrubber) but after I got out of the shower, my face soon had that tight dry feeling. I slathered it with moisturizer and it was fine. However, I find my regular Dove sensitive soap does a better job and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with that tight feeling. I like this, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I began using this product in my early to mid-twenties.  I will be 33 in March...so I&#x27;ve used it for about 9 years.  This product is THE ONLY product that cleared my skin up.  I had moderate acne in which my skin was almost never without a few blemishes here and there.  I have VERY oily skin in the t-zone and moderately dry skin everywhere else. I cannot and will not use typical acne washes because the salicylic acid and/or benzyl peroxide actually irritates my skin and makes me break out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I began using this product my moderate acne went away almost completely, but once I started pairing it with moisturizer (after getting some sound advice regarding using moisturizer despite having oily skin...something I always thought was counterproductive) my acne went away completely.  This is one of those products that makes me wonder what the heck I am going to do if Olay ever stops making this product!  I will be lost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when my now-fiancee moved in with me he used this product once the stuff he had ran out.  He has similar skin to mine and would always have a blemish.  I told him to try it out and he also fell in love with this product.  It is a staple in our bathroom.  I use it in the shower every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have known about it when I was a teenager, I wouldn&#x27;t have obsessed about my skin as much as I did, though I am thankful that I never had full-blown acne.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this face wash did not work for me.  It felt more heavy/oily going on and left a film on my skin and seemed to be causing my breakouts to flare up more than usual.</li>
    <li> I tried so many cleansers,and found that this one is great and is not expensive. I like it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  I am 30 and still battle some acne.  This did not overdry my face, yet is still oil free.  This is the clearest my skin has been in a while, even though it is not medicated.</li>
    <li> It worked for the most part but I was looking for something that removed makeup completely and this doesn&#x27;t do so great of a job. It didn&#x27;t dry my face out but it didn&#x27;t remove all it said it would. Works great as a regular cleaner...on people who don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Clean my face well at first but I get a feeling that my face has become more greasier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a face wash product that will irritates my skin and this is it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great service. Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser! And, for whatever reason, can no longer get the Combo/oily version in stores. Fabulous and so affordable! Bought several...can keep one in travel kit, one in workout bag and several in reserve. Interestingly, this creamy cleanser seems far more suited for my normal/dry skin than the senitive liquid formula.</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time finding a good face cleanser that will remove makeup but not dry out my skin... This face wash is amazing! You only need a little bit and it goes a long way. Previously i would have to wash my face and still need makeup remover to remove whatever got left behind. IThi sone is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is a good face wash. The price is no different than you&#x27;d pay in store though so not a bargain.</li>
    <li> love this, works great without drying out my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months nightly to remove makeup. You only need to use a pea size drop to wash your entire face. I generally get some product and work it into foam before washing my face.    Pros: Foaming, smooth, lots of product, not drying, good packaging  Cons: Scent - not too strong, but I prefer no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I hoped    The biggest problem I have with this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my makeup. I use a makeup wipe first, and then use face wash to make sure I clean my face well. Generally, my makeup is pretty light (BB cream, eyeliner, little bit of eyeshadow). However, when I use my toner after the facewash, I still see remnants of makeup on my face. Recently, I&#x27;ve been washing my face with a different product at night and have changed this for morning use.</li>
    <li> I used this with my Clarisonic.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a gentle face wash and the things I tried were either too harsh, or oily.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I didn&#x27;t need a hard core cleanser.  This is perfect.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Olay name.  It&#x27;s gently and it foams up beautifully.  I used it without Clarisonic just to see if it worked just as well and it did.  it leaves your face feeling clean, soft and refreshed.  I&#x27;m the big 5-0 so I&#x27;m trying to take care of my skin any way I can.  I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on products that don&#x27;t work. I workout every day and by the end of the day, my skin is oily from sweating and it just feels yucky.  After I use this, it just feels fresh, clean and smooth.  Give it a try.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed in this.  I let me mom try it and she&#x27;s in her 80&#x27;s and loves it.  My 28 year old daughter loves it too.  She wears tons of makeup and she said it does a great job of taking it off.</li>
    <li> I use this every night to wash the makeup and oil off my face. A lot of face washes dont wash off makeup well, but this one does. Doesnt leave my face too dry after either</li>
    <li> I have combination skin type, so usually all products are to strong for me... making my face tight and dry or are not strong enough... causing blackheads... This product is perfect! :] I love it&#x27;s clean and fresh scent, creamy consistency and the way my face fills and looks... clean and fresh :D</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin.  After years of trying different face soaps and washes, this by far is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This cleanser definitely takes care of the oily skin I have on my face. However I have noticed that after awhile, there is a heavy feeling on my face. I wash then add my foundation, which is meant for oily skin, and after some time, my skin feels heavy. So maybe it works to well at first, but later on it does produce some oil. Overall, I still like the product! It could just be my foundation. I am willing to take a chance and keep on using the cleanser.</li>
    <li> not like other cleanser, this project is very good for oily skin. feel clean and smooth after wash. very good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it simply disintegrates the oil on your face. I would have to scrub and rinse my face 4 times with Ivory soap in order to get it as clean as a single application of this cleanser. But that would leave my face raw and dry, so this way is far better. You only need a bit, too. This container lasts a looong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this when I had to use nose strips to sleep at night. Before you can attach the strips your nose must be thoroughly cleaned of any oils. I just used hand soap at first until a friend clued me in on this magic oil-busting cleanser. I thought it would be a lot more expensive, too, as it is marketed as a &amp;#34;beauty product&amp;#34; and makeup remover. I&#x27;m sure it will remove makeup as well as it does with your natural oils and random schmutz from the day, though I have no direct experience with the makeup.</li>
    <li> This cleanser foams a bit and cleans my face well. As I dry and touch my face, it feels very clean. It almost feels like my face was stripped of everything but yet doesn&#x27;t feel dry. I do have combination skin, so maybe that helps leave some hydration on my face after using this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love it! its soft and my skin feels clean and fresh after using it. Have not tryed it yet on makeup but hope it removes it completly!</li>
</ol>
