      <li>If you want a great shaver, this is one to consider.</li>
      <li>I like the shaver and use it for my beard and my bald head and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Trimmer works great for maintaining sideburns, goatees, etc.  </li>

      <li>The quality of the construction &amp; materials is very good, I find no faults here, however, I feel like the indicator lighting scheme could have been better designed.</li>
      <li>I havn&#x27;t used the cleaning system yet as rinsing the soap out of it after each use works just as good.</li>
      <li>and it did not shave nearly as good as this one.</li>
      <li>the feeling of shaving with foam is just really good.     </li>
      <li>Cuts fairly well.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s about all I can say that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s almost as good as a Mach 3 blade and gel.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Panasonic ES8078 and it was received in good condition.</li>
      <li>I am impressed with its features, the price and the speed with which the order was filled.</li>
      <li>Good luck in your search.</li>
      <li>he had a self-cleaning braun razor that seemed good at the time, but does not hold a candle to this guy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shaver every day for close to a year, and I still haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to get all of my neck.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
      <li>The good</li>
      <li>Even a good friend who is using a Braun electric shaver told me that he has to use a hand shaver on some spots.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades)</li>
      <li>GOOD SHAVER</li>
      <li>Purchased from Amazon at a good price and used for 4 months now.</li>
      <li>The not so good</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very nice shaver and a very nice cleaner.</li>
      <li>This is my first electric shaver and I am happy to say that it has been one of the greatest investments Ive ever made.</li>
      <li>but they both appear to be exceptional razors.  </li>
      <li>If any, the up-and-down swivel motion would be more helpful to have the shaver more perfectly aligned with the skin surface.  </li>
      <li>If you follow these steps, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be as happy with this shaver as I am.</li>
      <li>This shaver works great if you know how to get the most out of it.</li>
      <li>Being able to shave in my room and just as quickly is great.</li>
      <li>The closeness of the shave on the cheek and sideburns area is great - better than the norelco.  </li>
      <li>I am VERY glad I did!&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all, very pleased, would recommend to anyone thinking of converting from blade to electric.</li>
      <li>The product itself is great and love the self-clean feature.  </li>
      <li>But to get right to the point, it is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in 20 years of shaving.</li>
      <li>This electric razor pretty much is a wonderful product that gets the job done and does not break the bank.</li>
      <li>But please Panasonic, put filters in more mainstream stores!</li>
      <li>My first electric shaver, and I&#x27;m very impressed!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t much use the Wet function of this shaver but I can tell you it outperforms any shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried. It shaves as close as a razor and goes the same place, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life? You mean, it&#x27;s powered by a battery, not some kind of neverending fuel-cell technology? The battery never dies in this thing. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve tried to kill it, I&#x27;ve tried to get it below 3 bars (max), but it never did. I&#x27;ll bet you could go a month without charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning function is pretty cool. It uses cleaning cartridges and regular water to make a neat detergent combination that makes the shaver sparkling clean no matter how clogged you put the shaver in to begin with. I don&#x27;t like how often you need to scour the internet to buy new cartridges, though, but at least it&#x27;s tolerant of reusing old filters, if you don&#x27;t mind using regular water to clean with. Just do NOT reuse a filter more than once (two uses total). You&#x27;ll find a clogged cleaner and a wet shaver waiting for you when you go to shave the next time. Quite disgusting pulling that mess out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice shaver and a very nice cleaner. But please Panasonic, put filters in more mainstream stores!</li>
    <li> Cuts fairly well. Not worth the price. Look elseware for a better deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved my head on a daily basis since the ripe old age of 23 (14 years now) with shaving cream and a razor. Over the last few years I noticed my skin becoming more sensitive to the constant assault of the razor and harsh shaving creams so I decided to give electric razors a shot. I didn&#x27;t really expect much because Im pretty picky about having a very smooth head. After reading many online reviews, I decided to purchase this unit. I figured any of the cheaper models would just be a waste of money. I am extremely pleased with this shaver! Upon the first use I was totally amazed at the razors ability to shave as close as a blade. It really does! That combined with not having to deal with daily razor burn, redness and irritation from the blade makes this a hands down winner. I&#x27;ll never use a blade again. With that being said, don&#x27;t expect any electric razor to give you a prefect shave with a single pass; it takes a few swipes going against the nap of my hair to get razor close. It also take me longer to shave with the electric razor (about three mins), but the benefits outweigh the extra shaving time by far.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an earlier model -- I think the ES8067 -- whose battery was failing after 6 years of faithful (and sometimes rough condition) service. My primary criteria was that the shaver had to be wet/dry and work safely in the shower, besides shaving well. I very much liked the constant speed feature of the earlier Panasonic which translated into effective cutting and thus smoother shaving even as the battery discharged.    In short, this version is a dramatic improvement over the prior model, shaving even closer with noticeably less skin irritation. I think this is due to a combination of the floating heads, the pivoting head assembly which work together to effect more constant contact with my face and beard and to the greater speed of ES8078S model. It is far more comfortable to grip and the grip in the shower is definitely more sure. The shaver is slightly lighter but feels much lighter due to its contoured shape. I quickly discovered that this shaver shaves very close without much pressure. It shaves as close as a blade with much less irritation. As a point of information, I have a pretty tough beard coupled with moderately sensitive skin.    As to a lubricant for wet shaving: after trying several, I discovered that using \\&quot;Olay Body Wash, Ultra Moisture with Shea Butter\\&quot; works extremely well. It provides a light but well lubricated media -- no blade clogging but very slippery and then it cleans readily. Make sure that you use the \\&quot;Ultra Moisture with the Shea Butter\\&quot; (Olay makes several mixes of the Body Wash product) because the shea butter provides the real lubrication.    I have not had it long enough to comment on the cleaning system, which has drawn some disparaging remarks elsewhere but then I anticipate cleaning it immediately after shaving while still in the shower.    Overall, I recommend this to anyone considering electric shaving. A very close shave with little to no skin irritation. What more could one ask?</li>
    <li> I got this at an excellent discount from Amazon for my boyfriend for Father&#x27;s Day. His old Remington razor couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and the blades were no longer spinning correctly causing him to nick his face often. He was so happy to get the Panazonic ES8078S! He loves it. Says its the best razor he&#x27;s ever had! He said it&#x27;s the easiest to handle, gives the closest shave, is too easy to clean, and looks cool and modern siting in its charging/cleaning station on the sink. This was definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This shaver system is all that it is purported to be!  I have found it works the best for me when using with shaving cream or lotion.  It also works great in the shower but I usually miss some places there due to the lack of a mirror.  It is also inconvenient to find a place to set it down in the shower without the fear of knocking off onto the floor.  I have also used it with shaving powder but find that using it wet with shaving cream gives a better and closer shave.  Have not used the self-cleaning feature yet due to the fact that I use it wet and rinse off the unit after each shave.  Only drawback is that the re-charging base stand is fairly large and gobbles up a lot or room on the bathroom vanity surface.</li>
    <li> My last 2 Brauns died prematurely because of poor plastic materials used in the knive&#x27;s motion transmission. Decided to leave the brand after more than 40 years of loyalty.    This Panasonic is doing a wonderful job of shaving. Purchased it from Amazon about a month ago.    Pros: shaves well, quiet, fast, battery recharges quickly, easy to clean with soap under water.    Room for improvement:   1. Too bad it is not offered without the bulky cleaning station. Why pay for it if is not necessary.   2. The head swivels only side-to-side but not up-and-down. My last Braun did both and that was very convenient. If any, the up-and-down swivel motion would be more helpful to have the shaver more perfectly aligned with the skin surface.  3. The carved shape of the handle does not give me the leveraged grip as the straight one did.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is a good deal, but I am sure the product is a good gift for my father.</li>
    <li> I had been a satisfied Braun shaver user for several decades, preferring them to a prior Norelco/Phillips. In looking for a replacement for a worn out Braun, I read reviews stating that various brands (including Braun) presented problems for many users and the recent family of Panasonic shavers appeared to have the fewest reported problems. The purchased Panasonic ES8078S shaver itself is bulkier, but battery life is much better than my previous Brauns. I purchased it believing that I would use it as a dry shaver (as were my previous Brauns), but trying it as a wet shaver with shaving cream convinced me this was a much better way -- much less drag and irritation. So far I have not used the auto-clean system to clean it, but rather rinsed it under the faucet daily. I get over 3 week&#x27;s once-a-day use out a full charge, which takes little time. A small word of caution on battery life: number of shaves with indicated battery condition is not linear -- I get many more shaves when the battery indicator is showing \\&quot;High\\&quot; than when it shows \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; and many fewer  when it shows \\&quot;Low\\&quot;. After a few month&#x27;s use, I am completely satisfied with this shaver, feeling that it is better than any previous shaver, although I admit I would prefer that the shaver itself (without HydraClean and charger) be smaller for travelling.</li>
    <li> I ordered this new shaver for my husband based on other reviews and I needed a multi-surface shaver.  My husband has course whiskers and a mostly bald/shaved head.  He had used a Braun for about 10 years.  He was really pleased with the performance over his face but wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference on his head.  He was wrong.  This shaver performed great on his face and smoothed his tender head like a champ!  What do I as his wife, appreciate the most?  QUIET!!!  This shaver is very quiet compared to his Braun shaver.  It&#x27;s really just a hummmmmm.  Would I recommend it?  ABSOLUTELY!</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors before, the $35-$50 variety, they live a short life &amp; dullen very quickly.  I have had Very good results with razor, stays sharp &amp; retains a charge.  Very nice for when I&#x27;m late for work, just grab &amp; shave 0n the Go.  Not irritating &amp; after running awhile the head warms up and gives a close shave.  Just have to run along neck sideways for a few minutes to get all those long stiffer bristles.  Always brush clean before next use and good shave will result. I Highly recommend this razor!!!  I purchased for about $60.00, No Tax, No shipping.  A value at that price!</li>
    <li> I have replaced an older Panasonic razor and can&#x27;t believe the difference. This razor shaves faster and smoother than I had even expected.   I had trouble comparing the ES8078S and the ES8077S, I emailed and asked Amazon what the difference was due to the ES8077S being $10 higher in price, No response, I called Panasonic and the tech told me that the ES8078S was a new model and the ES8077S was going out, but then reading reviews I found that the ES8078S has been out for quite a while, so the tech didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about and fibbed to me? I then wrote an email to Panasonic customer support and their reply was that these two razors are identical and that Panasonic basically used the ES8077S and their specialty store line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in August, 2006 to shave my beard.  I selected the Panasonic because I had used dry electric shavers before with no success, and from day one this puppy gave me a close shave with Gillette Edge.  I sported a mustache and sideburns back then, and found that the trimmer wasn&#x27;t ideal for the mustache but did fine with the sideburns.    I was nervous a year later when I got rid of the &#x27;stache for the final time--worrying that the razor wouldn&#x27;t do under the nose very well.  I was wrong--it has no problems with the upper lip--even those pesky hairs that aren&#x27;t sure whether they&#x27;re nose hairs or mustache.    In 2009 I decided that I was not going to win the male-pattern-baldness battle and I shaved my head with a Mach 3.  After a couple of weeks, I wondered whether the Panasonic could handle shaving my head.  I have only used a blade one time since then--a disastrous endeavor that left the back of my scalp a bloody mess.  The Panasonic needs several passes now to get everything smooth, but once it&#x27;s done it is as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s backside.    In four+ years, I have replaced the blades/screen once (late 2008).  The batteries still work for three or four days of face/head shaving, but I think they&#x27;re starting to go.  It&#x27;s also taking more passes for a smooth shave.  I&#x27;m writing the review now because I decided I would shop for a new shaver instead of replacing the consumables again, but I think I&#x27;m going to get the $35 kit one more time and see if it lasts the year.    The downsides--the cleaner/charger noise drives my wife nuts.  I have to try to remember to start the cycle after she has finished in the bathroom or else the vibration resonates for the rest of the day.  When I pointed out that $35 to refresh it is substantially less than $200+ for the Braun series 7 or the new LA93, I could see the gears whirring to justify the disparity.    Other downside:  The contacts on this model are in little wells on the base of the unit--which sit straight up when in the charger.  I had some trouble with the contacts after six months or so, but after cleaning the contacts I began drying them with the corner of a towel every day and I haven&#x27;t had any more problems.  I think the newer models have surface contacts so I doubt this is a problem.    About Me:  I received radiation treatment in the &#x27;80s over some of my face, so I have both light and heavy beard along with both sensitive and normal skin.  The only times I have felt irritation were after going for a week without shaving.  I shave in the shower daily.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for 3-4 years finally changed the foil and cutting head.this shaver has worked perfectly, recently I started spending more time shaving thats when I decided to change the Foil and Cutting heads ($40.00 and took about 15 seconds to change out) This is the best shaver I have ever owned, however I am upgrading to the panasonic ES LA93 K, cause I have read reviews that say it is the beast! and my face deserves the best always!!! and Panasonic is the best hands down</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Mach 3 user for years, but finally switched back to electric after discovering Panasonic&#x27;s line of shavers. This product shaves as well as manual razors in half the time without the mess. Although it&#x27;s powerful as advertised, the 13k rpm motor is really loud. If you don&#x27;t have a thick beard, the new 10k rpm triple head may be the better option. Another minor issue I don&#x27;t particularly care about (but I&#x27;m sure some people do), is that the plastic body looks and feels a bit cheap. Overall, a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about a year ago to replace a three year old Norelco rotary shaver...one of their less expensive models.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way the Norelco was making my face red after shaves, so I decided to try this Panasonic foil wet/dry shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic&#x27;s shave quality was OK, but it turns out it isn&#x27;t much better than the much less expensive Norelco I replaced it with.  It does a good job on the face, but neck coverage is pretty bad.  I&#x27;ve been using the shaver every day for close to a year, and I still haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to get all of my neck.  It misses a bunch of spots if I try to shave with gentle/normal pressure.  But if I try going over those spots again or add additional pressure, I get a lot of redness, especially around my adam&#x27;s apple. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried both wet and dry.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving in the shower versus wetting down my face in a sink.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving gels and/or soap.  There&#x27;s no major improvement with any of those changes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah...and this shaver is loud...REALLY loud.  When I&#x27;m holding it close to my ears, I&#x27;m almost wondering if I should be wearing hearing protection. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THEN...last week it broke.  During a shave, all of a sudden the Panasonic went into self-clean mode (a high-pitched vibration).  5 seconds later, it turned itself off.  5 seconds later, it went back into normal shave mode.  Self-clean, off, shave mode...over and over again in 5 second intervals.  It wouldn&#x27;t stop.  I had to let the battery run out before it&#x27;d stop this annoying cycle, which took the better part of the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I spent at least an hour on the phone with Panasonic shaver support yesterday.  I talked to three or four people, each going up the chain in command.  The problem?  Even though the shaver is under warranty, they asked me to mail it to their service center in Kent, Washington...then wait 30 days for a letter.  Once I got that letter, they&#x27;d advise me whether they&#x27;d berepairing my shaver or sending me a refurbished one.  Then they&#x27;d presumably fix it...but I&#x27;d probably be without a shaver for 45-60 days.  When I questioned the support tech, then her boss, then his boss about this policy, they said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, that&#x27;s just the way it works.  We get a lot of returns, so we can&#x27;t do it any faster.\\&quot;  I asked them how I was supposed to shave if my shaver was gone for 45-60 days, and they recommended I go out and buy a new shaver!  What a pointless warranty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I finally pressed harder and harder as I got higher up the ladder within Panasonic.  The final guy said to me, \\&quot;Just like you, we have a lot of other customers who ask for a quick-exchange policy while their shavers are broken.  But unfortunately we can&#x27;t do that.\\&quot;  I asked him if he saw the stupidity in that policy...and he acknowledged my complaint, but said his hands were tied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m back to my old Norelco rotary shaver for the next couple of months.  The funny thing?  It&#x27;s actually giving me a better shave than the Panasonic has been for the past year.  I&#x27;m wondering if I should even bother sending in the Panasonic for service.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver does have a few positives though.  The Panasonic is nice and light, and the battery lasts forever between charges.  You could easily go for several weeks without recharging this thing.  The long hair trimmer is also the best I&#x27;ve ever used, better than the Norelco I owned previously, as well as better than both of the Remingtons I owned before that.  But that&#x27;s about all I can say that&#x27;s good.  Oh, it&#x27;s nice looking too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was really hopeful with this product, especially because I&#x27;ve never had a bad Panasonic product.  Until now.  Panasonic, you&#x27;ve let me down. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I started using an electric shaver about 7 years ago, I&#x27;ve had this one for 1 month. This is the 3rd one that I have owned and it is the best. The shave is close, it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I have not even used the cleaning station yet. Why bother? All I have to do is a quick clean with some liquid soap. There is a paper that came with the shaver that even says that. I have done that for years anyway because it is so easy. This shaver had great reviews and does just what it is supposed to, it gives a great close shave. I would suggest this shaver. Get the bang for your buck, this is a great deal!!</li>
    <li> This little beauty from Panasonic really delivers.  I get a close shave without any nicks or irritation and have been especially impressed the way the shaver cuts my neck hairs without any problems. The Remington foil and Norelco rotary shavers that I&#x27;ve owned in the past pale in comparison to this Panasonic.  The flexibility of being able to use it in or out of the shower and with or without shaving cream are big bonuses as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks that I have encounted with the shaver is the noise it puts out while using and during the self-cleaning phrase that one can use if he wishes. (Both of these are minor issues.)  I have found, however,  that it&#x27;s just as easy to clean the shaver with a little hand soap and water as it is to use the included cleaning system.  The buyer will also find that the replacement cleaning cartridges are a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll pay a little extra for this shaver, but when you consider how often you use it and how effectively it works---it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaving system. They told me to wait for 30 days so that it will set to my face for nice clean shave. till now after using this i had to use my ordinary razor to finish my shaving. not worth at all. i am going to return this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8078 and it was received in good condition. I used the shaver four times and thought it was great. Then I tried cleaning it in what they call Turbo Mode and that was the end of a servicable unit. The shaver would not return to shave mode.You can not shave in turbo mode as it will cut your face as it vibrates in this mode. I have tried to get Panasonic to replace the unit but with no luck.The only service center Panasonic has is in Mcallen TX and they only have reconditioned units. I wanted a new exchange but I received a used unit. They said if I returned the used unit I would get a new one,but what did I get another used shaver. Panasonic assured me it was like new.I agreed to try it and this shaver will only run in Turbo Mode.So this too is a useless shaver.</li>
    <li> Being a former Norelco user, it does take getting used to the non round blades.  My skin didn&#x27;t need any time to adapt to the new shaver.  I really think the Panasonic has given me the closest shave I have ever had.  After using it for a few months now, I am even more convinced.  I use it dry (I always have) and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the Panasonic.  The cleaning system works well and is a little loud, but I wait until a saturday to clean it as to not wake my wife as I leave early for work.</li>
    <li> Pros:  - Wet/Dry capabilities   - Cordless  - Cleaning unit works well    Cons:  - Not for coarse hair   - The flip-out beard outliner must first be used, then the actual shaver must be passed over face repeatedly for less than desired result  - Does not seem to be powerful enough</li>
    <li> Smooth Shave. Doesnt work AS good as a regular razor as some people state. Does work good for lazy days though.</li>
    <li> This is my second Vortex shaver.  My last one lasted only about one and a half years before giving problems, poor shave very noisy and erratic motor speed.  At first they give a great shave which is why I have bought the same shaver again, probably the best shave I have ever had and I have tried Remington and Braun before.  I had always used the cleaning system but still ran into problems with performance.  Even with this new shaver I feel that I get better performance if I do not use the cleaning system but follow their advice for the alternative cleaning method. In short, great shave don&#x27;t expect it to last though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He has really sensitive skin and had never been able to use an electric shaver because they irritated his skin.  He absolutely loves and reccomends this razor!  It charges and cleans pretty quickly and shaves close to the skin without \\&quot;tugging on the hair\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought the Vortex about a half year ago and have been very pleased with its&#x27; performance.  I had a Braun 8595 shaver before, that is the first and last Braun shaver that I will ever buy.  I have always had luck with Panasonic shavers, the Vortex gives me a much smoother shave than the Braun.  Even after replacing the blades &amp; cover on the Braun, it still tore my face up.  I have no such problems with the Panasonic Vortex.  The one advantage that the Braun had over the Vortex is the cleaning system.  The Vortex takes forever to run a clean cycle and does not seem to clean the shaver as well as the Braun did.  Regardless, I am glad that I switched to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> It takes a couple of weeks to get used to. After that,  forget about razers. Now I shave while I watch TV. When I am done, It cleans itself while charging. Havn&#x27;t tried the wet shaving, and I don&#x27;t intend to. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the first electric shaver that does what electric shavers are supposed to do: cut both short and long hairs quickly and cleanly. I have had many, many other electric shavers in the last half century, but I&#x27;d give all of them a grade of C- to F, particularly when it comes to cutting long hairs. Not this puppy. It works beautifully. And it&#x27;s fast. I used to spend 5 minutes shaving. Now in two minutes I&#x27;m done. And long hairs are dealt with as easily as short. The long hair trimmer is the Achilles Heel of most shavers. Either it&#x27;s not efficient at cutting long hairs, or it&#x27;s flimsy and breaks within a year or so. The Panasonic ES8078S is excellent in the first respect, and appears to be more robust in the second. I&#x27;ve had it only a month, so the jury is still out on longevity, but even in the unlikely event it lasts only a year, I&#x27;d buy another one, it&#x27;s that good. This is also the first self-cleaning shaver I&#x27;ve had. Cartridges of the liquid cleaner are $4 each, but they last a month, and they&#x27;re worth it. If you don&#x27;t want to spend the $4, you can wash the shaver under the tap, with or without liquid soap. The shaver also recharges without the base unit (from 110V or 220V) so it&#x27;s great for traveling. It takes 3 hours to recharge, which is a bit long, but when do you want to shave at intervals of less than 3 hours? I&#x27;d give this shaver a grade of A+.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8078S Vortex HydraClean Wet/Dry shaver to replace an old Norelco Spectra shaver rather than buy replacement shaving heads.  Since my Norelco shaver was several years old, I figured a newer shaver might offer a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vortex HydraClean shaver is quite versatile.  You can dry-shave with it or, for a closer, more comfortable shave, you can wet-shave with some shaving cream.  The shaver is waterproof, so it can be used in the bath or shower.  There is a switch that enables you to adjust the shaving head so it will either be rigid or move up and down as it is pressed against your face.  I found this feature to be pretty useless.  There are no adjustments for closeness of shave.  Compared with my old Spectra, dry-shaving with the Panasonic Vortex was a big disappointment.  The shave was mediocre at best, which I found most surprising after reading all of the glowing reviews about this shaver.  My Spectra dry-shaves closer with dull blades.  But the wet-shave with the Panasonic Vortex is as close as a razor.  I honestly did not believe any shaver could shave as close as a razor, but this one can if you use shaving cream.  Which begs the question: why would you want to use a shaver instead of a razor (which would be far less expensive and easier to clean and maintain) if you are going to use shaving cream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can be charged with the AC adapter separately or you can place the shaver in an included holder that will clean, dry, and charge your shaver automatically.  A single charge is estimated to last for 2 weeks of shaving, so travel is possible without taking the charger.  The holder can be programmed to perform different automatic functions: charge only; dry only; clean &amp; dry only; dry &amp; charge only; and clean, dry, &amp; charge.  The full cycle of clean, dry, and charge takes about 3 hours to complete.  It is also quite noisy -- you do not want to do this while someone is trying to sleep nearby.  The cleaning system uses a special cleaning cartridge that must be purchased separately (the shaving system comes with one cartridge).  Each cartridge will last about 30 days before it must be replaced.  Oddly, the cleaning cartridge will not last any longer if you don&#x27;t clean your shaver every day -- it will last only the same amount of time.  So you may as well clean your shaver every day.  You won&#x27;t save any money by doing otherwise.  Replacement cartridges sell in packs of three for around $12-15 (they are hard to find -- it seems they are perpetually out of stock at most online retailers, including Amazon).  So it costs about $50/year to use this shaving system to its full potential.  If you prefer not to spend your money on cleaning cartridges, you can clean the shaver with liquid hand soap and water.  Obviously, this is not as handy as simply sticking the shaver in its holder for automatic cleaning.  A replacement foil and blade set for the Panasonic Vortex shaver currently costs about $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to shave in the shower or, for some inexplicable reason, want to use a shaver with shaving cream, you will likely be very happy with the Panasonic Vortex shaver.  It will shave as close as a razor.  If you are planning to shave dry, however, compared with other premium shavers like the Norelco Spectra you will likely be disappointed with the Panasonic Vortex shaver.  It remains to be seen whether or not the Panasonic Vortex will be worth $100/year added cost in cleaning solution and new foil/blades.  I suspect it will not.special cleaning cartridge that must be purchased separately (the shaving system comes with one cartridge).  Each cartridge will last about 30 days before it must be replaced.

    <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my son. He loves the close shave it gives him, the ease of use, and the cleaning system. He has no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> How does it shave?  So-so. No better than any cheap electric I have ever owned.  I bought this because I lead a life with deadlines and the thought of not having to clean a razor appealled to me.  So I bought one with a self-cleaning system.  Forget it.    I am not convinced the cleaning system has ever worked.  I clean it manually, and take my word, a \\&quot;back-and-forth\\&quot; system is MUCH more difficult to clean manually than a rotary.  There are places you just can&#x27;t reach.  There are also places that look like they&#x27;d break if I tried to clean them.    Don&#x27;t buy this for the self-cleaning system; it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco&#x27;s for years and years, but it seems that they are not what they used to be. Saw this one on sale and thought I would give it a try. Fabulous razor that is built right and takes me much less time to shave compared to the round blade shavers. Only complaint - I wish there was some kind of indicator that tells you it is time to change the soap container.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver based upon other reviews I had read.  Botom line is when used dry it gets very close but you can still feel some stuuble.  When used wet with shave cream it&#x27;s almost as good as a Mach 3 blade and gel.  But if you want a completely smooth head nothing beats a Mach 3 blade when used with a gel.    This shaver works great in-between those blade shaves when a perfectly smooth scalp is not necessary.  I give it a thumbs up !!</li>
    <li> and i love kissing him now that his face is smooth.  he had a self-cleaning braun razor that seemed good at the time, but does not hold a candle to this guy.  it&#x27;s wet dry, so you can use it in the shower, with shaving cream, producing such a clean, smooth shave.    he also loves the tacky charging/drying station (even though it takes up a lot of space on the counter and puts on laser show if i ever wander in at night).  the design could not be more stereotypically male, equal parts sports car and gi joe.  and the box describes the shaver as \\&quot;linear\\&quot; and \\&quot;curve\\&quot; all in one breath.  foofy but fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a razor blade pretty much all my life - first a Gilette, then I downgraded to Bic.    After an operation that left me terrified to use a naked blade on my skin (healing scar etc), I switched to an electric shaver and plumped for this one.    It&#x27;s only been two days, but I am amazed with the results.  I find the wet shave leaves my skin SMOOTHER than a razor blade: previously I had real trouble with my upper lip and the blade, but this thing has no problems.  And I&#x27;m not left with little cuts that turn into spots a couple of days later.    All in all, very pleased, would recommend to anyone thinking of converting from blade to electric.</li>
    <li> I started using this razor a few weeks ago, it is great, It shaves closer thatn my old rotary shaver, I have only used dry so far.   I use it to shave my head and it does a great job, slthough you need some patience to get it to a smooth finish. (althouhg it is a lot less painfull thatn shaving with a razor)   the cleaner charger, seems OK, but I fell like I wasted some money, because you can clean the shaver very easy by turning it on with some hand soap and water. when I use the cleaner/charger it only lasted a little over a week before I had to replace the cleaning cartridge. (it would be too expensive to replace the cartridge so often. now I wash it my self and only use the cleaner once in a while.</li>
    <li> Update after 3 weeks. The cleaning system barely cleans. The only way I can shave my neck is to run several passes in different directions to get it all.    -----------------------------------------------  I&#x27;ve only shaved with this razor 4 times so far.  The first time, I shaved wet, with regular shaving cream. It was very messy and took a very long time. I also slashed my neck in a few places rather bad.  But, the shave was very smooth.    Second time, I shaved dry and this was when I realised that this shaver works well only when shaving against the grain ! This is my first electric shaver and all my life I&#x27;ve never shaved against the grain as I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with in-grown hair roots on my face.    Third time I shaved wet and it still was very messy and took about 15 mins to shave. Got a couple cuts as well but pretty minor    Now I only shave dry as it takes about 5 - 8 mins and I don&#x27;t get any cuts either. The only thing that is painful is that I have to shave against the grain for it to even work. This makes it very hard to use on the neck as I have hair growing in many different directions thus requiring me to go back and forth repeatedly in several directions and angles to get a smooth shave.    The cleaning apparatus makes a hell of a noise and does not clean that well either. Just soap and running water does a better job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have been converted. For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type of razor, but now I find it&#x27;s not the best shave. I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn&#x27;t shave often. (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had. The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow. My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different and when Itold him, he went out and bought one too, he also loves it now. My fiancé said she would leave me if I stopped using the Panasonic, it&#x27;s a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles. The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it, I have charged it twice but it really didn&#x27;t need it as it said the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don&#x27;t think it can get any better. Ohh yea and as for which model to choose from, they are all good, the difference in price and model number is whether it comes with the cleaning base, which I do recommend, and how it displays the battery status. Splurge as little or as much as you want. The product&#x27;s quality doesn&#x27;t change. But look at it this way, if your going to keep it for a couple of years, why not get a nicer model now?</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading many glowing reviews.  I would like to add my own positive review to the others.  It&#x27;s nice when a product meets your expectations and this razor has done that.  When other&#x27;s said it shaved as close as a blade, I took it with a grain of salt.  They were right!  I&#x27;ve shaved with this razor a number of times so far: no breaking in period needed for me, and closer shaves than I could achieve with a razor and shaving cream.  Lastly, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about expensive razor blades ever again.  I don&#x27;t know if going electric is a carbon neutral move, but it has to be close considering all of the plastic and metal used for razor blades and their packaging.</li>
    <li> Electric shavers cannot give as close a shave as so called safety razors; having said that, I am pleased with the Wet/Dry Vortex HydraClean razor.  It does a very good job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND, HE HAS A CLOSER SHAVE NOW THAN EVER. GREAT PRODUCT, LIKE ALL NEW RAZORS TAKES SOME TIME FOR SKIN TO ADAPT. CLOSENESS, SELF CLEANING, AND QUALITY MAKE THIS A GREAT RAZOR. I CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS, CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS SHAVER.</li>
    <li> When I was considering this buy I was very keen on wet shaving option. However, when I did tried it out I didn&#x27;t really notice any better shave. I used to use Braun 7505 for 3 years and I would say that shaving quality is comparable between the two.</li>
    <li> Quite simply this is the best electric razor I have ever owned. I am extremely pleased with it. I had previously owned several Norelcos but feel that I get a much better shave with the Panasonic. I think the best feature is the wet-dry capability. I feel that this gives me a much closer and more comfortable shave. When I am finished I feel as though I shaved with a blade without the accompanying irritation.  I also chose this razor because of the holder which includes both charging and cleaning capabilities. It charges very quickly and holds the charge well. The cleaning seems to be very efficient. The only negayive comment that I have so far is the coxt of the cleaning cartridges which several other reviewers have mentioned. I do not think it needs to be cleaned as often as Panasonic suggests which should help some.  In summaryt. I feel that this is an outstanding product. I am impressed with its features, the price and the speed with which the order was filled.</li>
    <li> I had given up on trying to find an electric razor for several years now. Then, I had to go to a convention where daily shaving would be required. Daily blade shaving was not an option for me as it would tear up my face unless I waited at least two days between shaves. The manual razor I used is the Gilette Fusion, which I personally found to be the best of them all for me.&lt;br /&gt;So, after reading several reviews on this model, I decided to give it one more try. I am VERY glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what some of the negative reviewers are talking about at all. I have not had to give it any time at all for my face to become used to it, and I get a very confortable and close shave with both dry and wet in-the-shower shaves with this unit using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a solid fan of electric shavers, and when the time comes to replace this one, I will undoubtedly buy another like it.&lt;br /&gt;At upwards of $3 per blade for the Fusion, it won&#x27;t take long for this to pay for itself even considering the cleaning solution refils.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had, shaving with foam and water is very nice. The final result is almost like a razor. I have had other shavers like the standard braun or phillips, and this is just much much better. I cannot say if this is better than the more expensive Braun models, as I have not tried one of those.     I would not change back to the dry shavers the feeling of shaving with foam is just really good.     UPDATE: my uodeated score would be THREE STARS. The shaver works well at the beginning, but the blades degrade quite fast and are very expensive. I realizaed that no electrical machine can beat a traditional gillette shaver. Even a good friend who is using a Braun electric shaver told me that he has to use a hand shaver on some spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these... 1 for my dad for Fathers Day and 1 for myself. I tried out my Dad&#x27;s first because I wanted to see how well it worked before I purchased mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His worked REALLY GOOD! Simple to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine? Not so much... it&#x27;s weird. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re two totally different razors and mine must be broke or something because it does NOT clean itself. I guess I have the warranty but we know how those work...</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing since sliced bread!  I have sensitive skin, and this product works great for me.  Don&#x27;t even think twice about buying this shaver!</li>
    <li> I bought the ES8078S at the beginning of December and let me tell you I will not go back to blades again.  This electric razor has been flawless.  On my face, it truly does shave closer than a blade. I can now shave everyday instead of every other day I would shave with the blade due to sensitive skin.  I am still shaving on the initial charge and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the battery&#x27;s stamina.  I do use the Hydra Cleaning System everyday so in the morning the razor is always fresh and clean.  The Hydra Cleaning System does a great job and the cleaning cartridges last about 30 days.  I just changed out my 1st one today.  I have nothing bad to say about this razor...It is a masterpiece!  Buy this razor; you can&#x27;t beat the price and you can&#x27;t beat this razor!!!</li>
    <li> this product is a very good product for the price, in my opinion, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a definite steal. It comes with everything and has all the features you need to remove the restrictions of normal shavers. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver was a great purchase.  My husband really likes it.  He says it&#x27;s the best shaver and shave he has had in awhile.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes electric shavers.  This replaced a previous Panasonic that got worn out.</li>
    <li> This razor still lives up to Panasonic&#x27;s great quality and a great shave.  &lt;br /&gt;I have owned a Panasonic razor for years. It is the best razor I have ever owned. Actually my old Panasonic is still working. I never have changed the blade or foil. I just wanted to change. I truly don&#x27;t understand why Panasonic&#x27;s razors are everywhere. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have bought many razors in my lifetime, 72+ years, and have never experienced a better shave than this little beauty.  It is just perfect for the every other day shave when one is retired and could replace my four blade razor that gives a very close shave, but this does not leave tender areas that you know you have to put up with for that day.  This is the best product that I have seen on the market.  Kudos for Panasonic.  J. Foley, San Jose, Ca.</li>
    <li> First ordered using Amazon Free Super Saver Shipping, but afterward realized it would be several days before they even filled the order let alone shipped the product, which might then still take another week or two to arrive. (Not an issue if you&#x27;re not in a rush of course).  Changed the order to 2-day shipping (cost me $12.47 extra) and the product was shipped the next day and I picked it up the day after that.  Amazon&#x27;s price was the best I could find, especially compared to Canadian prices if you could even find that model &#x27;up here\\&quot; (which I couldn&#x27;t).  Huge saving.      (For any Canadian&#x27;s, Amazon will only ship to an American address.  I&#x27;m fortunate to live near the border so just had the shaver shipped to a mail drop service across the line, then went down and picked it up.  Customs didn&#x27;t even charge me any import taxes when I declared it at the border so the entire package ran just over $100 including U.S. taxes and shipping.  Half what it would have cost in Canada.)    Have used a Panasonic ES8066 13.000rpm shaver for several years, so pretty much knew what I was getting with the ES8078.  The ES8078 seems a bit more \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; than the old ES8066 and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;substantial\\&quot; in the hand.  Only time will tell if it proves as robust. Hopefully I won&#x27;t ever drop it to find out.  And on that note, the shaver \\&quot;fits\\&quot; well in the hand and seems easy to hang on to.  Oh, and the ES8078 on/off switch is an \\&quot;electronic\\&quot; button which you press and hold for a moment to start the shaver, rather than a physical switch you slide up and down as in the old ES8066.  (Holding the button a couple seconds puts the shaver into 17,000rpm cleaning mode, something which I don&#x27;t plan to use).    The shave is as wonderful as the old Panasonic shaver (well, actually a considerable improvement as my old one was on its last legs).  The 13,000rpm motor provides a great shave as was also evident with the old ES8066.  I was a long time Braun user for many years before converting to the Panasonic ES8066 and have never looked back.  At the time, the ES8066 was a far better built unit than the Braun shavers, but with the ES8078 much lighter plastic build it may well be more equivalent to the Brauns now in build quality.    The ES8078&#x27;s flexible shave head does seem to provide a somewhat more comfortable shave experience over my older ES8066&#x27;s stationary head.  As well as the shaver head pivoting and springing up and down, the blades inside the ES8078 even flex up and down and tip end to end within the shave head itself.  I use the shaver dry on both face and head with equally good results.  Can get my head smooth as glass when I take my time to go over it leaving no \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; feel.  Surprisingly only takes a few minutes to do.  (And of course you are free to wander about or sit at the computer or what have you while shaving.)    I&#x27;ve only once tried shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with the old Panasonic, but found it equally as irritating to my face as shaving with a razor blade which of course I was trying to avoid, so have stuck ever since with dry shave.    I&#x27;m sure if I stuck with the wet shave my skin might get accustomed, but with getting such a great dry shave there&#x27;s no need.    The ES8078 charges up very fast.  The unit sports a single Li-ion battery, and of course the Linear motor puts out 13,000rpm no matter what the battery level might be, which is a nice feature over razors that tend to slow down as the battery drains, or which tend to \\&quot;bog down\\&quot; when dealing with heavy growth areas.  My old ES8066 is still functioning fine on its original batteries after all these years, and it has spent almost all of its life sitting in its induction charging stand when not in use, so Panasonic&#x27;s claim that the battery won&#x27;t be damaged or over-charged if left in the charger appear to be correct.    As far as the new ES8078&#x27;s charging stand/cleaner, I don&#x27;t plan to use it as is far easier to simply rinse the shaver under the tap after a shave, and when it needs charging just plug in the included A/C charger.  (Plus I don&#x27;t have the extra space on the counter for the stand/cleaner.)    One reviewer complained about having to shave \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; to get a good shave (or any shave at all) with this shaver.  For anyone else wondering about the issue, this is exactly how ALL electric shavers work.  Unlike a regular razor blade or straight razor  which can cut hairs at the skin while shaving no matter which direction you \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; with the blade, all electric shavers MUST go \\&quot;against\\&quot; the grain to enable the hairs to slip into the tiny holes in the shaving foil so that the blades inside the foil can then cut the hairs off as they stick through the screen.  Unfortunately there&#x27;s no other way around it.    I hope some of this ramble might help someone in their own shaver decision, as the other reviews here helped me decide in my own purchase, so thought I&#x27;d try and respond in kind.</li>
    <li> The shaver gives probably the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver.  Time will tell how long this lasts as my previous electrics (mostly panasonics) had blades and foils that worked well at first, but then shaves became quickly less and less close.  Maybe the cleaning system will help the situation and extend their life as the blades and foil costs seem to be inordinately high, and replacement must occur more than than the recommended every 12 months.</li>
    <li> This shaver gets you a great smooth shave. I have had it for 8 months now. I had a severe rash the first time I used it but settled down in a few days.  Unlike blades it does not lift and cut the hairs, so as a result your face tends to have a slight shadow although it feels smooth. This may be more pronounced in men with dark facial hair.  You can extend the life of the cartridge by unplugging the cleaning system after the cleaning cycle  and also by removing the outer foil and rinsing the head in water for a few seconds before putting the shaver in for a clean. Cartridges cost $5 and each one lasts for about 6-8 weeks.  June 2010. After 3 years my shaver has started to die. the battery does not hold charge even for a few minutes of shaving. The self cleaning system ceased functioning a year ago. I am using it only for drying and charging. About to buy a new shaver...thinking Remington.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to point out the difference between the ES8078S &amp; the ES8077S - the 78 is silver&#x27;ish/gray, while the 77 is gold&#x27;ish/bronze. No idea why Panasonic doesn&#x27;t feel this information is necessary, as a consumer I find this little tidbit quite important &amp; I think it is really strange that they don&#x27;t list the color difference in the specifications, not even on their main website. Personally I much prefer the more neutral silver/gray type color scheme, but people aren&#x27;t even given a chance to make the choice when the info is MIA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor yields the usual Panasonic quality shave, much nicer than any triple head razor, in my opinion. I find those type to not only miss a lot of hairs, but they tend to pull the hair which can be a little less than pleasant, hence I gave up on them many years ago &amp; have been using the Panasonic Linear for about 10 years. My last Panasonic held up all that time &amp; would still be fine now, but the battery finally stopped holding a charge, so I chose the ES8078S as a replacement. I have never used the Braun or other similar brands so cannot directly compare, but the Panasonic&#x27;s have always had the fastest motors (13,000 RPM) &amp; the wet/dry feature which is quite convenient for thoroughly washing the razor, even if you prefer to shave dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built in cleaning system works well enough, though I don&#x27;t like the smell of the cleaning solution very much myself, but it&#x27;s not really bad &amp; doesn&#x27;t actually bother me. The quality of the construction &amp; materials is very good, I find no faults here, however, I feel like the indicator lighting scheme could have been better designed. 1) I feel it is backwards that the razor continuously flashes red AFTER it is fully charged. I believe a flashing red light should indicate that something is wrong or that it is in charging mode, not that it is fully charged &amp; ready to go? In my opinion it would make much better sense if it would either have a solid green light, or simply turn off the light when it&#x27;s charged 2) There is an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; charging option when selecting between the various cleaning/drying options. This is completely redundant as far as I can tell, since the razor automatically charges anytime it is placed in the base no matter what, whether you select a cleaning cycle or not, so I&#x27;m not sure what it is doing there. Also, again with the flashing lights, this time they&#x27;re green, but I do feel it would be more appropriate for the lights to either go solid or turn off when the cleaning cycle is complete, rather than continuously flash, which to me indicates some type of activity rather than a completed cycle. So to really summarize on this lighting situation in case anyone from Panasonic might be reading this, flashing lights definitely seem backwards, any flashing should be occurring during activity, not afterwards when the unit is all set to standby indefinitely, at which time the lights should either go solid, or off. With as many different lights as there are on the unit, I can think of several different ways that would seem right to do it, but definitely flashing after charging or cleaning is complete, seems wrong. My previous Panasonic, though a little less complex with the lights, would show red while charging, then green when charged, seems much more logical. I&#x27;ve even thought of opening up the unit &amp; disconnecting the red flashing light, but I don&#x27;t really want to have to alter it, it just looks all wrong for it to ALWAYS be flashing red when it&#x27;s sitting around fully charged &amp; ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the unit 5 stars based on the shave alone, but since there are a few things about the product that I feel could have been done better or are simply backwards, I feel a 4 is more appropriate in this case.it&#x27;s charged 2) There is an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; charging option when selecting between the various cleaning/drying options.

    <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy facial hair, but my early attempts using electric razors always proved unsatisfactory.  I thought I was doomed to scrapes and nicks from blade razors the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Amazon.com advertised the Panasonic E80785 in their \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deals\\&quot; at a very tempting price.  To me, this means that this model has been upgraded with a new model.  Anyway, I checked the reviews and decided to get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  This is a really great electric razor.  Even when used dry it produces good results.  But, when used wet, it is a dream fulfilled!  After only a few days of use, my face feels softer and smoother - even my old wrinkled turkey neck is gently and cleanly shaved.  I also really like the self cleaning feature, the cordless feature, number of shaves between necessary charges, and the high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, using a razor like this does cost more money than the old blade types.  But if you love yourself at all, the obsolete Panasonic ES80785 should be high on your list of priorities - or the newest replacement model if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is absolutely lovely. It is the exact same thing as the ES8077S. The difference is the color of the shaver (77 is gold, 78 is silver). This is my first electric shaver and I am happy to say that it has been one of the greatest investments Ive ever made. It shaves wonderfully more or less everywhere. The real trick to shaving the problem areas, like your neck, is going over it at different directions (diagonal, horizonal, vertical and also going backwards). I have very sensitive skin and even when going over an area multiple times I get almost no irritation. The first time I used it it was somewhat bothersome and didnt get as much hair as I wanted it too. As time passes your face adjusts and it seems that either it shaved the hairs better, or I just learned to shave in a more effective manner. The cleaning base is rather loud if you do the actual cleaning cycle, but I find using soap and water to be just as effective and then just doing the dry/charge cycle, which is much quieter. This electric razor pretty much is a wonderful product that gets the job done and does not break the bank. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, quick shave with little or no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco, Remington, and Braun, and this Panasonic blows them all away.  It is quiet, fast, and easy on my skin from day 1.  I used to dread shaving if I skipped a day, because of the pulling, but this Panny  wisks everything right off, no tugging or pulling.  And it shaves so much closer!  I used to think that I had a fast-growing beard.  No, not really--I just never had a really close shave before!  (I can&#x27;t stand shaving with a manual razor, so I am not comparing it to that).  Sometimes, I feel I can almost skip a day and it wouldn&#x27;t matter too much.  But I don&#x27;t need to, cause it works so fast, that I&#x27;m done in one pass (two for the tough spots where I have hair growing in different directions). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downside: the cleaning cycle is loud and lengthy.  But as long as someone is not in the ajoining bedroom trying to sleep (Oops!  Sorry honey!!!), who cares!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy this excellent product!!</li>
    <li> It took the full month of trial time for my beard to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to this shaver, but now that it has, I&#x27;m pleased with the performance.  I&#x27;ve used Remingtons and Norelcos in the past and had found that the circular cutting of the norelco did a more complete job at really getting at all the hairs from all the angles than foil shavers.  But I&#x27;d heard so many good things about the Panasonics that I had to give it a try.  The flat skin areas (i.e. side burn and under the chin) are a bit tough to really get smooth.  No matter what motion I use (stright lines, circular buffing motion, etc), I still end up with a little stubble - but just a very little.  But the chin itself and mustache area are very easy to get as close as a blade.  I tried it dry, with water and with water and shaving cream.  My skin seems too moist or oily in the mornings to be able to shave it dry - the foil sort of bounces along the skin rather than make a smooth swipe.  So that didn&#x27;t work for me - tho will do in a pinch if I need to shave in the car due to an an alarm clock issue. Just water while in the shower produced similar results.  But a thin layer of shaving cream and you really can&#x27;t beat the results.  I&#x27;d suggest this shaver to anyone with the reservation that you will need to buy a cleaning cartridge every couple of months (not a big deal... around $4 each) and plan on - from what I&#x27;ve read - buying a new foil in one to two years.  But that&#x27;s the same for any shavor.  Panasonic used a nickel metal hydride battery so there aren&#x27;t any \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; issues or other problems associated with NiCD batteries, which is good.</li>
    <li> You get better reesults by just buying the razor, rinsing it off and adding a light coating of shaver lubricant. Shaver itself is good but not asd good as past models.</li>
    <li> I have a very light beard and have always wet shaved or used a Norelco.  I got interested in the Braun Pulseonic, but it was kinda pricy.  I settled for the Vortex.  I am not sure about the logic of a wet electric shaver, so I have not used that feature.  As a dry shaver, however, I am very disappointed.  It takes forever.  I have to shave over a spot over and over again to get a clean shave.  And I have an extremely hard time shaving under my chin.  I wish I had stuck to Norelco.    Second review:  Just before I ditched this shaver, I decided to try wet shaving.  I had never wet shaved with an electric shaver before.  I was pleasently surprised.  It gave a smooth, clean, close shave.  Not ulike what you get with a regular razor, so I&#x27;m still not sure about the logic.  But since I&#x27;ve already bought it, I guess I&#x27;ll keep it.  Incidentally, the manual cleaning is much faster, quieter, and effective.  I clean it manually, then place it in the charger to dry only.</li>
    <li> I have tried at least six electric shavers of four different brands over the years, and always return to blades. It seems that all shavers are great out of the box, then within a couple of weeks, seem less than ideal as the cutting heads begin to dull.    I have used this one for six months now, and I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because it is made in CHINA, and I am on a boycott anything I can from China kick.I can honestly say that after six months I am as happy with the shaver as I was the first time. I have used it both wet and dry and love it both ways. Before buying this one, I would \\&quot;dry shave\\&quot; with a blade after using my Braun shaver to get what was missed.    My two complaints are that it is Chinese made, and after six months, the automatic cleaning base no longer works, so I rinse it under the faucet now. I guess my \\&quot;China equals junk\\&quot; theory will be realized sooner rather than later, but the shaver still works great.....for now.</li>
    <li> I bought this product being a previous Panasonic owner and reading reviews. This razor is a bargain when purchased online and not available at all stores. The motor is much quicker than any other Panasonic I&#x27;ve used. It gets five stars for its kind of razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this style of razor for shaving neck hairs that go in every direction, but it is going to blow away everything else for shaving just the face. It&#x27;s sometimes better than a straight razor and you can shave more than once a day without irritation. I don&#x27;t use the cleaning cartriges and have not ever inserted mine and also removed the water tank for better looks. My razor has held the first charge and is still going since exactly one month ago. Amazing. I don&#x27;t have to leave it plugged in.</li>
    <li> Well, I have used a Panasonic \\&quot;Smooth Operator\\&quot; razor for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I might replace it with a brand new (and expensive) Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my new razor I was really surprised. It&#x27;s a cheap, lightweight piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shave is nowhere near as good as my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get my $$ back.&lt;br /&gt;It just sits there, collecting dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a step backwards for Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Shaver is all that I expected.  Ergonomic, shaves like a dream (better than my old Braun).  The cleaning system makes it so easy to care for!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As happy owner of a previous Panasonic rechargerable shaver aqnd I can say this is an even better shaver.  I runs much faster, quieter and the flexible head allows it to be more comfortable at different shaving angles. Having a medium weight beard this gives me a smooth, satisfying shave. This is the first time I have had a self cleaning shaver and I am impresses with it as well.  I would recommend this shaver highly.</li>
    <li> While not as close as shaving with a blade, this electric razor does a fine job and is so comfortable to use. I have owned Braun and Remingtons in the past but neither was as smooth to use. The cleaning system works well too. I would recommend this product if you are looking for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Panasonic razors and I have a had quite a few wet/dry models.  This is by far the best.  Close shave, quiet, minimal razor burn. &lt;br /&gt;The model just before this had issues with the cleaner/charger/holder but they fixed those issues with this model.  I recommend it if you like electric and you like wet/dry.</li>
    <li> I could go on and on about how great I think this shaver is. But to get right to the point, it is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in 20 years of shaving. As stated in the instructions, your skin needs to get used to it but after that happens (like a week of use), wet or dry, it is fabulous.  &lt;br /&gt;If you get a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow, this may be a problem. I don&#x27;t think you get as close of a shave with electric as you do a razor but I can&#x27;t use a razor without lots of irritation. This thing is so easy on my skin, I can shave twice a day if need be. Wet or dry, it works! &lt;br /&gt;Yes, the charger/cleaner is loud and I don&#x27;t know if it will become a problem having to buy the cleaning replacements over the long haul. But for now, I have to say this is the best personal care product I have ever owned. Being able to actually shave every day is just short of a miracle.</li>
    <li> I researched thoroughly before settling on this gem.  I&#x27;ve been using it for four months now, and here is my perspective.    **The good**  Superb wet shave  Decent dry shave alone  Superb dry shave with talc (e.g. Remington Face Saver)  Trimmer works great for maintaining sideburns, goatees, etc.  Easy cleaning by hand; cleaning system works well  Dock can do any combination of clean/dry/charge  Can charge with the cord alone  Charge lasts a very long time  Spouse can use it  Blades are still sharp as ever  Cleaning cartridge refills inexpensive and last a full 3 months  Great value for price and then some    **The not so good**  More prone to nicks when shaving wet (I do have sensitive skin, though)  Shavings stick to skin during a wet shave, requiring frequent rinsing (unless using in the shower)  Charger/cleaner trips bathroom GFCI (outlet), so I have to plug it in elsewhere (it may simply the outlet&#x27;s fault...pun intended)  Cleaning cycle is loud enough that you wouldn&#x27;t want to start it before bedtime    **Other*  To elaborate some of the above...  When my wife and I went on vacation, I took this without the charger or cord.  She actually ended up using it (dry), too, and it worked well for her.  We both used it numerous times over ten days and the charge didn&#x27;t fade one bit.    If you&#x27;re familiar with the Hydra from Greek mythology, you&#x27;ll understand why I think \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; is a funny/poor product name.    **Verdict**  In all, I think you&#x27;re more likely than not to be pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have purchase and used several shavers over the years, including Norelco and Braun; I find this shaver to be the best so far.  It does a nice job with my tough beard.    A couple of things to keep in mind -- 1) it does not beat shaving the traditional way with a razor; 2) when wet, it tends to lose performance!</li>
    <li> I do recommend it for anyone with acne or other sensitive skin condition, good quality shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for just about a year now after buying it as an Amazon Gold Box special. The blade is due for replacement, but I believe it&#x27;s time to move along to another machine.    The pros:   It&#x27;s inexpensive as far as decent electric razors go.    The shaving head is shaped to allow the razor to get in everywhere. I prefer the closeness of Norelco razors, but that edge that surrounds the discs on all of them prevents the razor from being able to get under my nose.    It provides a decent shave over most of my face, a passable shave over part of it, and a horrible shave over other parts.      The cons:  If I don&#x27;t pre-clean the head before using the HydraClean base, the cartridge is only good for about eight uses.  With pre-cleaning by holding the running unit under water with the cap off and rinsing the cap, the cartridges last a month or so.      After a bit shy of a year, the head is starting to dull. Now, it pulls instead of cuts (ouch!).    It&#x27;s very slow.  I have to pass the razor over certain areas of my face upwards of a dozen times from various directions to get a smooth shave. I can shave with a regular razor and wash off the excess shaving cream in close to half the time it takes to shave with this razor.    The cleaning cycle takes forever.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the Panasonic has run more while being cleaned than it has while actually shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Norelco three blade rotary razor.  I never used this type of razor and have read its better and smother for sensitive skin so I decided to give it a try.  When I first turned it on (at 4:30am) my dog went crazy barking which woke the wife.  It&#x27;s has a high pitch buzzing which is much louder than the Norelco.  It is smoother on the skin only because it doesn&#x27;t cut very well (except for the crack of my mouth when I tried to get shave close).  It&#x27;s hard to maneuver around the mouth and under the nose and leaves a considerable amount of uncut hair, especially on the neck.  I have no opinion on the self cleaning.  I guess it works but so did pulling the head off my Norelco and running under the water in the sink.  I was excited after reading reviews on this razor however after using it for about a month I can now say I am very disappointed and am considering pulling out the old Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is another great shaver by Panasonic. It shaves very close and was comfortable from the first day. Make sure you continue to buy the cartridges to clean the shaver to keep it working like new. The linear motor in the shaver makes all of the difference in the world. My first shaver had a linear motor. I replaced it with one that did not and it did not shave nearly as good as this one. If you want a great shaver, this is one to consider.</li>
    <li> i have used this before, during, and after a shower, with and without shaving cream, and i always get a great shave.  plus, it looks really cool.</li>
    <li> I tried every manual razor on the market, the Gellette Fusion was pretty nice but it clogged up with hair pretty quick and was a pain to get the hair out. Also I went thru &#x27;em at a decent rate, I had to find a good electric.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the closeness of a good Fusion type blade, but something that was easier to clean, and didn&#x27;t require replacement every other week was what I wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In comes the Panasonic Vortex, now they have a lot of different models,. all close in # and close in price.  This is the one I went went based off the most reviews on here.  I am very pleased with it, it misses a few spots on my neck, and for a few days it irratated my skin and left red marks. But I&#x27;ve adjusted and loving it. I&#x27;ve read others complaining it&#x27;s loud, doesn&#x27;t seem bad to me (more of a buzz then outright loud) the charging is kind of annoyingly loud if you&#x27;re around it when it&#x27;s happening. And it&#x27;s sloooow, but it does it&#x27;s thing.  Overall it gets very close to my skin, and is fast.  It grows back much faster then when I used a straight razor, but I use it every morning so that&#x27;s not an issue. Takes me 30 seconds in the shower to touch it up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My facial hair is very thick and coarse, everyone has different facial hair so this shaver will obviously not give exact results across the board. But I figure with hair as bad as mine if it works for me, most people should have it cut close for them. Now skin sensitivity is a whole nother subject, my skin is sort of sensitive, but much less than others I know. I don&#x27;t notice much burn, it&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable initally after I&#x27;m done shaving, but it goes away quick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;overall I&#x27;d give this a 4.5 if I could, I would LOVE to try out the new Vortex II shavers with the new cleaning system, but for what it costs this is awesome. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Shick Quattro and never thought I would find an electric razor that could cut as close as a blade.  Based on the reviews I read, I decided to take a chance.  When I received this razor, I charged it and used it on a 3-day stubble.  No irration or razor rash -- I was amazed.  I have a dark beard and could probably shave twice a day, but this razor went right through three days worth of growth.  I think the cleaning/charging/drying selector is pure genius.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received my razor promptly and well packaged.  The product itself is great and love the self-clean feature.  It provides a close, comfortable shave and will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I had a vortex shaver (previous version) before and I was very happy with it. It died after 2 years and I had to buy a new one. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have finally found an electric shaver that works! It gets as close to a razor shave as you can get. I like that you can use the self cleaning mode or use some soap and water. I prefer to use soap and water and save the self cleaning for twice a month. The only thing that might, and I repeat might, be a set back is that it runs a little loud. Other than that it is a perfect razor.</li>
    <li> If you are a person who gets bumps from shaving against the grain but looking for a better cleaner shave, avoid this electric.  Contrary to what Panasonic may claim, this razor will actually tear your face apart.  My entire face is now irritated from razor burn and it is somewhat painful.  Good luck in your search.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but even with greatness comes caveats. First thing is first, this product works but NOT right away. It took around 3 weeks for the shave to come out right, before then I looked liked a half-shaven monster. I recommend shaving right AFTER a shower, because your whiskers are standing up.     After the \\&quot;conversion\\&quot; to electric I am believer. Shaves are just as fast as  razor and ALMOST as smooth. There are still rough spots that won&#x27;t come off, but thats the tradeoff for being able to shave anywhere. I share a bathroom with 4 other people, and I can not afford to stay and shave with a razor all the time. Being able to shave in my room and just as quickly is great. I shaved for a good 10 years before I got this product, and I am just as happy as I was before.    Pros:   -convenient, shave anywhere easily  -save money on razors and shaving cream( although you can use shaving cream, there really is no difference)  -relatively cheap for a high quality electric  -easy to clean using soap and water under a tap  -less irritation in long run    Cons  -not as smooth as a razor, might still have spots  -adapting takes time, up to 4 weeks  - need to \\&quot;rub\\&quot; your skin with the electric for it to work(can be irritation for some, but eventually it feels smoother)  -doesn&#x27;t work that well in shower      One last recommendation is to use some sort of finishing lotion to make your face feel better after a shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading about it online.  For once, what I read was actually true.  This is a great product.  It really does shave as close as a blade. The price wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
    <li> Was looking at Norelco (pricey) but came across this and purchased it based on the reviews of others. I absolutly love this shaver. I use it in the shower evey day and simply rinse it out under the shower head. It shaves as close as my old Gillett Mach 3 razor. I havn&#x27;t used the cleaning system yet as rinsing the soap out of it after each use works just as good. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver. Also holds a charge for nearly 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had and been using this for about 3 weeks now from this review.  I can&#x27;t say too much as far as durability and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is, it&#x27;s allowed me to shave more often with more comfort.  Previously, I was trying to shave as infrequently as I could get away with due to my facial hairs being so thick.  I don&#x27;t have it Grizzly Adams style, but what I do have is thick.  I typically would have to wait a few days so that shaving with a regular razor would be easy on my skin and therefore, less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be as close as a blade, but dangit if it doesn&#x27;t give me about a 95%+ close shave.  It actually takes me longer to shave with this I believe then the old way of doing things, but that may improve the more I use it.  And do as the manual suggests and give your face some time to adjust to the \\&quot;new\\&quot; method of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t needed to use the cleaning cartridge yet, but I imagine I will because I have hard water.  As of now, I just rinse it out under the tap.  I purchased this for using on vacation, but I think I&#x27;ll end up using this much more regularly and perhaps it will one day replace regular razors for me.</li>
    <li> way to much , doesn,t shave close at all.&lt;br /&gt;the clearner don,t even work good.&lt;br /&gt;not worth the money if you like a close shave&lt;br /&gt;had to go back to my mac 3 , wish i could have gotten my money back for this.</li>
    <li> Probably not worth what I paid for it.  You&#x27;re going to have to do alot of back and forth work to get a decent shave out of it. Don&#x27;t try and shave your neck or you&#x27;re gonna get some razor burn.  Actually shaves better dry than wet.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd blade so far and shaving quality is average to below average. I&#x27;ve owned about 6 electric shavers.  Best one I&#x27;ve had yet was a Remington I bought back in the 80&#x27;s.  Only problem is that I can&#x27;t find the replacement blades and screen for it anymore and when its&#x27; running it sounds like I triggered an alarm at a military base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side it looks futuristic.</li>
    <li> I have had Panasonic shavers for 20 years and this one for 6. Works as expected and nice close shave. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Panasonic ES8066 for 5 or 6 years now and totally love it.  It was time for a new screen and blades though, so I started shopping for them online.  Along came this deal.  It was about $20 more than the screen and blades would have been, but I thought, what the heck - self-cleaning, pivot design and 3,000 more RPMs than my current model - let&#x27;s give it a shot.  Man, am I glad that I did!!!  This sucker rocks.  My ES8066 would require multiple passes in those hard-to-reach areas (like between my jawbone and earlobe) and I would still find missed whiskers...  Not anymore.  This razor gets them all on the first pass.  Also, I tend to let my beard go from Thursday to Monday morning (and anytime I don&#x27;t otherwise \\&quot;have\\&quot; to shave) so it can get pretty unruly with extra long growth.  I used to dread the first pass with my ES8066 because, without fail, some of those hairs would get yanked instead of cut - OUCH!  I hated that aspect but felt it a small price to pay for such a clean, close shave.  Once again, that extra 3,000 RPM that this razor gives me over what my old one did has put an end to all of those \\&quot;OUCH\\&quot; moments.  I recently let my beard grow out even longer than normal over vacation and, much to my surprise, when it was time to mow it down, not a single whisker was pulled - just cut, smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.    I won&#x27;t be throwing out my ES8066 - it still runs like brand new.  Nope, I&#x27;ll be passing it along to my oldest son in a year or two (with a new screen and blades).  It&#x27;s too good a razor to throw away, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good as my new ES8078S!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased from Amazon at a good price and used for 4 months now. Razor works very well even better than my previous Braun especially on my neck. I used to have to touch-up with a straight blade but dont need to with the Panasonic. Charge lasts a very long time and cleaning is easy and thorough. I do find that the replacement cartridges are hard to find and often out-of-stock. It is best if you can purchase a year supply at one time. [...].</li>
    <li> I used to use a norelco lift and cut and was in search of a closer electric shave.  I had heard great things about this and thought i&#x27;d try it.  even with shaving cream my face is far more irritated than it was with the norelco.      The closeness of the shave on the cheek and sideburns area is great - better than the norelco.  However my neck and chin areas are red / nicked and it feels like I barely shaved.  I have found myself redoing my neck with my norleco a number of times.    Cleans easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month and I am fairly happy with it. I&#x27;ve owned 3 Panasonic shavers over the past 10 years and I find them to be the best for tough beards like mine. I&#x27;ve tried Braun, Remington, and Wahl and have never been happy with their performance. This shaver works great if you know how to get the most out of it. I&#x27;ve learned over the years that there are three things that are important to getting a good shave with an electric razor : 1. Keep the shaver clean. This is made very easy with this shaver since it has a combo charging / cleaning base. 2. Wash and dry your face BEFORE shaving. This will make your whiskers stand up and easier to cut.  3. Press LIGHTLY on your face with the shaver on the first pass. If you still have any stubborn whiskers, then press harder until you have a clean shave.  If you follow these steps, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be as happy with this shaver as I am.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I purchased this shaver new from Amazon and received an opened box with used shaver and missing water tank on the cleaning system.  Buyer beware on this one.    UPDATE: I contacted Amazon and received a new shaver with all the parts.  I like the shaver and use it for my beard and my bald head and it works great.  I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system and just use hand soap to clean the razor and wash under water.  It gives a nice close shave too.</li>
    <li> Being in the military, I have to shave daily and unfortunately that includes my face and my head. Over the past nine years of having to do so, i have tried several different types of electric razors and nothing ever came close to the shave of a regular razor (Mach 3, headblade, Fusion). After spending a ton of money on constantly replacing the blades for the Fusion and Mach 3, I decided to do some research and find the best electric razor and give it a shot. This razor is amazing for the head. I use it in the shower and use shower gel vice shaving cream and it works great, just as close as a normal razor. Only reason I gave it 4 stars vice 5 is that it does not catch all the hairs on my face and usually have to run it over my face multiple times.</li>
    <li> it gives me a closer shave than anything I&#x27;ve tried but a razor, but it isn&#x27;t as fast as a rotary style shaver, so I keep my old one around for times I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I have waited a long time to be able to get an electric razor that is really nice. I could not pass up such a great deal.    I decided to try the foil style razor and I was very unhappy with the results. It took for ever to get a portion of my face shaved. I had to go over and over the same areas and I still could not get a clean shave.    While I was shaving I noticed the hair that was removed mostly fell onto my clothes and the sink. This is not good when you are on the way to work.   I just wasn&#x27;t happy at all. My old razor worked better with 2yr old blades in a fraction of the time. I will be going back to the rotary style.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, and I&#x27;m very impressed!  I agree with the other reviews in that it works much better as a wet shaver than a dry shaver.  The charging/cleaning base is a little large, just be sure that you have enough room for it.&lt;br /&gt;The price at Amazon is the lowest I&#x27;ve found on the internet or in stores.</li>
    <li> My husband received it as a gift, at first he was skeptical (as always) but after using the product few times he loved it. He never wants to go back to the disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Seems to shave a little closer than my old Norelco, but it misses areas and I have to check closely.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between this model and the ES8077 (new model-year perhaps?) but they both appear to be exceptional razors.  I&#x27;ve had it for over two weeks and the battery isn&#x27;t even close to needing a re-charge.  I replaced an older Panasonic razor with this one and found it to provide a superior shave.  One of the great things about this razor is the ability to charge it in it&#x27;s cleaner/charger stand OR with the charger adapter alone.  This enables the razor to be used (and charged) practically anywhere in the world and you don&#x27;t have to drag the cleaner assembly around with it, just the razor and its relatively small plug-in adapter.  This was a big plus for me as I travel to Europe periodically.  Then again, given the battery life on this thing, it may not even be necessary to charge it while I&#x27;m in Europe!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s a wet/dry razor, it gives the user an option to clean the razor with soap and water without using the stand and buying cleaning cartridges--something Braun apparently doesn&#x27;t do and one of the major reasons I abandoned Braun back when they started selling razors that required cleaning cartridges.  The cleaning cartridges were a good idea for razor manufacturer profits, dumb idea for a consumer who just wants a razor that works without the monthly fee for cleaning cartridge refills.  Braun lost a customer because of that philosophy.  I simply don&#x27;t buy the idea that after decades of razor manufacturer they suddenly need regular special cleanings to work properly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really haven&#x27;t found any points of complaint regarding this razor.  The manual says your face may need up to 30 days to adjust but the 8078 caused no problems from day 1 (maybe because I was already using an older Panasonic?).  You have the option of using the included cleaner base if you want, but you at least have the option of alternate cleaning methods of you don&#x27;t want to spend that money every month.</li>
    <li> GOOD SHAVER IF YOU USE SHAVING GEL. DOES NOT WORK TOO WELL ON DRY SHAVING.TAKES ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS MANUAL RAZOR BUT IS MUCH SAFER. I USE IT TO SHAVE THE HAIR ON MY EAR AS WELL.WORKS GREAT THERE TOO.</li>
    <li> This unit is just OK. average shaving &amp; comfort.   If you want a unit that can be cleaned &amp; is water safe, it&#x27;s good.   Nothing to spectacular about the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> After just a couple of uses, I can tell my face is smoother than when I was using a blade. It feels nice and solid, is easy to set up.  I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in the shower!</li>
    <li> I usually only buy cheap shavers. This is my first more expensive shaver, and I loved it. Shaves smooth and well. I don&#x27;t have to run this shaver over  and over repeatedly nearly as much as i used to to get a clean shave. In fact, my wife tried this shaver to shave her leg once. And ever since she tried to steal it away from me whenever she can.</li>
    <li> The wet dry Vortex gives the closest shave of any electric razor I have used.  I like the wet shave of this razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and have been giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Understanding that no electric shaver can compete   with a blade razor I did adjust my expectations a bit.  However there are several disadvantages to this razor.    1)The charger/cleaner system is some what of a mess, it takes nearly three hours to clean the razor and the sound it makes doing these routines makes me think there is a buzz saw in the bathroom.  Clearly something you cannot do at night.    2) The adjustable head feature only has two settings and really does not   glide across your face as well as a triple head norelco.    3) I had an older Panasonic that I cold stand on end in my medicine cabinet to dry and save space.  This razor you cannot stand on end, a minor thing to think of however we all know how small a medicine cabinet is.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to add one thing not mentioned, for those who haven&#x27;t used a foil-type shaver. If you go for over 2-3 days without shaving, you&#x27;ll have to use the trimmer to cut the hair down to a stubble before using the shaver, unless you enjoy having your facial hair violently yanked out. This happens most often on your neck, due to the hair growth angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also have an older Panasonic foil shaver and it doesn&#x27;t do this.  Before getting the Hydraclean, I was using the Panasonic to cut the hair down to stubble, then finished with a rotary Norelco. I&#x27;d hoped this new one would allow me to get rid of those two old shavers, but for some reason, it pulls more than any razor I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the short life (4 weeks claimed, 6-8 in practice) of the cleaning cartridges is a downside. They may be relatively inexpensive, but monthly \\&quot;service charges\\&quot; to shave is an annoyance. It&#x27;s also a main reason why I stopped using razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, Panasonic is a high-quality, full-featured brand. The old Panasonic wet/dry I mentioned is going on 10 years old and still works great with the original foils and blades. Even the battery holds a charge for days on end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is definitely a cool gadget. Its ability to be used as a wet/dry shaver is a plus. It&#x27;s pricey, but well worth it if you want to buy a shaver and keep it for the next decade.</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shavers in the past 30 years, Norelco, Panasonic and Braun.  This is the best one that I have bought so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES8087S is the only one that easily shaves where my chin curves under.  I need only one pass.  Most shavers have taken several passes, including my most recent, the Norelco 360 model with the cleaner unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very quiet razor, unlike my last Panasonic model.  Almost as quiet as the Norelco.  It has never woken my wife when I leave the bathroom door open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use water to clean 6 days a week, running it under the faucet, and the cleaning unit once a week.  The cleaner workes well, has a drying cycle and a charging cycle, all can be individually accessed from the one select button on the unit, and it turns itself off when done.  The cleaner is also fairly quiet, but a bit more noisy than the shaver.  In light of the energy issues, I would recommend air drying rather than electric, but the unit has to be removed from the cleaner/charger to dry by asi.  The shaver fits in so snuggly that the following morning it is still damp (in humid Durham, NC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver only holds the charge for 7 or 8 days, but the power cord can be used separately from the cleaning / charging unit so taking it is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an excellent purchase and at the price, unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about a month now and so far it&#x27;s a top notch unit. I don&#x27;t have a real tough beard so I can&#x27;t say how well it would shave Fred Flintstone, but the average beard guy should be real happy. I just blow out the shavings for quick shaves and twice a week run it thru the clean cycle. This weekly practice for me works well and saves on cleaning solution. Also Lectric Shave preshave works great for me if you need a little extra lube and close shave.</li>
