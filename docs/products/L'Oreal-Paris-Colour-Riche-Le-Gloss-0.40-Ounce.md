      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The color is not what it looks like it will be - it&#x27;s a sheer plum color and is beautiful</li>
      <li>I do wish that the color was a bit darker, more pigmented, and more consistent with the color seen on the tube.</li>
      <li>OMG I love this lip gloss SOOOOO much!!</li>
      <li>Smells nice, very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>but it is light and shiny.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and lasts well.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be darker but it makes my lips bright and natural looking in a glossy way.</li>
      <li>The product is creamy and feel comfortable on the lips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 10 minutes of wear, I removed the product from my lips with a tissue and my lips were stained a nice pink color (I loved this feature!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i have tried out the L&#x27;Oreal paris lip color a few times now and it looks good on my fair skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a dark color , which is good.</li>
      <li>I used it on top of my pink lipstick and it turns off so good</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t look dark purple on your lips, which is a good thing in my opinion!</li>
      <li>and if you have cool skin tone.</li>
      <li>a good buy overall.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal is a great product - goes on smoothly - lasts through eating and drinking - reapplied after a few hours.</li>
      <li>Perfect lipgloss if you want subtle tint</li>
      <li>Smells like vanilla, but fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Live this kind of gloss, has my lips shiny and pretty</li>
      <li>This lip gloss is very pretty and gives a lighter wash of color over your lips.  </li>
      <li>No unpleasant tastes or smells, and no &amp;#34;candy-like&amp;#34; ones, either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Long lasting and perfect color.</li>
      <li>It looks super dark but in actuality it is a pleasant purple, sparklely color adding shine and moisture to your lips.</li>
      <li>so this is useful for those occasions.</li>
      <li>Ads just the right color to my lips.  </li>
      <li>The color is what I expected it to be, it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation; and while I do have to reapply it occasionally, I feel like I bought it for a great price.</li>
      <li>It is kind of heavy feeling, too, although not as sticky as some cheap lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>This plum color is perfect for my pale skin, blue eyes and brown hair.  </li>
      <li>So not the color pictured - was hoping for dark purple, but it&#x27;s more of a light purple.</li>
      <li>however I was pleasantly surprised that the gloss goes on smoothly and does not show up purple at all.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful deep pink shade.</li>
      <li>Would definitely purchase more in the future :)</li>
      <li>Other then that the shade is really nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not dark at all, and the &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; color is a nice, berry-ish red.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Frequent reapplication is required.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is clear so you can reach into a drawer and quickly grab the color you want.</li>
      <li>Another feature that I loved was the fact that is was long lasting.</li>
      <li>but it turned out I actually liked that it didn&#x27;t go on dark!  </li>
      <li>Yes, you have to reeapplied the product every 2 hrs but is to be expected with any lip gloss most of the time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very little, almost no color. It goes on almost as a clear gloss when it claims to be plum colored.</li>
    <li> THE COLOR WAS DARKER THAN EXPECTED, BUT I LIKE IT STILL &amp;#60;3  this review is based solely on my opinion after using the product</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed it left no purple tint at all to my lips. Just made them glitter a bit. But no so bad as a lip gloss goes..</li>
    <li> Kissable lips is every girls dream and I found mine. I have been wearing makeup since I was a teenager, but I have never really worn a lot of makeup. Mostly some base and eyeshadow and maybe a little eye liner, but never wore lipstick before.  this lipstick was offered to me at a discounted price to try in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  Do I ordered it. I tried it the first day I received it and loved it. It&#x27;s not a dark color , which is good. It gave my lips just enough color that they shined.  I know some lipsticks just feel heavy and sticky on your lips but this lipstick did not. I could not even tell I had anything on. Another feature that I loved was the fact that is was long lasting. I don&#x27;t have time to reapply lipstick several times a day and withe this is did not have to. The lipstick stayed on when I smoked and even when I ate and drank through the day. I would love to try other colors also. This lipstick had changed my opinion on wearing lipstick.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this. Not very much color payoff. not the best tasting. Doesn&#x27;t feel the greatest. Just not good.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Thought the plum color would be more noticeable. Otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was so cheap and was a little nervous I was buying purple lip gloss however I was pleasantly surprised that the gloss goes on smoothly and does not show up purple at all. Wish I would have bought more. Great gloss for the price and don&#x27;t be afraid of the purple it goes on clear with a slight purple hue.</li>
    <li> Love the way it Goes on and love the color of it</li>
    <li> It looks super dark but in actuality it is a pleasant purple, sparklely color adding shine and moisture to your lips.</li>
    <li> I like it and its long lasting but its definitely not plum once it comes out the tube... Its a clear purple doesn&#x27;t show color at all.</li>
    <li> No unpleasant tastes or smells, and no &amp;#34;candy-like&amp;#34; ones, either.&lt;br /&gt;It provides nice, transparent color &amp; a good shine. Quite sticky and doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Frequent reapplication is required.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is clear so you can reach into a drawer and quickly grab the color you want.</li>
    <li> I really do like to product. I like th color is a nice shad of plum which compliments my skin tone. Easy to apply. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be scared of the dark color! It is a beautiful deep pink shade.</li>
    <li> i have tried out the L&#x27;Oreal paris lip color a few times now and it looks good on my fair skin. I did have to apply it several times in a day due to eating and drinking but overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this gloss.  I thought it was going to be too dark for me, but it&#x27;s not at all.  It goes on smooth and lasts well.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. Was lighter in color than I expected but I loved it, it is so hydrating and soft and glossy on my lips.</li>
    <li> I thought Plum Rush would be a tad darker than it goes on my lips but it turned out I actually liked that it didn&#x27;t go on dark!  L&#x27;Oreal is a great product - goes on smoothly - lasts through eating and drinking - reapplied after a few hours. Smells great too! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a great gloss at a great price.  Smells nice, very inexpensive.  It is not heavily pigmented so it will not make your lips look violet.  If you want a lightly colored, high gloss product for a great price then this is it!</li>
    <li> It is beautiful color and goes on easily. The color is very nice.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition. Its not a color I generally wear however there are times where I need a color I dont generally use so this is useful for those occasions. I have fair skin so the color is a bit to dark for me however if I colored my hair differently this might go with it well. Its good to have on hand and the price couldnt be beat so a good buy overall.</li>
    <li> So not the color pictured - was hoping for dark purple, but it&#x27;s more of a light purple. Texture is okay, wears off easily and is kind of sticky.  Glad it was on sale, otherwise I would be upset about spending the money.</li>
    <li> I thought the color was going to be darker. Not too pleased with the color. It can get a little but messy.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Long lasting and perfect color.</li>
    <li> The color was not the same with this order, more red than the usual clear dark purple.</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss! It&#x27;s shiny and isn&#x27;t sticky. Although it&#x27;s dark purple in the tube, it goes on just slightly tinted...it doesn&#x27;t look dark purple on your lips, which is a good thing in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Color is deceptive from name to tube. Non sticky and moisturizing.  Sheer color. Shine but not wet look. Would buy again.  I purchased the &amp;#34;plum rush &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the smell, the way leaves your lips . Is perfect to use it every day.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product as ALL L&#x27;Oreal products!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be darker but it makes my lips bright and natural looking in a glossy way.</li>
    <li> Live this kind of gloss, has my lips shiny and pretty</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Leaves a cool toned purple pink tint, looks natural when used alone. Enhances the coolness of your current lip product if used over a lipstain or lipstick. Gloss is high quality. Don&#x27;t be scared off by the color, it&#x27;s completely transparent and only tints your lips. Like OCCs stained glass lip gloss. Except this is way easier to use any time, since you dont need to mess with a tiny lip brush. Smells like vanilla, but fades quickly. Perfect lipgloss if you want subtle tint and if you have cool skin tone.</li>
    <li> leaked all over package</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizing lip gloss that you can wear anytime. It&#x27;s got a little plum color but looks more red to me. I just apply it alone without other lipstick or stains.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone. They said it&#x27;s okay, but probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product looks very dark purple in the container, however when applied to the lips it was actually more of a medium-pink tone (as seen on my lips – no other makeup products were worn during this photo). When first applied, the product seemed a bit thick and slightly sticky, however after a few seconds the formula became smooth and felt very nice on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 minutes of wear, I removed the product from my lips with a tissue and my lips were stained a nice pink color (I loved this feature!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet worn this product for a prolonged period of time, however I don’t feel that it would be very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product was of good quality and seemed to moisturize my lips. I do wish that the color was a bit darker, more pigmented, and more consistent with the color seen on the tube. I found this to be very confusing. I also wish the formula was a bit thinner and easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Nice color - like most lipgloss, it doesn&#x27;t last long.  The color is not what it looks like it will be - it&#x27;s a sheer plum color and is beautiful</li>
    <li> This review is for color 163 Plum Rush.  It is really kind of terrible.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you are looking for deep purple color or any color, for that matter.  It really just looks like a clear shimmery clear gloss.  It is kind of heavy feeling, too, although not as sticky as some cheap lip glosses.  Didn&#x27;t cost much but it isn&#x27;t as expected so just a waste of a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I really like the formula of this lip gloss. Yes, you have to reeapplied the product every 2 hrs but is to be expected with any lip gloss most of the time. The product is creamy and feel comfortable on the lips.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again. The color was lighter than expected but still pretty. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister and she loved it! It went on smooth and the color was great for her!</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is very pretty and gives a lighter wash of color over your lips.  It does not dry out your lips and there is no weird smell to it.  Would definitely purchase more in the future :)</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss.  This plum color is perfect for my pale skin, blue eyes and brown hair.  The gloss leaves a little stain behind which is great so that when I forget to reapply there is still some color there!</li>
    <li> The color is what I expected it to be, it&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation; and while I do have to reapply it occasionally, I feel like I bought it for a great price. All in all, a great purchase that I am happy with.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on sale. I thought the color might be too dark for me. It wasn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t go on as dark as it shows in the tube. It is a little thick for my taste, making applying a little difficult. Hence the reason for only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I love the way it covers my lips and the color. And it doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either..... I ordered the subscribe and save. Will be using this as a staple in my make up draw.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I bought it for a great price.</li>
    <li> I was hesitate to buy this color but after I received it and applied on my lip I just love it! Color isn&#x27;t too dark as I thought but it is light and shiny. It kept my lip from drying too. I used it on top of my pink lipstick and it turns off so good</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my lips and I love the scent/flavor. Has a nice tint to it</li>
    <li> I really liked the color of this it&#x27;s not as dark as it looks . It is very thick and goopy feeling though and if you put your lips together a lot it slides over your lip line . Also stains badly . Other then that the shade is really nice</li>
    <li> Very nice non sticky gloss, but it&#x27;s a light pink when it looks like a dark purple in the packaging?</li>
    <li> I like it better than I thought I would. The color is much lighter than I expected based on the picture of the tube and based on the color of the tube when I received it. It is really flattering.</li>
    <li> This is a great plum color and though its a little sheerer than i thought, its perfect a tone for those with brown or olive complexion. Give a nice shiny gloss without washing out your complexion</li>
    <li> OMG I love this lip gloss SOOOOO much!! It goes on with a light, transluscent color, but it also acts like a lip stain so the color remains for a long time. It&#x27;s not dark at all, and the &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; color is a nice, berry-ish red. This is one of my favorite lip glosses, hand down!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Goes on very smooth. I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. Wow- this is so hydrating and soft and glossy on my lips. great color for summer. Have already had several compliments while wearing this. Thank You</li>
    <li> Pretty color, but it doesn&#x27;t have great staying power. I had to reapply quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Ads just the right color to my lips.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out at the rainbow party this weekend.</li>
    <li> great product, love the color</li>
