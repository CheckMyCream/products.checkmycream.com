      <li>The curls in the black complimented my face perfectly but due to the color of this wig the curls wasnt working for me.</li>
      <li>It arrives pretty fast.</li>
      <li>- you must cut it first to blend with your hairline, but it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The hair looked more Orange than anything else with not a single black in it.</li>
      <li>, I Wish I Knew How To Upload A Pic , But The Only Thing Is , It Do Tangle Fast ,</li>
      <li>So soft and natural looking.</li>

<li> very dried out curls fall in two days does not take heat very well</li>
<li> i cant revive it...looks very dry all over and matted in the back.</li>

<li> The company took way to long to ship the product</li>
<li> But the hair has a long part.</li>
<li> then I tried red black.</li>
<li> The only bad thing is that it only lasts for about 2 weeks but considered its length and the fact that is synthetic that &amp;#34;life span&amp;#34; is about right.</li>
<li> Will be ordering this wig in other colors!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
<li> A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !</li>
<li> Being that I have Prime and didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping, I decided to get it even though I&#x27;ve seen it for $10-$20 less elsewhere.</li>
<li> I bought this wig in black</li>
<li> After 2 weeks, it was a matted, tangled mess that shed gobs of hair each time I tried to brush it out.</li>
<li> wore this as a everyday wig, but I dont think that is what it is intended for.</li>
<li> but I can tell you its hard for the curls to leave this wig.</li>
<li> I dont know if my iron is just too weak or its just this wig</li>
<li> I feel like they sent me the wrong wig or they are displaying fake adds.</li>

    <li> The wig was beautiful when i first bought it. I was in owe because the deep part and hair texture made it look so natural. I thought i found the holy grail of synthethic wigs however after wearing one night and sweating in the club it looked like id had it for months....i cant revive it...looks very dry all over and matted in the back. So three days i got out of it and now im trying to figure what to do with my hair:-((</li>

    <li> bangs are a bit long great wig</li>
    <li> Love the style but it tangles easily</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m buying another one! ..people think this is a sew in!!! Beautiful color 99j</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast. I placed my order and got it two days later:))) looks exactly like the picture, very long pretty and curly</li>
    <li> I liked it for the few days I could wear it. You can not curl this unit. Once the curls go..its done. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this wig twice and really like it! The only bad thing is that it only lasts for about 2 weeks but considered its length and the fact that is synthetic that &amp;#34;life span&amp;#34; is about right.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! nice texture, the cut is cute.I&#x27;m super excited to start wearing it</li>
    <li> This was pretty out of the box. But as soon as I put it on, it begin to shed. So here&#x27;s my pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Very Thick&lt;br /&gt;  Curls held well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Sheds a whole lot&lt;br /&gt;  Matts after the first wash&lt;br /&gt;  Tangles up constantly&lt;br /&gt;  The lace is very itchy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this as a everyday wig, but I dont think that is what it is intended for. After 2 weeks, it was a matted, tangled mess that shed gobs of hair each time I tried to brush it out. Overall it was a pretty wig, but definitely for a 1 or 2 time use.</li>
    <li> Really nice lace front. Wore it maybe a week.  Tangles really badly. Kind of a waste of money...</li>
    <li> This wig has many pluses, and only one con (in my opinion). Overall I highly recommend it, and will be buying it again in different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with wig combs attached right out of the box (definitely a plus to keeping it on all night)&lt;br /&gt;- High quality fibers - heat resistant and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;- Enough volume to be solid (not patchy or anything)&lt;br /&gt;- Lace cap - you must cut it first to blend with your hairline, but it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not as voluminous as the photo suggests - it&#x27;s definitely thinner than that, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> OMG I am so in love with this wig. All day people have been asking where I got my hair done.  Ordering 100 more....lol I&#x27;m feeling myself ( In Beyonce voice)</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my wedding. It was exactly like the picture. Maybe even better. I would buy another without question.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig; looks like a good weave.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, love, love. The quality? I cannot. Amazing. The density? Yaaassssss! I cut mine because I like hair that&#x27;s about 14-16 inches. Like for people to think it&#x27;s my hair or a really good sew-in. Hahaha. I ordered it on Amazon because it was sold out everywhere else. Being that I have Prime and didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping, I decided to get it even though I&#x27;ve seen it for $10-$20 less elsewhere. I wanted it that bad, and honestly...it&#x27;s well worth the money. FAST SHIPPING. Excited that I got it right away and even though I really wanted the 1B...the 1 still looks natural and like human hair. Smh. I see why it&#x27;s sold out everywhere. Four stars because I wanted it to be cheaper! Lol. But the hair has a long part. I won&#x27;t buy a wig without several inches of parting space. Nope. This company and Janet Collection Invisible and Deep Parts are my favorite. Great buy. Great service.</li>
    <li> I love this unit! This is my first lace front wig and it was amazing. Looks great and feels even better</li>
    <li> Just for a fast hair do</li>
    <li> I love love love this wig! You can&#x27;t even tell its a wig. You would think it was a full sew-in. I am definitely going to buy again and again. I have found my go to wig!!!</li>
    <li> Very very horrible wig do not buy it was tangled up in a week gets very dried out curls fall in two days does not take heat very well</li>
    <li> This hair tangles easy..</li>
    <li> Wig is wonderful. The company took way to long to ship the product</li>
    <li> Very easy, hassle free and this lace front looks great on me</li>
    <li> I bought this wig in black it was perfect then I tried red black. The hair looked more Orange than anything else with not a single black in it. I feel like they sent me the wrong wig or they are displaying fake adds. I decided to give this wig a shot. After I cut off the lace leaving a bit to the front.  I put in on. It was way more realistic looking than my usual black. The curls in the black complimented my face perfectly but due to the color of this wig the curls wasnt working for me. I decided to straighten it a bit out. I dont know if my iron is just too weak or its just this wig but I can tell you its hard for the curls to leave this wig. So wen I finished &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34;  I ended up with nice waves which I like a lot. The hair remained soft and beautiful. It doesnt shead a lot. Most synthetic hair has a plastic smell this one doesn&#x27;t. But still I spray a bit of oil on it. Over all am very satisfied with this unit and I even like the color</li>
    <li> Love!!!.This is my second time purchasing this unit. It arrives pretty fast. It has a short life span, but can be brought back to life with a flat iron if you don&#x27;t let it get too tangled underneath. Lots of compliments too!&lt;br /&gt;~One Happy Customer~</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig, natural deep part.  Quick shipping, arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! Its very pretty...but it  will tangle!</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig and more in the color OH227144.</li>
