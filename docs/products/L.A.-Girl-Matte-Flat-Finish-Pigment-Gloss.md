      <li>It was good</li>
      <li>I thought it would be more of a beige lol.</li>
      <li>I love these liquid lipsticks!</li>
      <li>It was fast shipping too!!!!!</li>
      <li>But like I said before colors look nice</li>
      <li>Just received one and the color was okay</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have gotten many complements on this lip gloss when I wore it wine tasting.</li>
      <li>The stickiness doesn&#x27;t go away unless you apply a translucent powder on top, witch I do in order to use this.</li>
      <li>but I love the color</li>
      <li>I am getting more colors from this line.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery thank you!!</li>
      <li>It works great for innexpensive alternative -oppose to buying one with other brands easily  costing you more than $17</li>
      <li>Overall opinion is ,  I would  say it was a great purchase for the price, you cant beat that  as it does delivers results you would expect and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice BUT much lighter than I thought it would be based on YouTube videos.</li>
      <li>But overall for the price, you get great quality lip color.</li>
      <li>It goes on SUPER pigmented and dries very quickly - so</li>
      <li>Super comparable to liquid matte colors that are $20.</li>
      <li>Also, if wearing for longerperiod of time under sun, especially  on a very hot day.</li>
      <li>You can however observe the (previously nonexistent) microscopic grand canyons  that this lipstick magically conjures across my lips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking shopping around for different liquid matte lipsticks and was excited to find one so cheap.</li>
      <li>I just have to line my lips with a brown liner first.</li>
      <li>It is as pretty as it looks.  </li>
      <li>exactly what i was expecting</li>
      <li>Lasts pretty much all day without touchups, might need to re-apply once in the afternoon.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented.</li>
      <li>work fast.</li>
      <li>Love the shade even though I thought it was a tad darker than expected.</li>
      <li>I thought the whole set was included....</li>
      <li>Also (this is to be expected with most liquid lipsticks or any drying lip color)</li>
      <li>And shipping was really fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much pinker...</li>
      <li>The color applies smooth and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>but for now I&#x27;m just going to put that $5 towards a more expensive brand with a better formula.</li>
      <li>I though the colors look nice, but it takes really long to dry and</li>
      <li>It happens  even with the high ends and drugstore brands like the rimmel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>3 stars cause what you expect pot the price, it shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise they are not even close to high end ones.</li>
      <li>It is a lot lighter, I just assumed  it would be a little  more darker than it was so suppose to be.</li>
      <li>This may look perfectly fine with dark colors, but in a nude it just looks like I have horrifically chapped and cracked lips.</li>
      <li>and it arrived a day early!</li>
      <li>my  downfall to this is that when you are drinking liquids it rubs off from the center of lips quickly.</li>
      <li>The color is much lighter than shown in the photo and is very similar to my natural lip color</li>
      <li>For me it turned a little more pink than when I initially put it on.</li>
      <li>Normally, my lip color diesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this because I have kept seeing  how everyone  is raving over this lip matte cream. When I received  the product, I tried  it immediately.  However , the cream looks nothing like the picture  displayed  on color list. It is a lot lighter, I just assumed  it would be a little  more darker than it was so suppose to be. Once the product has been applied  on the lips it immediately started  the proprocess of drying up,  and getting the set colo. You probably  need to apply least 2- 3 coates or whatever  is your preference.  You can see results  somewhat quickly  less than 15 mins to dry up. It works great for innexpensive alternative -oppose to buying one with other brands easily  costing you more than $17 +  such the Anastasia , Dose of color etc...my  downfall to this is that when you are drinking liquids it rubs off from the center of lips quickly. Also, if wearing for longerperiod of time under sun, especially  on a very hot day. I noticed  it started  to peel from lips...It is not a pretty  look eighter. I assume all matte creams do this, especially  if you are over applying ,continually doing so. It happens  even with the high ends and drugstore brands like the rimmel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Overall opinion is ,  I would  say it was a great purchase for the price, you cant beat that  as it does delivers results you would expect and somewhat similarities  to jefreestars, dose of colors, Anastasia  etc...It works. The 4 stars is because  of the color.</li>
    <li> I though the colors look nice, but it takes really long to dry and when it does it feels sticky. The stickiness doesn&#x27;t go away unless you apply a translucent powder on top, witch I do in order to use this. I got 3 colors but this one specifically peels easier that the others I got. 3 stars cause what you expect pot the price, it shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise they are not even close to high end ones. But like I said before colors look nice</li>
    <li> I reaaly do like it. Just like the others wrote, the color is not what I expected based on the picture they advertise. It&#x27;s much pinker...I thought it would be more of a beige lol. It works, though. I just have to line my lips with a brown liner first. The plain pink isn&#x27;t really suited for my complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking shopping around for different liquid matte lipsticks and was excited to find one so cheap. I got the color Dreamy and was unfortunately a bit let down. The color is much lighter than shown in the photo and is very similar to my natural lip color so you can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing anything by the color. You can however observe the (previously nonexistent) microscopic grand canyons  that this lipstick magically conjures across my lips. It seriously settles into every little fine line and turns it into a giant, obvious crack. This may look perfectly fine with dark colors, but in a nude it just looks like I have horrifically chapped and cracked lips. Perhaps I&#x27;ll try one of the darker colors eventually but for now I&#x27;m just going to put that $5 towards a more expensive brand with a better formula. Remember ladies, always google check your lipstick color before you buy online, it may save you some money and disappointment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice BUT much lighter than I thought it would be based on YouTube videos.</li>
    <li> A little sticky if you put a lot on so put only a thin layer and it will look great. Lasts pretty much all day without touchups, might need to re-apply once in the afternoon. Love the shade even though I thought it was a tad darker than expected. I have gotten many complements on this lip gloss when I wore it wine tasting. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Has a medical feel to your lips all day. It&#x27;s weird but I love the color and it is definitely matte</li>
    <li> It was good but it can peel and look a little odd after going through your day. It does look best with lip liner so I recommend trying that. I am going to try their other colors!</li>
    <li> Its sooo matte like ILOVEEEE IT !</li>
    <li> Love the color!!! Very fast delivery thank you!! ☺</li>
    <li> I love these liquid lipsticks! Very pigmented. And shipping was really fast I got it in two days</li>
    <li> Love it. It was fast shipping too!!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought the whole set was included.... Just received one and the color was okay it just feels ver sticky</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It goes on SUPER pigmented and dries very quickly - so work fast. It stays put and doesn&#x27;t bleed out or anything. And it&#x27;s a great neutral color on fair toned skin. Probably my only complaint about it is that it can tend to oxidize over the period of a few hours and can change tone. For me it turned a little more pink than when I initially put it on. Also (this is to be expected with most liquid lipsticks or any drying lip color) it can be a bit sticky. But overall for the price, you get great quality lip color. Super comparable to liquid matte colors that are $20. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> I got this color because I saw it on the Carli Bybel video.  It is as pretty as it looks.  The color applies smooth and lasts a long time.  Normally, my lip color diesn&#x27;t last long.  This one does!  I am getting more colors from this line.</li>
    <li> Not the color I thought it was and it was not the formula as promised</li>
    <li> Love it , it&#x27;s awesome &amp; lasts on for quite a while .</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected it to be,  I applied it and it made my lips look ashy and chapped</li>
    <li> exactly what i was expecting and it arrived a day early!</li>
