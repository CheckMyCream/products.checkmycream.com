      <li>I just cannot say enough about these wonderful products</li>

      <li>Love the product and the price at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that I love Dermalogica and their products, including this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love this line</li>
      <li>I really was quite happy with this distributer.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite moisturizer ( and I&#x27;m a skincare coinsure).</li>
      <li>I hope the product is doing more than shield the sun for the price.  </li>
      <li>Love that this has the 30spf in it</li>
      <li>I have an oily skin, and I always look for things that won&#x27;t make my oily skin more oily - which SPF lotions tend to do.  </li>
      <li>I love it and Amazon has the lowest prices.  </li>
      <li>Great Product- Fast Shipment</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly on my skin &amp; gets absorbed pretty well &amp; provides an excellent moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Very light and absorbs quickly buy it!</li>
      <li>It has a very mild fragrance which I love.  </li>
      <li>Been using dermatolica for about a year now, i really enjoy what products i have been able to try, planning on trying out more.</li>
      <li>so I need something to keep my skin from becoming damaged from the sun.</li>
      <li>This product is my favourite of all the Dermalogica products I have tried and great for aging mature skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a great sunscreen for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite moisturizer since I purchased originally from ULTA.</li>
      <li>The smell of the product is a clean, refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>Very quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>- i use them all, but you don&#x27;t have to use them all to see amazing results within the first 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>I also love that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and no sunscreen smell.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and worth the $$.  </li>
      <li>It continues to be such a great illuminator and sun protector.</li>
      <li>Not only is this a great face cream</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not sticky and goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>This goes on smooth...</li>
      <li>Dermalogica products are fragrance free but not odorless.  </li>
      <li>Wash my face, smooth it on</li>
      <li>Light but softens skin.</li>
      <li>This light weight moisturizer has been a staple for me all summer.  </li>
      <li>Great for daily use morning and night.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get any breakouts from it and seems to do a good job as far as moisturizing and protecting my skin.</li>
      <li>The entire age-smart line from Dermalogica is the absolute best!  </li>
      <li>Regardless, overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this lotion.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by a skin doctor and it really made my skin look and feel better.</li>
      <li>I am in my mid 40th and have always had good skin.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, there was some stinging the first time I put this on.</li>
      <li>but don&#x27;t like paying full price for products without trying them first.  </li>
      <li>and you get travel size this, cleanser, toner, eye treatment, and something extra( which is extremely nice to have in your purse).</li>
      <li>Everything I have used in the Dermalogica line has been outstanding, doing as much, actually more than what I expected.</li>
      <li>Great daily moisturizer that keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
      <li>and she is so right.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, this review is real and I urge you NOT to try Dermalogica LAST, like I did!</li>
      <li>Product was a little greasy and smelled not so good.  </li>
      <li>It would be ideal to have a sun screen for the day and the regular Active Moist for bed time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>I really love this product, especially the fact that it has SPF 30.  </li>
      <li>I would purchase the large sun screen next time as the hydramist contains much more.</li>
      <li>since i have been using this whole line, ive had compliments from many how much younger</li>
      <li>It keeps skin moist all day and night without leaving a greasy residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great when used with the Age Smart Antioxidant Hydramist.</li>
      <li>It is the ONLY moisturizer that I have ever used that truly vanishes and allows foundation to be applied smoothly over it.</li>
      <li>Always have used Intense Moisture Balance, but needed something for aging.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dermalogica is a great product!  I still use this as my back up sunscreen under my makeup even though I now use what my esthetician recommends.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, there was some stinging the first time I put this on. Was afraid it wasn&#x27;t for me. however after reading the ingredients and realizing what was in it I am okay with the small amount of sting. My skin has since become accustomed to the product and it is working great. Love the spf 30. Another wonderful product. Has helped to improve the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I went to a spa, and dermalogica was recommended.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the products at home, when I made my purchase I thought it would takes days to arrive, but it took a short time.  I&#x27;ve already started use of the product.  Yes, I&#x27;d order from this seller, again.</li>
    <li> Light but softens skin. Does not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> Great Product- Fast Shipment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 18 days.  My skin started looking much softer and younger looking from the start. My cheeks have also puffed up.  I never use anything on my face other than olive oil or coconut oil because everything stings my eyes really bad when I sweat on my walks or doing gardening. This product does not cause any eye stinging. I&#x27;ve been using the samples which have lasted me 9 days per packet. That is how little you need. A little goes a long way. I use Ponds moisturizer at night and in the morning I just apply a little Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery</li>
    <li> It is a good product.  I really like using it.  It is a good moisturizer and gives good sun protection too!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer for my aging skin-absorbs easily-love it!</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product was a little greasy and smelled not so good.  Also, the \\&quot;fumes\\&quot; kind of sting your eyes a bit.  Got a zit the next day after using and I have very dry skin.  Product did arrive on time, but I was not happy it did not have a seal on it.</li>
    <li> I use this daily before makeup.  It goes on smooth and no sunscreen smell.  Plus its moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve been using for over a year.</li>
    <li> A terrific moisturizer for everyday use.  I have used this for years and keep going back to it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I lover Dermalogica products, but this one was just okay.  It didn&#x27;t provide anything extra special.  And for the price tag I expect something more.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the morning, mixed with a serum. It smells good, feel wonderful - not too rich, but the skin feels moisturized - and I like the SPF 30 aspect.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I love Dermalogica and their products, including this. But I am not a big fan of things with high SPF value, so I ordered this SPECIFICALLY because it was the SPF 30, or at least thats what the product image and description claimed. When it arrived I got the SPF 50, which I could have just bought at my local ULTA or beauty supply store. I dont like the misleading advertisement, but I guess Ill deal with it since returning things is not really my deal</li>
    <li> Been using dermatolica for about a year now, i really enjoy what products i have been able to try, planning on trying out more.</li>
    <li> I need a moisturizer with built in sunscreen, but I hate the sunscreen smell in other moisturizers.  This one has no odor at all.  My skin is moisturized and feels great.  I have been using this product for several years now.  It is my go-to.</li>
    <li> Works great for the face and neck after cleansing and toning -Good  moisturizer and spf sun block.  I recommend it completely,</li>
    <li> Love it....leaves skin even and non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for a while now and can clearly see the difference&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps for dry skin can be too dry&lt;br /&gt;Build in SPF 30</li>
    <li> Love Dermalogica products but don&#x27;t like paying full price for products without trying them first.  Always have used Intense Moisture Balance, but needed something for aging.  Very quick delivery.  Will recommend supplier &amp; purchase from again!</li>
    <li> This light weight moisturizer has been a staple for me all summer.  It has SPF 30.  I wore it everyday all summer and it did not feel heavy even in the hottest and most humid days.</li>
    <li> Everything I have used in the Dermalogica line has been outstanding, doing as much, actually more than what I expected. A great product for me with results that are really great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I really was quite happy with this distributer. Pkg.and price were great and will use again.I found the value well worth the short time I waited for product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years exclusively.  It continues to be such a great illuminator and sun protector. Makes skin glow. Love Dermalogica!</li>
    <li> that I have ever used!  I love it and Amazon has the lowest prices.  This product is my favourite of all the Dermalogica products I have tried and great for aging mature skin.  It moisturizes and penetrates leaving your skin hydrated.  it has a bit of a medicinal smell but I like it.  The smell is not offensive.  It is without doubt the best moisturizer I have used.  When I have run out and have to use other products lying around the house feel the difference.  Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. It improves skin.</li>
    <li> Dermalogica hardly ever disappoints me.  I really like this moisturizer it isn&#x27;t overly moisturizing to the point of making my skin greasy feeling.  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it.. which is personal preference, it&#x27;s light smelling but just not appealing to me.  Love that this has the 30spf in it so you know your face is always protected from the UV&#x27;s just from moisturizing.  I am trying a different moisturizer this time but if I don&#x27;t like this next one I will definitely be repurchasing this one again.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a great face cream but I don&#x27;t have to put on any added sunscreen.  Wash my face, smooth it on and I am ready for the day even if I am going to be in the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this since 2004.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I have used the Dermalogica Dynamic skin Recovery SPF 30 for 2 years now. It was first given to me by my Esthetician after a facial.  My skin is in excellent condition for my age (55) and my Esthetician said to keep it looking good  and to help prevent any problems that this is a good product and she is so right.  I love the 30 spf because anything more than that is unnecessary.  The smell of the product is a clean, refreshing scent.  I&#x27;m constantly being complimented on y skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ...great&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
    <li> Best value for the cost of this product.</li>
    <li> The entire age-smart line from Dermalogica is the absolute best!  I am 64 years old and, before i started using Dermalogica, it looked 80.  I have serious sun damage and dark spots that will not fade for any other high-end product.  After only one (1) month, my skin is completely repaired, new, and now looks 35!  I have never experiences anything that works this well and in retrospect, I am sorry that I spent so much money on slightly less costly products that did zero to repair my skin.  Not only my dark spots, but all of the wrinkles around my eyes, mouth and on each side of my chin.  Did I mention the forehead worry lines?  Yep, those are gone too.  I just cannot say enough about these wonderful products - i use them all, but you don&#x27;t have to use them all to see amazing results within the first 24 hours.  Honestly, this review is real and I urge you NOT to try Dermalogica LAST, like I did!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.  Even my husband notices the moisturizing effect.  It&#x27;s an effective sunscreen.  We use it daily in the desert.</li>
    <li> Tis is my favorite Derma product and I use a lot of them! This goes on smooth...it is not too heavy. Most importantly it does not break me out! I love it and will use it forever!</li>
    <li> Best sun block. Just too costly for me.</li>
    <li> Bottled arrived without the usual Dermologica box. And stamped-on ID number on bottom, above expiration date was smeared and illegible; looked intentional. There was a paper seal, but don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s authentic. Usually these seals are plastic? Looked very sketchy to me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Makes my face feel wonderful</li>
    <li> This product works well but is a tad bit oily for me.</li>
    <li> since i have been using this whole line, ive had compliments from many how much younger i look&lt;br /&gt;i love this line</li>
    <li> Very happy with this order as it was on time.</li>
    <li> a good moisturiser for aging skin but must be used in conjunction with night cream etc to keep skin moisturised sufficiently</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 years and absolutely happy with it.  I have seen results in the texture of my skin and intend to continue using for a long time.  Another great product from Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> I have oily-from-within but surface-dry skin.  This product, worn under makeup, is a wonderful moisturizer, firmer and toner with no trace of grease or shine.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite moisturizer ( and I&#x27;m a skincare coinsure). It leaves my skin moist, supple, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. I have been using this stuff for years and if you have aging skin that is oily, dry, and sensitive you should defiantly try this product. And if your afraid to spend so much then you can buy the starter pack which is around $45 and you get travel size this, cleanser, toner, eye treatment, and something extra( which is extremely nice to have in your purse).</li>
    <li> Great daily moisturizer that keeps my skin soft all day. Works well for my sensitive skin and protects it with SPF. Great for daily use morning and night.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, especially the fact that it has SPF 30.  I&#x27;m really bad about putting on sun screen so with this, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t see how much lotion you have left in the bottle until you don&#x27;t have any. :)</li>
    <li> I can definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve been using Dynamic Skin Recovery for quite awhile and I love it because it always makes my skin look and feel great. I spend a lot of time outdoors so I need something to keep my skin from becoming damaged from the sun. Its not greasy and it never leaves my skin feeling oily. Its a little bit pricey but a little goes a long way and so the bottle lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer / sunscreen is amazing. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft. Perfect under my foundation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had red cheeks and a blotchy complexion but this product took it all away! I vave been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> great light and has spf. no break out either!! love it. I wish I could carry these products in my hair salon!! Love all the products!! try them you won&#x27;t be dis appointed. jill tatlor</li>
    <li> Dermalogica products are fragrance free but not odorless.  This definitely has an odor of what I believe to be sunscreen.  I hope the product is doing more than shield the sun for the price.  I could have bought sunscreen at a low price.  I generally use the Age Smart Super Repair moisturizer but want something lighter.  I simply do not like the sunscreen (assumption) smell and wish I had stuck with what worked.  The canister is a lot smaller than I imagined as well.  Would not recommend and of course will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Using this daily has kept me out of the dermatologist&#x27;s.  I have rosacea and this helps keep it under control.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  It is the ONLY moisturizer that I have ever used that truly vanishes and allows foundation to be applied smoothly over it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica products for a while now, and this did not disappoint me either.  I have an oily skin, and I always look for things that won&#x27;t make my oily skin more oily - which SPF lotions tend to do.  I mix this with Dermalogica Extreme C.  It goes on smoothly on my skin &amp; gets absorbed pretty well &amp; provides an excellent moisturizing.  I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging property - I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve been noticing that my skin is losing elasticity, and I doubt that this lotion alone can improve the skin elasticity.  Regardless, overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Dermalogica products on amazon in the past and at least one time received a product that was not likely the real product.  This is.  Love it and saved a little $ by purchasing through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a non-greasy sun screen and moisturizer in one. I haven&#x27;t so far had any problems with it getting in my eyes when I sweat but then I don&#x27;t sweat very often. It would be ideal to have a sun screen for the day and the regular Active Moist for bed time but I get by with just the day time sunblock and moisturizer. It keeps skin moist all day and night without leaving a greasy residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great when used with the Age Smart Antioxidant Hydramist. I would purchase the large sun screen next time as the hydramist contains much more.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen for those with sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t sting or cause my skin to become flushed. I also love that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. My only complaint is the pump mechanism. It can&#x27;t be removed. So, you can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re about to run out!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite moisturizer since I purchased originally from ULTA. I don&#x27;t get any breakouts from it and seems to do a good job as far as moisturizing and protecting my skin.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 40th and have always had good skin.  I was recommended this product by a friend and decided to give it a try.  Although it has SPF30 but it&#x27;s not sticky and goes on smoothly and it also has Vita C in it.  It has a very mild fragrance which I love.  The sunscreen &amp; vita c combination is great as it gives sun protection in the meantime exfoliate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my new routine of using Dermalogica Skin Hydrating Booster, then Dynamic Skin Recovery, finish with ColoreScience SPF powder during the day, then in the evening with the Dermalogica Skin Hydrating Booster, La Mer classic cream, I can &amp; feel my skin is really soft and smooth.  There is definitely some improvement compared to my old routine.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> highly recommend this product, wouldnt use anything other product now with an SPF 30.  Very light and absorbs quickly buy it!</li>
    <li> Love this product and worth the $$.  I&#x27;d recommend this to all Dermalogica users!  You save quite a lot from the local dealerships.</li>
    <li> I IITHOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE CREAMY  AND I COULD USE IT UNDER MAKEPUPII WILL ORDER  ANOTHER PRODUCT AFTER I WASH MY FACE IT SEEMS LIKE IT STINGS A  LITTLE</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a skin doctor and it really made my skin look and feel better. I highly recommend it to people who want to defy the signs of ageing. A bit pricey but it goes a long way and definitely does wonders to your skin.</li>
