### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>So I decided to try Neutrogena since I have always found the products they sell to be very good.  </li>
      <li>good price for this, and this doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout!</li>
      <li>Great lotion.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for 3 months now, and it&#x27;s been working great.</li>
      <li>Good price and quality</li>
      <li>I think the Neutrogena will be great for warmer months when skin tends to be more hydrated.  </li>
      <li>Have used for years; the best for all skin types because it does not irritate and is easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>and I never had so many pimples on my face at one time, ever in my life!</li>
      <li>This stuff is the best I have used so far.</li>
      <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I also love the pump on this product.</li>
      <li>To use at this point you have to remove the top and use the straw tube to fish out lotion.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve found a keeper :)</li>
      <li>I love this because it is water-based, oil free and very very light.</li>
      <li>However, if you tend to have very VERY dry face, maybe this moisturizer is not the best for you.</li>
      <li>Good value and doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne ridden skin with the use of retin a as much as others with sunscreens, etc</li>
      <li>Best thing about these underwear is the bamboo fiber they are made of, which seems to be stronger than cotton, is more stretchy and less bulky.</li>
      <li>I have skin that gets hives and bumps easily.</li>
      <li>I break out easily and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for my skin.</li>
      <li>The lotion is fine...</li>
      <li>This product does a fine job reducing the redness and dryness.</li>
      <li>But overall I am happy with the product and the effects of the moisturizer on my skin</li>
      <li>Great facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with this moisturizer, and it works great after getting out of the shower, or after washing my face after a long day out.     </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
      <li>product soothes and moisturizes, absorbs quickly into my skin and is non-oily so it doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>As I get older my needs for magic increase.  </li>
      <li>It light and non-greasy (for real)</li>
      <li>It made my face feels very hydrated and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the cost to me.</li>
      <li>I used to use Oil of Olay Senstive skin, but it harder to find and not quite as good.  </li>
      <li>It is very good for sensitive skin as it does not burn dry/cracked skin like other lotions often do.</li>
      <li>Workmanship is very good, front pouch is rather small,  waistbands are like those found on high end products.</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and would definitely recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it gets rid of dry, red skin, and I even use it sometimes on my arms, or neck.</li>
      <li>I have used this moisturizer for many years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that does not irritate my super sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>African-American and have been using this product for 6 months and decided to repurchase from Amazon since it saves time and comes in pretty much 2 days (Prime).</li>
      <li>Prefer these because there&#x27;s no perfume, purely functional lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easy and does not require much to spread over your entire face.</li>
      <li>Underwear are of very high quality and are very affordable.</li>
      <li>It hydrates but feels light and not at all oily or gross.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years, primarily after a shower, or washing my face.</li>
      <li>however I have noticed that when I use a little more than a drop on certain areas of my face</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to all.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin which even reacts to some products that are supposed to be &#x27;anti-allergenic&#x27; and &#x27;non-comedogenic&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Used it last night for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Many lotions have this same problem, however, and overall it&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a moisturizer to serve as an after-shave after shaving with an electric razor, which always makes my face feel somewhat parched and sensitive.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick or oily feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle after 3 months, but I highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>So I mix this in with Black Opal Invisible Oil absorbing powder and pat it over my face &#x3D;</li>
      <li>After you put this on and let it dry, it feels like nothing&#x27;s there, but your skin is left feeling soft and moisturized.     </li>

<li> Size seems to run a little bit smaller than average.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive -</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a guy, but this cold weather gives me wicked dry skin, especially when I shave and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
<li> I have dark skin</li>
<li> Why buy a $50 little container of moisturizer from a beauty store when this works just as well?</li>
<li> This leaves my face feeling silky and hydrated and not greasy and heavy</li>
<li> So, I have to stay away from the heavy moisturizes; lest I look like I&#x27;ve been afflicted with the pox.  </li>
<li> After a few misses I hit upon this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I have been using this product for the past 10 years</li>
<li> per-bottle price looks steep, but I usually get two or three months out of one.</li>
<li> and I do not have a complaint.</li>
<li> I am finding that I rely on the oil based Clinique when the weather is cold and dry.</li>
<li> what is  not good at all is the fact about 1/2 thru the bottle</li>
<li> It becomes difficult to operate with 20% of the product remaining.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great lotion. It absorbs easy and does not require much to spread over your entire face. It is very good for sensitive skin as it does not burn dry/cracked skin like other lotions often do. My only criticism is of the bottle/pump. It becomes difficult to operate with 20% of the product remaining. To use at this point you have to remove the top and use the straw tube to fish out lotion. Many lotions have this same problem, however, and overall it&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years.  Although, I&#x27;m not a kid anymore, my skin can still break out.  So, I have to stay away from the heavy moisturizes; lest I look like I&#x27;ve been afflicted with the pox.  Using this product (in addition to the Neutrogena foaming face wash) seems to solve both problems... keeps me well moisturized without the breakouts.</li>
    <li> Great facial moisturizer. I&#x27;m a guy, but this cold weather gives me wicked dry skin, especially when I shave and my skin is very sensitive. This stuff is the best I have used so far. It light and non-greasy (for real), I don&#x27;t break out from it and it has no scent.  Basically I&#x27;m the only one that knows I&#x27;m using it. I used to use Oil of Olay Senstive skin, but it harder to find and not quite as good.  I also love the pump on this product.</li>
    <li> I would have gave it 5 stars however I have noticed that when I use a little more than a drop on certain areas of my face it seems to feel like their is a coating or film on my skin. But overall I am happy with the product and the effects of the moisturizer on my skin do appear to be working.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for five or six years. I have dumb skin: oily in places, dry in others, sensitive, and prone to acne. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make one of the above complaints worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The per-bottle price looks steep, but I usually get two or three months out of one. Definitely worth the cost to me.</li>
    <li> Prefer these because there&#x27;s no perfume, purely functional lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> Have used for years; the best for all skin types because it does not irritate and is easily absorbed.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer to serve as an after-shave after shaving with an electric razor, which always makes my face feel somewhat parched and sensitive.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for 3 months now, and it&#x27;s been working great. I have very sensitive skin which even reacts to some products that are supposed to be &#x27;anti-allergenic&#x27; and &#x27;non-comedogenic&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this moisturizer, and it works great after getting out of the shower, or after washing my face after a long day out.     It&#x27;s great because it gets rid of dry, red skin, and I even use it sometimes on my arms, or neck. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick or oily feeling. After you put this on and let it dry, it feels like nothing&#x27;s there, but your skin is left feeling soft and moisturized.     It&#x27;s pretty expensive - I&#x27;m on my second bottle after 3 months, but I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for many years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that does not irritate my super sensitive skin.  Love this stuff and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The lotion is fine... what is  not good at all is the fact about 1/2 thru the bottle the pumps no longer works and you are left trying to beat 1/2 of the lotion out of the bottle by hand.  Pump bottle are notorious for this and I will avoid them like the plaque for now on.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used as a moisturizer that hasn&#x27;t caused hives or rashes, and I&#x27;ve tried several over the last 20 years. I have skin that gets hives and bumps easily. I highly recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique moisturizer for three decades  but recently decided to try another brand.  As I get older my needs for magic increase.  So I decided to try Neutrogena since I have always found the products they sell to be very good.  I like this moisturizer.  It seems to not irritate my skin.  I can feel that it is doing its job.  At the same time I like the oil in Clinique.  So at this point I am going back and forth.  I think the Neutrogena will be great for warmer months when skin tends to be more hydrated.  I am finding that I rely on the oil based Clinique when the weather is cold and dry.</li>
    <li> Good value and doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne ridden skin with the use of retin a as much as others with sunscreens, etc</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I break out easily and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for my skin. It hydrates but feels light and not at all oily or gross. It doesn&#x27;t cause any problems if you&#x27;re trying to layer sunscreen or makeup over it. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and will continue to do so! Why buy a $50 little container of moisturizer from a beauty store when this works just as well?</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, primarily after a shower, or washing my face. My face tends to get red and dry after washing. This product does a fine job reducing the redness and dryness. In addition, I have noticed the reduction in wrinkles and lines, although the product is not intended as an anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 10 years and I do not have a complaint. They work for my skin since they do not leave a greasy feel on my skin, which I do not like. They moisturize my skin just enough. I have also tried the combination skin product in the same line but that one made me break out. Pimples erupted all over my face and I never had so many pimples on my face at one time, ever in my life! So I switched back to this product and my skin cleared up. However, if you tend to have very VERY dry face, maybe this moisturizer is not the best for you.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> Underwear are of very high quality and are very affordable. Size seems to run a little bit smaller than average. Workmanship is very good, front pouch is rather small,  waistbands are like those found on high end products. Best thing about these underwear is the bamboo fiber they are made of, which seems to be stronger than cotton, is more stretchy and less bulky.</li>
    <li> works well for my oily skin. cost-effective solution</li>
    <li> Used it last night for the first time.  It made my face feels very hydrated and smooth.  I also used the Neutrogena foaming cleanser and toner.  I think I&#x27;ve found a keeper :)</li>
    <li> This leaves my face feeling silky and hydrated and not greasy and heavy</li>
    <li> It works great I have to be careful I still break out Adults acne.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African-American and have been using this product for 6 months and decided to repurchase from Amazon since it saves time and comes in pretty much 2 days (Prime). I love this because it is water-based, oil free and very very light. I have dark skin and I&#x27;ve noticed that it does leave a very very minimal amount of white substance but that could be because it is water based and has no oil binders to hold all the components together, but that is a non issue. One dust off and you&#x27;re set for the day. I don&#x27;t like to use foundation or tinted moisturizer since they tend to darken over time as the day goes by (the &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; effect that fairer skins like to call). So I mix this in with Black Opal Invisible Oil absorbing powder and pat it over my face &#x3D; Awesome! You get a shine-free, non grey face and you&#x27;re face is also moisturized and imperfections are blurred. Thanks for reading!</li>
