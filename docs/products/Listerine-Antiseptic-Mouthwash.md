      <li>It&#x27;s the original Listerine product, and is just what I wanted</li>
      <li>Have been using Listerine original since reading &#x27;Kiss</li>
      <li>My mouth felt clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an aftertaste, but makes me feel clean.</li>
      <li>i know will always clean my entry mouth.</li>
      <li>, it makes my mouth feel clean and tingly, I prefer it to the minty flavors.</li>
      <li>The size is great for me since I do not drive and shopping is limited.  </li>
      <li>Why does everything have to be sweet?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;---For those that go camping, are stocking their medicine cabinets, or are making disaster preparedness \\&quot;bug out bags\\&quot;--I recommend this Listerine original as an essential multi-use item to keep handy.</li>
      <li>The original, brown kind ONLY!  </li>
      <li>on blemishes/acne;&lt;br /&gt;*Quick relief for bug bites;&lt;br /&gt;*Cleaning, disinfecting and deodorizing: I do use a mixture of essential oils to clean/disinfect surfaces, so I do know that this would be an effective cleaning solution, if one were so inclined to use it for that purpose in a pinch;&lt;br</li>

      <li>but now I need to get the right one.</li>
      <li>Mixing Listerine with peroxide not only make it more effective but also save alot of money because peroxide only costs about 90 cents a liter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do this every day and your teeth and gums will be as healthy as you can possibly get them at home.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do this every day and your teeth and gums will be as healthy as you can possibly get them at home.</li>
      <li>Most stores have 1 liter only.  </li>
      <li>To maximize the positive effects of Listerine, it has to be used correctly, so here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried the cool mint and the natural citrus</li>
      <li>Large bottle,  convenience of delivery</li>
      <li>All of these ingredients listed above are essentially plant-based, which means that they are natural, and in my opinion, effective and worthy of my trust.</li>
      <li>Instead, put a \\&quot;small\\&quot; amount in your mouth, and then gently brush your teeth with your toothbrush, working the Listerine into the crevases between your teeth and gums, and in between your teeth.</li>
      <li>but I will choose cool mint or something else in the future without doubt.</li>
      <li>:) I may go back to a minty version in the future</li>

      <li>/&gt;(There are probably many other purposes that this can be used for, but the above are what I am aware of.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The longer contact time means more germs killed.</li>
      <li>Have to find a new flavor, I bought this one</li>
      <li>, I feel like a brand new person after I use it.  </li>
      <li>The low price and large bottle shouldn&#x27;t fool you.</li>
      <li>The longer you use Listerine, the better it works; so brush with it for at least 1-2 minutes per time.</li>
      <li>This is the old fashioned Listerine.</li>
      <li>Since Listerine kills germs by direct contact, you want to get the product into the gum pockets to cleanse them - so use your toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Yes, Listerine does kill millions of germs as advertized, but those germs replicate very fast and will return to regular levels in a very short period of time, so by using it twice or even three times per day, you keep germs depressed all day</li>
      <li>I like the harsh bite this stuff delivers, my mouth feels clean.</li>
      <li>Not many people like the original flavor of Listerine.  </li>
      <li>Cant go wrong with this, although some people prefer the other flavors, this is great.</li>
      <li>After the teeth are clean, vigorously brush the top surface of the tongue to root out the germs that cause bad</li>
      <li>The natural citrus tastes like a flat orange soda, yuck.</li>
      <li>and I know it&#x27;s a psychological thing for me, but I would go so far to say as using this stuff is almost a religious experience for me.  </li>
      <li>My taste buds have never experienced such a thrill as the Original Brown Listerine!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, I got it for a very reasonable price. I rinsed my mouth and brushed my teeth with it.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item in any home. I tried the cool mint and the natural citrus but I like the original more because it doesn&#x27;t have a funny taste and it seems stronger. The natural citrus tastes like a flat orange soda, yuck. Some tips: you can mix it with some water to make it milder (on a cold day, mix it with hot water) or you can mix it with hydrogen peroxide and then brush with it after you brush with your regular toothpaste. Start brushing with an electric toothbrush with one hand then with the other hand, use a water jet and spray the mixture to where you are brushing. This will kill even the germs hidding in the gum lines and pockets. I also use the water jet to spray it between my teeth. I use alot of Listerine. Mixing Listerine with peroxide not only make it more effective but also save alot of money because peroxide only costs about 90 cents a liter.</li>
    <li> I have been using listerine for quite sometime and this one is the best. Works great and makes you feel fresh.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist who uses Listerine on a daily basis. I originally tried this brand (Original flavor), and almost gave up on the product then and there.  The original \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; is HORRIBLE!.  Choose anything but this flavor to get the benefits of Listerine without the horrible but-wrenching taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Listerine because I have seen it work firsthand.  It kills germs associated with gingivitis and bad breath. To maximize the positive effects of Listerine, it has to be used correctly, so here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use it at least two times per day, in the morning and in the evening before bed. Yes, Listerine does kill millions of germs as advertized, but those germs replicate very fast and will return to regular levels in a very short period of time, so by using it twice or even three times per day, you keep germs depressed all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t just swish with Listerine. Instead, put a \\&quot;small\\&quot; amount in your mouth, and then gently brush your teeth with your toothbrush, working the Listerine into the crevases between your teeth and gums, and in between your teeth. These are the areas where gingivitis germs grow and do damage to your gums. Since Listerine kills germs by direct contact, you want to get the product into the gum pockets to cleanse them - so use your toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The longer you use Listerine, the better it works; so brush with it for at least 1-2 minutes per time. The longer contact time means more germs killed. After the teeth are clean, vigorously brush the top surface of the tongue to root out the germs that cause bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After cleaning your teeth with Listerine, you should briefly brush them again with a fluoridated toothpaste. I don&#x27;t care what brand of toothpaste you use, as long as it has the ADA seal of approval and has fluoride in it. Put a small amount on the brush and gently brush your teeth. Now here comes the important part, don&#x27;t rinse with water afterwards! If you thoroughly rinse with water afterwards, you are rinsing off the beneficial fluoride. The goal is to leave it on your teeth as long as possible, so brush, spit out the excess and don&#x27;t rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Floss your teeth once daily. There is no rinse in the world that can kill the germs that infect the teeth and gums in-between your teeth, so it is essential to floss once per day, preferably before bed. This is just as important as brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do this every day and your teeth and gums will be as healthy as you can possibly get them at home. This effort will save you hundreds of dollars, for you will cut down on cavities and the need for expensive dental scalings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine is a good product. As a dentist I recommend it and use it myself. However, the original flavor is simply horrible and you will probably not want to continue using it as it is that objectionable.  The newer flavors are a huge improvement over the original, so use one of them instead.

    <li> The product tastes like meh.  It doesn&#x27;t start to sting till about 20 seconds in of mouth washing.  My mouth felt clean after using it.  I would brush, floss then use this product.  It was a good finisher to teeth care.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the stuff you get a Coscto.  Why does everything have to be sweet?  I like the harsh bite this stuff delivers, my mouth feels clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of citrus listerine. I got two bottles of original and when I checked to return it, it says I can&#x27;t because they violate the flammable liquid policy.  So now I&#x27;m stuck with two bottles of awful tasting original.  Not a knock on listerine just the wrong delivery and no return option.  Price was better than grocery store but now I need to get the right one.</li>
    <li> I love the 1.5 liter size.  Most stores have 1 liter only.  The price was great, better than I found locally.  The size is great for me since I do not drive and shopping is limited.  Getting more at one time helps.</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t leave an aftertaste, but makes me feel clean.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of Listerine for the price. I really like Listerine, its just about the only thing that helps with bad breath.</li>
    <li> Large bottle,  convenience of delivery</li>
    <li> This is THE mouthwash you need to get rid of literally every bacteria you may have lurking in your mouth. It does taste STRONG but it does the trick!</li>
    <li> Not many people like the original flavor of Listerine.  I do, it makes my mouth feel clean and tingly, I prefer it to the minty flavors.</li>
    <li> cured athalic foot  fungus, just soak for 10 minutes</li>
    <li> I love, love, love Listerine!  The original, brown kind ONLY!  And it is precisely the burn that compels me so!  I feel like me and my mouth are getting the &amp;#34;Exorcist Treatment Royal&amp;#34;!  It is just so cathartic, I feel like a brand new person after I use it.  I gargle and leave it in my mouth until my gums are completely numb, somewhere between 5-7 minutes is my guess.  My taste buds have never experienced such a thrill as the Original Brown Listerine!  I LOOOOOVE the way it tastes.  I prefer it to candy!  Of course, yes, I know that hardly anybody agrees with this and I know it&#x27;s a psychological thing for me, but I would go so far to say as using this stuff is almost a religious experience for me.  All other flavors can go to H-E-Double Hockey Sticks!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, and the price was great, you just have to reorder this item, and I did.  You will be using mouthwash</li>
    <li> The low price and large bottle shouldn&#x27;t fool you. It&#x27;s the original Listerine product, and is just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Its listerine what more do you want? My only complaint is the original flavor, i do not ike it or at the very least i would prefer another.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t have the mouthwash more then 10 seconds in my mouth. I have to dilute it. I don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> (A brief history of Listerine):&lt;br /&gt;Developed by Dr. Nicole Dyer Lawrence and Christian Bach as an antispetic for surgical procedures in 1879, Listerine was named after Dr. Joseph Lister who understood understood the importance of, and paved the way for, the necessity of antiseptics during surgery, which of course lessened the number of patient mortalities prior to it&#x27;s implementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always pour a small amount onto my toothbrush prior to adding toothpaste when brushing my teeth. I have confidence that it effectively kills whatever germs are lurking in my brush as well as aiding in adding some \\&quot;Oomph\\&quot; to my dental hygiene routine. This has Eucolyptol: .092%, Menthol: .042%, Methyl salicylate (aka: Wintergreen oil): .060% and Thymol (found in Thyme oil): .064% as it&#x27;s active ingredients. All of these ingredients listed above are essentially plant-based, which means that they are natural, and in my opinion, effective and worthy of my trust. (The inactive ingredients include: water, alcohol (26.9%), benzoic acid, poloxamer 407 sodicum benzoate, and caramel).  I will use this as a mouthwash (despite the very strong unpleasant flavor) when I feel it is needed, such as if I feel my breath is sketchy or if I have irritated area in my mouth, or a sore throat. However, Listerine&#x27;s use doesn&#x27;t stop there. There are many uses that Listerine can be used for that makes it a must-have for every medicine cabinet, some of which I&#x27;ve tried, and some I haven&#x27;t, but are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;*Dandruff (it actually used to advertise this as one of the uses, where a person rinses their scalp with this after shampooing). I ve not had need to do this, but if I were desperate, I would likely try this;&lt;br /&gt;*Treats itching, skin rashes and even assists in fighting the effects of poison ivy, etc. I&#x27;ve tried this, it does help&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;*In a pinch, for a scrape or other cut (I wouldn&#x27;t use it on anything more than a superficial cut, however);&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve read that it will help ease the pain of a toothache, although in my experience, carefully applied clove oil can&#x27;t be beaten in it&#x27;s effectiveness for toothaches;&lt;br /&gt;*To kill/prevent head lice in case someone has come into contact with another who has it. I&#x27;ve never had to use it for this, but this info would  have been handy when I used to \\&quot;do hair\\&quot; and did come into contact with the people who did have it;&lt;br /&gt;*Application for acne;&lt;br /&gt;*Ease blister pain and help prevent infection;&lt;br /&gt;*Dab on blemishes/acne;&lt;br /&gt;*Quick relief for bug bites;&lt;br /&gt;*Cleaning, disinfecting and deodorizing: I do use a mixture of essential oils to clean/disinfect surfaces, so I do know that this would be an effective cleaning solution, if one were so inclined to use it for that purpose in a pinch;&lt;br /&gt;(There are probably many other purposes that this can be used for, but the above are what I am aware of.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---For those that go camping, are stocking their medicine cabinets, or are making disaster preparedness \\&quot;bug out bags\\&quot;--I recommend this Listerine original as an essential multi-use item to keep handy.pain of a toothache, although in my experience, carefully applied clove oil can&#x27;t be beaten in it&#x27;s effectiveness for toothaches;&lt;br /&gt;*To kill/prevent head lice in case someone has come into contact with another who has it.

    <li> Great product, use every day.  Listerine original, I wish had fluoride was added as that would make it even better!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Its the good &#x27;ol classic mouthwash. Cant go wrong with this, although some people prefer the other flavors, this is great.</li>
    <li> This was sold as citrus flavored and it is not. It burns and is awful.  It went down the drain.</li>
    <li> Have been using Listerine original since reading &#x27;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye&#x27; (great book)..it&#x27;s 1 part of a daily regimen..the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the alcohol content..that defeats part of the effectiveness (contrary to popular belief). No need for fancy flavors..they only confuse the palate, which already suffers from the astringent in this mouthwash. Just do it :)</li>
    <li> As most other reviewers note, the taste is absolutely horrific. It&#x27;s laughable, really. I used it two or three times, but now I&#x27;m back on Amazon to get a different flavor. This one is going in the trash can.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Great transaction!</li>
    <li> Have to find a new flavor, I bought this one becasue it&#x27;s the cheapest and have grown to not &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; on taste.  However wife does not like the taste of it so I have to switch.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle at a huge savings! This bottle was larger than expected. I am very pleased. Saw this size at WalMart for almost ten bucks.</li>
    <li> This is the old fashioned Listerine. It tastes like Listerine.  I love it and my family makes me order the Citrus flavor for them.  A good product at a great Amazon price.</li>
    <li> Everything is covered in other reviews besides one thing. After I ordered I was wondering if this Original Listerine would give me fresh breath like the minty versions as this is the brown frown. :( Well glad to say it does leave your breath/mouth feeling cool and clean, maybe from all the alcohol in it. :) I may go back to a minty version in the future but I am happy with this version so far.</li>
    <li> this large 1.5 liter bottle works for my use, it fit just perfect on top of my bathroom sink,&lt;br /&gt;i remember using this mouthwash for as long as i remember, using this i know will always clean my entry mouth.</li>
    <li> It depends, i mean the taste of this product is definitely not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someone likes it but I will choose cool mint or something else in the future without doubt.</li>
    <li> This one is a bit harsh, but you feel it doing the job in your mouth, unlike the other ones on the market.With the other brands you cannot tell or feel the effect. With this one you know its working.Definitely the only one i purchase.</li>
    <li> A dentist recommended this too me after my first visit, which was as an adult, because as twisted as it seems to me now, me wanting to brush my teeth as a child was &amp;#34;just another excuse to stay up late&amp;#34;. Bed time was bed time I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, all my teeth were in tact and fairly healthy. My gums were a little lacking though, so the dentist said to use Listerine, &amp;#34;The brown one&amp;#34;, he said. I have used it every since, and it has worked great.</li>
