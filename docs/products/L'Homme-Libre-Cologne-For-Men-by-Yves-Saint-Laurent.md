      <li>i bought this for my boyfriend and he love it.</li>
      <li>This fragrance has a very sweet smell, so its not one that you will wanna were allot of.</li>
      <li>Very cool bottle.</li>
      <li>thanks, smelling good</li>
      <li>My dad has sensetive allergies but this cologne is very mild smelling that it didn&#x27;t bother him at all.</li>
      <li>I would caution however that it is quite strong</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this scent</li>
      <li>Cheap price.</li>
      <li>its a matter of personal taste of coure, but this is a great scent for a guy.  </li>
      <li>Very clean and fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>A light, clean, not woody, yet manly.</li>
      <li>Smells clean and is not too over powering.  </li>
      <li>I recommend first-time cologne users to purchase this first for an erotic masculine scent.</li>
      <li>He loved the gift and wears it daily.</li>
      <li>One of my absolute favorite colognes.  </li>
      <li>you so may not know exactly how strong it will project until you&#x27;ve been moving around a bit.</li>
      <li>too clean, fresh and spicy for me, I guess should have taken a sample test before ordering .</li>
      <li>I thought it would have a fresh clean smell like aqua digior or cool water because most clear color colonges do.</li>
      <li>The actual stuff smells even better than that!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what my son wanted for Christmas at about 1/2 the price of the stores I saw it in the mall!</li>
      <li>If you like fragrances with a spicy scent or a fresh scent, this one is neither, so dont buy it.</li>
      <li>Not strong but pleasant.  </li>
      <li>will like it the first time you use it .</li>
      <li>This is the second YSL she had purchased for me and love both of them.</li>
      <li>I first saw it in a magazine</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not fake...</li>
      <li>great scent lasts a long time, i&#x27;ve had this fragrance before, but preferred this smaller bottle for travelling</li>
      <li>its last, and to be honest at first I like the scent when you first spray it, but hours later when the scent becomes less strong, it smells even better, I just want to hug my bf longer</li>
      <li>So this year I bought a bottle for myself and feel like this is a manly scent, not too strong and definitely not like a fruity flower or as I already said not like a musk.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Mixes very well with my skin type</li>
      <li>Burberry is my primary, this is my next in line.</li>
      <li>Real cologne.</li>
      <li>It is very intoxicating.  </li>
      <li>If I put on too much, I start to cough.</li>
      <li>I gave the whole bottle away.</li>
      <li>The top notes project very well for the first 30 minutes, then it calms down.  </li>
      <li>My new scent!</li>
      <li>Another classic created by Yves Saint Laurent.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a new summer scent,this is it.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon had the exact same size for about 50%</li>
      <li>and it was the first cologne I actually wanted because of the sample they put on the page.</li>
      <li>I enjoy that it is very long lasting.</li>
      <li>I like the clean, slightly spicy smell - with no notes of musk which always seems to make me smell unwashed or like a moose in the woods.</li>
      <li>Maybe I received a gray market bottle or old inventory.</li>
      <li>Wear this frequently.  </li>
      <li>I bought this directly from Amz, not a third party.  </li>

<li> It is long lasting but, not overpowering.</li>
<li> Its duration depends on how active you are: If you are running errands, then the strength of the scent will dilute (down), but if you are just in a relaxing state with not much productivity, then it will last for a whole day.</li>
<li> The mid notes last for maybe two and a half hours.  </li>
<li> L&#x27;Homme is great cologne, but this version is TERRIBLE.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s scent however was really not for me.  </li>
<li> I only have had 2 comments about it and one was negative.</li>
<li> I am disappointed that a fragrance from a higher end perfume house like YSL only lasts 3 to 4 hours.</li>
<li> It has grown on me after a few days of use.</li>
<li> can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
<li> After 3 hours, the scent starts to fade to the point where I can&#x27;t even detect the base notes.  </li>
<li> Smelled terrible.</li>

    <li> Good price. Got here on time.</li>
    <li> My dad has sensetive allergies but this cologne is very mild smelling that it didn&#x27;t bother him at all. He loved the gift and wears it daily.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best smelling cologne I have owned so far. I first saw it in a magazine and it was the first cologne I actually wanted because of the sample they put on the page. The actual stuff smells even better than that! If you like to smell smooth then this is the stuff for you!</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  bought it for my husband and son</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing and was at an even better price.  Smells clean and is not too over powering.  Lasts quite some time too</li>
    <li> This cologne smells like bottled sex. Just saying. I bought it for a male friend and boy what a mistake that was.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, love this scent!</li>
    <li> Yves Saint Laurent is a respectable and reliable brand.  It&#x27;s scent however was really not for me.  I wear another of their cologne which is perfect, so I give YSL 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use it as a form of public contact.  I am a deputy sheriff, and in many cases my &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; does help disarm (so to speak) the situation. I have had occasions where the &amp;#34;perp&amp;#34; has said, &amp;#34;god, you smell good.&amp;#34;  So, I just take it from there.</li>
    <li> its last, and to be honest at first I like the scent when you first spray it, but hours later when the scent becomes less strong, it smells even better, I just want to hug my bf longer so I can keep on smelling it lol its a Great cologne</li>
    <li> its a matter of personal taste of coure, but this is a great scent for a guy.  you wont mistake it for perfume but it still smells nice.</li>
    <li> Last year, I bought his for a gift and was always stealing a squirt when visiting/ I like the clean, slightly spicy smell - with no notes of musk which always seems to make me smell unwashed or like a moose in the woods. So this year I bought a bottle for myself and feel like this is a manly scent, not too strong and definitely not like a fruity flower or as I already said not like a musk. Love it.</li>
    <li> too clean, fresh and spicy for me, I guess should have taken a sample test before ordering . lesson learned.</li>
    <li> great scent lasts a long time, i&#x27;ve had this fragrance before, but preferred this smaller bottle for travelling</li>
    <li> Soothing aroma and woman are pleased with the scent.

    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and it smells great and he loves it too so can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Excellent price and excellent product.</li>
    <li> It stays on my shirt for days and it was irresistible...I saw it at Macy&#x27;s for $ 95 and its&#x27;s much more cheaper on Amazon. Trust me it&#x27;s not fake...</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and the size option. Works perfect for what I was looking for. Great price for the size.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best men&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> My new scent! Fast shipping great product.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my boyfriend and he love it.</li>
    <li> The top notes project very well for the first 30 minutes, then it calms down.  The mid notes last for maybe two and a half hours.  After 3 hours, the scent starts to fade to the point where I can&#x27;t even detect the base notes.  After 3 to 4 hours, the smell is totally gone, it is not even a skin scent. I am disappointed that a fragrance from a higher end perfume house like YSL only lasts 3 to 4 hours. I bought this directly from Amz, not a third party.  Maybe I received a gray market bottle or old inventory.</li>
    <li> This has a very nice fragrance smell for my husband. It is long lasting but, not overpowering. A light, clean, not woody, yet manly. I find it very sexy.</li>
    <li> I really liked it as a gift. My wife loves the smell. This is the second YSL she had purchased for me and love both of them. Mixes very well with my skin type and she just loves to hold me when I have it on.  Great price also.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne.  Not strong but pleasant.  Very clean and fresh scent.  It is very intoxicating.  A must buy for a man who likes to smell fresh or to buy for a man who likes to smell good.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a new summer scent,this is it.&lt;br /&gt;You will like it the first time you use it .</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this scent and I have received compliments when out in public. I enjoy that it is very long lasting. I would caution however that it is quite strong so take care when applying. Also I have noticed it seems to be body heat responsive you so may not know exactly how strong it will project until you&#x27;ve been moving around a bit.</li>
    <li> Smelled terrible. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I gave the whole bottle away. L&#x27;Homme is great cologne, but this version is TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what my son wanted for Christmas at about 1/2 the price of the stores I saw it in the mall!</li>
    <li> One of my absolute favorite colognes.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on this for the past few years and was upset when I couldn&#x27;t easily locate it at Macy&#x27;s recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had the exact same size for about 50% the cost!Mao this was a win win.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long. If I put on too much, I start to cough.</li>
    <li> Another classic created by Yves Saint Laurent.  This is the summer version of L&#x27;Homme.  The longevity is great and the smell is fresh and uplifting.  As with virtually all of the YSL colognes, you can expect compliments.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has a very sweet smell, so its not one that you will wanna were allot of. It has grown on me after a few days of use. I only have had 2 comments about it and one was negative. If you like fragrances with a spicy scent or a fresh scent, this one is neither, so dont buy it. I thought it would have a fresh clean smell like aqua digior or cool water because most clear color colonges do. Not this one. I have used several Yves Saint Laurent colonges and have like all of them but this one.</li>
    <li> AWESOME scent.  Wear this frequently.  Burberry is my primary, this is my next in line.</li>
    <li> I wear this and get many comments on how nice I smell and others asking what I am wearing. Always nice when others notice and appreciate the fragrance. Would for sure purchase this one again</li>
    <li> Smells great. Love the smell. It&#x27;s a Perfect size and price. I would buy again for sure. Very cool bottle.</li>
    <li> thanks, smelling good</li>
    <li> Real cologne. Cheap price. Fast delivery. Enough said.</li>
