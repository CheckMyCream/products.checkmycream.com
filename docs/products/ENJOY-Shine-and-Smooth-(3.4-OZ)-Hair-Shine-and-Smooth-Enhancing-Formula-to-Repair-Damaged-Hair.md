<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice.  Will buy again but beware it is very potent!  I don&#x27;t spray directly on hair as it will make greasy spots.</li>
    <li> Since getting the expensive keratin treatments I&#x27;ve tried many different serums to try and get the same effect without the cost of treatments and this one has been a lifesaver! I apply a small amount throughout my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and it not only helps tame my frizz but it makes my hair so soft and shiny! I love it and can&#x27;t live without it. Certainly love the price too! Remember it&#x27;s a serum, you do not need to use a lot so this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> This keeps my really curly hair smooth and controlled.</li>
    <li> love this product, the fragrance, feel and smoothing action...a little goes a long way, start with a small amount in your hands rather than directly applying it to hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, can make your hair oily if you use to much in one application so use sparingly. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Not any difference than other smoothers but lots more $$$$!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years!!  Not only does it make it incredibly easy to comb wet, tangled hair - when dry, my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I enjoy Enjoy products and this one is not an exception. It keeps hair smooth. And it lasts quite a while, which is nice since it isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> Stock pile love the feel of my  car...</li>
    <li> I have very wavy hair with a lot of fly-away&#x27;s and this product works really well on my hair.  I have fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It makes my hair shiny and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I love Enjoy products and this is just another amazing product they make. Keeps all the frizzies away, smells great, and makes your hair super shiny-I recommend buying this product</li>
    <li> Enjoy Sine and Smooth is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to use too much either.</li>
    <li> This works great for my thin waist length hi lighted hair! I use a very small amount and my hair has a pretty shine and is smooth and soft! Makes combing my.hair after a shower so much easier! Smells good too!! All enjoy hair products are fabulous! :)</li>
    <li> I have terrible problems with the frizz! It really does a great job!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> enjoy products are wonderful for thick hair. They are often difficult to find. This is a bit cheaper, no tax and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have tried a million products like this and don&#x27;t really like any of them.  This product works great, smells great and I love it.  BTW, my hair is very course and thick and nothing works as well as this product does</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look great. No more frizz. About a dime size in your palm, rub hands together them apply to your towel damp hair. Comb hair to remove tangles. Air dry or dry &amp; style, hair looks great! Feels great too. Smooth not flyaway.</li>
    <li> I just love this enjoh shine.  My hair tends to frizz-up now a cays and this keeps my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for shine this product does not really create shine, BUT it makes your hair super soft. I straighten my hair every day, so i have split ends but after straightening my hair ill put a small amount on my hair and it transforms it from dry and dead to smooth &amp; soft ! Also it lasts a while so its a good investment and smells great too !</li>
    <li> This product does keep my hair silky &amp; smooth plus eliminating frizz (which is its purpose). I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have naturally curly hair and use it when I wear my hair straight or curly.  No frizz and smooths hair nicely!</li>
    <li> I returned it.  It did absolutely nothing to help my hair.  My hair seemed to be a lot more frizzy after using this.  I do love the shampoo and conditioner in this line, but not this.</li>
    <li> Worked great and was here quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It was recommended by my hairdresser to use on my extensions, and it&#x27;s kept my hair from getting too damaged with all the heat tools I use on it. However, make sure you only use a tiny amount because your hair will look greasy otherwise. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair.. I thought this product would help to smooth and shine my hair as stated on bottle but after using it a few times .. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in  the smoothness nor taming of frizzies!!</li>
    <li> Love Enjoy products in general and was really glad when I cam across this. I normally have stick straight hair, but when I curl it using curling irons, curlers..whatever it may be it gets so frizzy! This takes care of the crazy frizziness I don&#x27;t normally have when its just normally straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell could be overpowering for some, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
    <li> Very lightweight product with a pleasant smell and leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> This product does not go on heavy. Many smoothing, shining hair products weigh my hair down or cause excessive oiliness. This does neither. I love it. You can use it on dry or wet hair and it works. I love this brand!</li>
    <li> gives shine and depth without heaviness - I have white hair and this product gives just the right shine and form</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dry and frizzy. I can dry it smooth and straight with various products. But it still won&#x27;t have any shine until I put this stuff on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. It really does make your hair soft and shiny. Me and my daughter use it and we love it. Good service too.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this after cutting my hair and also gave me a sample.  I loved the way my hair looks when I use this product as my hair is course and tends to stick out and frizz.  This product really tames my maine and makes my hair look smooth and shiny just like the name!  Try it you will love it too!</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this for 7 years! I used it sparingly as you can see. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to realize I should get rid of all the other products I had. I have wavy/curly hair and it is pretty fine as well (texture, not being vain here!). I have had lots of trouble with products weighing my hair down or feeling sticky. This one has been perfect. I use a little when I get out of the shower and scrunch it in my hair. It leaves my hair soft and curly with out all the frizz that I often get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I was using it sparingly because I had looked for it in stores I would go to and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I was happy to discover it on Amazon. I would have given 5 stars the only problem is when it was shipped to me the safety seal was broken and little pieces of it were suspended all throughout the bottle. I was refunded right away but this meant I still was out of this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Never used it before. found that it did not hold hair as well as the creamy pomade. just ok for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and I love it! Makes my hair super soft and smooth and shiney!! A must have!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair shine product.  I add a dine sized amount to my towel dried hair before blow drying or air drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds a lovely shine.  I also use it sometimes to tame a away fly aways.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hands down the best smoothing serum I&#x27;ve used.  No residue, no weird smell just soft shiny waves and no static either!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter uses this product to help smooth out her curls.  She&#x27;s told me that if she had to choose only 1 product, the Enjoy Shine and Smooth would be the hair product that she would choose.</li>
    <li> Really great for color treated hair. Smooths it out nicely.</li>
    <li> Great product - have used for years</li>
    <li> I do a Keratin treatment every 6 months.  Enjoy Smooth and Shine is my daily choice to apply before blow-drying to keep my hair looking smooth without weighing it down.  Great product I keep re-ordering.</li>
    <li> it leaves a sticky residue on my hair. when i first put it in its fine but as the day goes on it starts feeling gross. when I first got it it didn&#x27;t do that so maybe it&#x27;s just gotten old? it started doing it about a month after I got it. I&#x27;d only used it a couple of times before it went bad, but it used to work very nicely...</li>
    <li> Smooth and shine just like the title says and big bonus this one smells better than so many similar products.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. RECEIVED TIMELY</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells yummy</li>
    <li> I have straight hair but it gives it that out of the salon shine and blow dry look hard to achieve at home.  It makes straight hair look like it&#x27;s been flat ironed!&lt;br /&gt; My aunt was staying with me and forgot her hair product at home. She said she could never get the frizz out of her hair. She tried Enjoy Shine and she absolutely loved it!  It worked great on her hair.</li>
    <li> The product arrived leaking all over the place. I had to clean off all of the oil that leaked all over the bottle. I then opened the bottle and noticed about 1/8 of the oil had leaked out. I then tried to product and noticed the consistency was extremely thin, as if the product has been watered down.</li>
    <li> This has a fruity scent. It isn&#x27;t strong and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells. My problem is I just don&#x27;t feel this does much for shine and very little to smooth my hair. It does make my hair soft. I have normal texture with a little damage on the ends.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my had from drying out when I flat iron it and from getting gnar frizzy after a shower.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, leaves my hair silky smooth and smells nice too.  Just put a few drops in your hand and rub your hands together and smooth on your hair.  No greasy or sticky feeling ever.  It makes your hair shine and its good for it to, especially if you flat iron your hair.  You can distribute a little bit on your hair just before you use your flat iron and it will feel really smooth.  I have been using it now for at least 3 years.  Plus this is a really good price ($13).  You can&#x27;t get it in the stores for less.</li>
    <li> Enjoy can be hard to find but my dry curly hair is always so much softer and looks nicer using Shine &amp; Smooth. Plus a little goes a long way. Have medium to long hair and this lasts me 6 months at least.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it, but I have a hard time finding it and now I don&#x27;t live near any big beauty supply stores. Amazon carries anything you need whatever you&#x27;re looking for. I have had nothing but great experiences with Amazon so I use it all the time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect hair products for my hair.  I have fine hair so I need to be careful what I use.  This product smells good &amp; gives a good shine. It is easy to apply, using a small amount, non-oily &amp; works better when my hair is curly. However, it tends to weight my fine hair down.  There isn&#x27;t an oily feel to the hair, just flat.  My daughter has thick, beautiful hair and it works much better on her.  Keeps the frizz down with a pretty sheen &amp; control.  I feel this would be a good product for thicker hair clients.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s very similar to CHI smoothing serum only with a lighter scent. Non greasy and helps take care of frizzes while smoothing the hair. Doesn&#x27;t take much!&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products expensive and cheap, but this one beats them all. I have what I call the \\&quot;used brilo pad hair\\&quot;... Just crazy frizzy and awful... Unless I use the damaging iron everyday. I have NEVER been able to put a product in my hair when it&#x27;s wet, let it air dry, and have to do a minimal touch up with an iron of some sort. With this product you CAN. I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
