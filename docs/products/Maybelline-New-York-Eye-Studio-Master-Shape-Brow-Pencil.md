### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The product itself is awesome.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, the shade is perfect for redheads.</li>
      <li>The spool on the end blends the color in great and separates the hairs from where the wax clumps up, and it WILL clump up.</li>
      <li>If Maybelline would put this in a wood pencil form or in a self-sharpening plastic pencil this would be a great product.  </li>
      <li>did get around the problem, because I loved the product, and wasting my money was not an option for me.  </li>
      <li>but this item is good quality and value for the money.</li>
      <li>Replace the brush, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
      <li>A good color</li>
      <li>That could&#x27;ve been two more inches of auburn to use!</li>
      <li>Writing to them, for sure, on this one!</li>
      <li>It was nice for the 1 week I got out of it.</li>
      <li>My brows are getting thinner and this pencil fills in the gaps nicely.</li>
      <li>I love the pencil and the color.</li>
      <li>Such an awesome color !  </li>
      <li>I love this brow product.</li>
      <li>I really love the way it holds my brows in place, and it comes in many colors to match most brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is now a wood pencil that is easy to sharpen.  </li>
      <li>I use a higher end sharpener (Urban Decay grindhouse, $10) and it sharpens it perfectly.</li>
      <li>The pencil I have is wood and sharpens just fine.</li>
      <li>The last pencil I purchased was greatly improved.  </li>
      <li>, just get yourself a proper cosmetic sharpener and not one from the dollar store and you will be happy with this pencil.</li>
      <li>Maybelline created a nice soft, semi-waxy product that holds the color pigment and is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Like the wooden pencil better.</li>
      <li>After trying many brow products made for redheads including brow tints, I was relieved to have finally found one that worked.</li>
      <li>I tried to Urban Decay brow box and many Mac products</li>
      <li>(and its a big but) :)&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t sharpen it, so I bought a Revlon Sharpener that works on plastic pencils.</li>
      <li>Maybelline used to make a light brown in a regular wooden pencil, which you had to sharpen yourself, which was really no problem, went on well and matched my red hair color perfectly.  </li>
      <li>and it also has a little brush on the end for keeping your brows tidy.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for a natural redhead and my eyebrows don&#x27;t look fake when I use</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>You have to muscle it in a pencil sharpener but the force needed to peel the plastic causes much of the product to break off or get mashed in the sharpener.  </li>
      <li>This was my only option for an eyebrow liner in any kind of red shade.</li>
      <li>The brush on the other end seems to have been designed for micro lashes: it doesn&#x27;t really work on brows.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a product that has not been tested, for sure, before launch.</li>
      <li>It seems counter-intuitive, obviously the wax is going to get warped from how hard you&#x27;ll have to push and twist to be able to dispense more product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wasted a good third of the product this way.  </li>
      <li>product is older, and it appears that some people have purchased a newer design that has been improved.  </li>
      <li>This review is for my older product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is a coppery red blonde, and this really matched up and made my hair color and eyebrows look more natural together.</li>
      <li>At $9 for this I&#x27;d expect to be able to use it without as much trouble as I&#x27;m expecting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please, Maybelline, you know I love you, but put it in a wooden pencil and make it just a tad harder</li>
      <li>still have to shape the very soft point with my fingers to get it to hold shape.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal though, because the wax is so soft and it really holds your eyebrows in place without making them look \\&quot;drawn</li>
      <li>Clearly, they had to know that anyone purchasing it was going to have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would recommend this to any natural redhead out there</li>
      <li>Soft means it doesn&#x27;t pull at your brows or skin when applying, but not so soft that it runs or smears.  </li>
      <li>That finally worked after much maneuvering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;This could have been a 5/5 product for me if not for the silly plastic that makes no sense design wise.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they made a pencil that needs to be sharpened out of plastic and then use such a soft kohl for the color.</li>
      <li>I actually prefer the plastic design to a wood one because the tip has not once broken off inside the sharpener like I have experienced in the past with wood eyebrow pencils, and I have been through several of them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They could have at least included a special sharpener for this thing.</li>
      <li>If there is any crayon left in the pencil after you have used it down to the entrance, you certainly can&#x27;t advance it.  </li>
      <li>Most brands only carry black, ugly brown, or blonde but nothing for red heads.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline came up with just the right natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...</li>

<li> I didn&#x27;t get to check if the color would be right for me or not, seemed too waxy, as I tried to apply broken off point to back of my hand to test.  </li>
<li> I was excited to find a creamy pencil in auburn; but when I used it down past the tip, a hard piece of plastic coated the crayon.  </li>
<li> The little brush on the end makes a big difference.</li>
<li> When I use this it&#x27;s hard to tell that I&#x27;m not a natural red head.</li>
<li> I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about.</li>
<li> Sadly, redheads don&#x27;t have a whole lot of options in the eyebrow pencil</li>
<li> I was scared this product wouldn&#x27;t match my hair, but over all I feel like it does, my only complaint is that it&#x27;s alittle crumbly.</li>
<li> Every stroke, it gets mushed down and I have to shape it again.</li>
<li> Half of it ends up on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
<li> but the plastic is so thick I could only sharpen it with an electric pencil sharpen and then the hard plastic coating cuts into your skin.</li>
<li> It is so frustrating to believe you&#x27;ve purchased a twist-up pencil, only to discover that it&#x27;s a plastic casing around the product that you are supposed to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Every time I sharpen it it crumples and applies messily.</li>
<li> so I can keep a narrow point on it.</li>
<li> As it is I feel I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this...</li>
<li> Terrible color, more orange than auburn.</li>
<li> This pencil is in a plastic usually reserved for self-sharpening pencils.  </li>
<li> but I was never satisfied.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what Maybelline was thinking when they designed this product.  </li>
<li> This pencil is too soft, too wide, extremely difficult to sharpen and looks artificial on brows.</li>
<li> Tried sharpening but it was extremely hard.</li>
<li> Seriously, for what purpose Maybelline?</li>
<li> This is by far the worst product I have bought.  </li>
<li> I just wish they hadn&#x27;t wasted two inches on a stupid brow wand that I never use.</li>
<li> Sharpening is a extemely difficult it is plastic coated.</li>
<li> Someone at Maybelline messed this one up, badly.</li>
<li> At this point, I was just so frustrated.  </li>
<li> It has a plastic casing so sharpening seems really stupid.  </li>
<li> Unless I am doing something very wrong, this pencil is the worst pencil I have every used.</li>

    <li> This pencil is too soft, too wide, extremely difficult to sharpen and looks artificial on brows. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst product I have bought.  Sharpening is a extemely difficult it is plastic coated. Tried sharpening but it was extremely hard. Never buy again!</li>
    <li> Went to apply, point broke off, then it would not wind up, so I didn&#x27;t get to check if the color would be right for me or not, seemed too waxy, as I tried to apply broken off point to back of my hand to test.  Maybelline used to make a light brown in a regular wooden pencil, which you had to sharpen yourself, which was really no problem, went on well and matched my red hair color perfectly.  I don&#x27;t need the brush or the twist up, sometimes, when you have something that works, it doesn&#x27;t need to be improved.  Dissappointed!</li>
    <li> Maybelline created a nice soft, semi-waxy product that holds the color pigment and is easy to apply.  Soft means it doesn&#x27;t pull at your brows or skin when applying, but not so soft that it runs or smears.  The problem is the pencil design.  This pencil is in a plastic usually reserved for self-sharpening pencils.  Not so here.  You have to muscle it in a pencil sharpener but the force needed to peel the plastic causes much of the product to break off or get mashed in the sharpener.  I&#x27;ve wasted a good third of the product this way.  If Maybelline would put this in a wood pencil form or in a self-sharpening plastic pencil this would be a great product.  As it is I feel I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Unless I am doing something very wrong, this pencil is the worst pencil I have every used. I was excited to find a creamy pencil in auburn; but when I used it down past the tip, a hard piece of plastic coated the crayon.  I read that you are suppose to sharpen it just like a regular pencil but the plastic is so thick I could only sharpen it with an electric pencil sharpen and then the hard plastic coating cuts into your skin.</li>
    <li> It is so frustrating to believe you&#x27;ve purchased a twist-up pencil, only to discover that it&#x27;s a plastic casing around the product that you are supposed to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot;. Someone at Maybelline messed this one up, badly. Writing to them, for sure, on this one!</li>

    <li> I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about. The pencil I have is wood and sharpens just fine. I love the pencil and the color. I just wish they hadn&#x27;t wasted two inches on a stupid brow wand that I never use. That could&#x27;ve been two more inches of auburn to use!</li>
    <li> The product itself is awesome.  I really love the way it holds my brows in place, and it comes in many colors to match most brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product is older, and it appears that some people have purchased a newer design that has been improved.  This review is for my older product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the majority of the reviewers stated, the problem occurs when the presharpened end is used up.  It appears that it would twist, and it doesn&#x27;t.  It has a plastic casing so sharpening seems really stupid.  There are no instructions explaining what you should do when the tip runs out.  I&#x27;m not sure what Maybelline was thinking when they designed this product.  Clearly, they had to know that anyone purchasing it was going to have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get around the problem, because I loved the product, and wasting my money was not an option for me.  Remove the brush on the end and the cap underneath that.  I used my teeth, although you may want to use a tool.  At this point, I was just so frustrated.  Now you can use a Q-Tip to push the liner up.  Replace the brush, and you&#x27;re good to go.  I just threw away the white cap.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews on this before purchasing it! I got 1 week&#x27;s use out of this pencil. It won&#x27;t sharpen in my sharpener and it doesn&#x27;t twist up so I&#x27;m out of luck! It was nice for the 1 week I got out of it.</li>
    <li> The last pencil I purchased was greatly improved.  It is now a wood pencil that is easy to sharpen.  Seems they heard the feedback and improved the design.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome color !  Most brands only carry black, ugly brown, or blonde but nothing for red heads.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline came up with just the right natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;BUT... (and its a big but) :)&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t sharpen it, so I bought a Revlon Sharpener that works on plastic pencils. That finally worked after much maneuvering.&lt;br /&gt;I still have to shape the very soft point with my fingers to get it to hold shape.  Every stroke, it gets mushed down and I have to shape it again. Half of it ends up on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Please, Maybelline, you know I love you, but put it in a wooden pencil and make it just a tad harder so I can keep a narrow point on it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this... the tip of the pencil is the only part you can use...you can&#x27;t sharpen it either. never again.</li>
    <li> My brows are getting thinner and this pencil fills in the gaps nicely. I have never used a pencil before. The little brush on the end makes a big difference. I think next time I will try a liquid with a wand but this item is good quality and value for the money.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;master shape\\&quot; only lasts for about 6 applications since it is barely 1/4 inch long.  The crayon, of course,gets depleted; and then it does not advance: I tried twisting, pushing, nothing happened. If there is any crayon left in the pencil after you have used it down to the entrance, you certainly can&#x27;t advance it.  The brush on the other end seems to have been designed for micro lashes: it doesn&#x27;t really work on brows.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a product that has not been tested, for sure, before launch.</li>
    <li> Only auburn pencil I can find. Like the wooden pencil better. Could starpen point. Lasted LOTS longer. This pencil only lasted two weeks with once daily use.</li>
    <li> Terrible color, more orange than auburn. Every time I sharpen it it crumples and applies messily.</li>
    <li> I love this brow product. After trying many brow products made for redheads including brow tints, I was relieved to have finally found one that worked. I tried to Urban Decay brow box and many Mac products but I was never satisfied. It is perfect for a natural redhead and my eyebrows don&#x27;t look fake when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the people on here posting dissatisfied reviews feel that way because it does not twist up, and despite being made of plastic you need to sharpen it. I have never found that to be a problem for me. I use a higher end sharpener (Urban Decay grindhouse, $10) and it sharpens it perfectly. I actually prefer the plastic design to a wood one because the tip has not once broken off inside the sharpener like I have experienced in the past with wood eyebrow pencils, and I have been through several of them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any natural redhead out there, just get yourself a proper cosmetic sharpener and not one from the dollar store and you will be happy with this pencil.</li>
    <li> Like the others I&#x27;ve got an issue with the sharpening of this product. I don&#x27;t understand why they made a pencil that needs to be sharpened out of plastic and then use such a soft kohl for the color. It seems counter-intuitive, obviously the wax is going to get warped from how hard you&#x27;ll have to push and twist to be able to dispense more product. They could have at least included a special sharpener for this thing. At $9 for this I&#x27;d expect to be able to use it without as much trouble as I&#x27;m expecting. I&#x27;ll post an update when I finally have to sharpen it, which I&#x27;m not looking forward to. This was my only option for an eyebrow liner in any kind of red shade. There were literally no others in my store where I bought this. Sadly, redheads don&#x27;t have a whole lot of options in the eyebrow pencil market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the shade is perfect for redheads. My hair is a coppery red blonde, and this really matched up and made my hair color and eyebrows look more natural together. When I use this it&#x27;s hard to tell that I&#x27;m not a natural red head. The spool on the end blends the color in great and separates the hairs from where the wax clumps up, and it WILL clump up. It&#x27;s not a big deal though, because the wax is so soft and it really holds your eyebrows in place without making them look \\&quot;drawn on\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have been a 5/5 product for me if not for the silly plastic that makes no sense design wise. Seriously, for what purpose Maybelline?</li>
