      <li>and it is the best!</li>
      <li>The best part of this mascara is its brush</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Butterfly Mascara is one of the best, best mascaras I have ever used.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>but it works perfectly for my sparse lashes AND it meets both my criteria.  </li>
      <li>Best waterproof mascara ever.</li>
      <li>I especially love the wing part of the brush.</li>
      <li>One side also works great on the lower lashes without clumping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Great mascara for the price</li>
      <li>great mascara.</li>
      <li>Goes on great and leaves great results.</li>
      <li>Best mascara, love the brush, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>and I loved that one</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely in love!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara!</li>
      <li>The brush is the perfect size and shape; lashes are slightly curled, separated and coated perfectly.</li>
      <li>Amazing inexpensive mascara.  </li>
      <li>This goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>looks nice no clumping</li>
      <li>nice product.</li>
      <li>That mascara is still the best, high end or drugstore.</li>
      <li>It washes off very easy with MaryKay eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I just prefer the smoother, more volumizing mascara.</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara at the moment.</li>
      <li>With the exception of the flaking, I love the brush, how it goes on and how it makes my lashes look.</li>
      <li>I love this waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>I love waterproof mascara and this lives up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>This purchase was mostly for the novelty of the product.</li>
      <li>Gives me length and volume:)</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I love everything about it.</li>
      <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
      <li>After a long day of 7 AM to 11 PM... the mascara is still on perfectly and won&#x27;t even come off with soap or tears.</li>
      <li>It removes easily at night.</li>
      <li>It takes about 3 light applications to get the lashes looking thicker and longer.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the way the bristles are makes for a super easy application.</li>
      <li>Super nice, goes on fast and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara so much!</li>
      <li>A basic good mascara.</li>
      <li>The waterproof is great because I never wind up with the black hazy look under my eyes.</li>
      <li>The brush really does shape your lashes to fan out at the ends, mascara goes on smooth without clumps, and gives lashes lots of volume.</li>
      <li>covers the lashes nicely and adds some length (visually).</li>
      <li>If you are prone to raccoon eyes with even waterproof mascara, this mascara is worth a try.</li>
      <li>Mainly because of how much thicker the mascara is than the original!</li>
      <li>Use the curved end for the top of your lashes and get every single lash coated in one swipe, and the other end for the bottom lashes, it&#x27;s super skinny and perfect for coating those short hairs.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>I think from now on, If I want to &#x27;waterproof&#x27; my look, I will add a coat of this on top of my regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cant be sure how it was stored prior to it</li>
      <li>But considering it does exactly what I have been looking for</li>
      <li>The formula is definitely on the wetter side, but I found that it was more lengthening than it was voluminous.</li>
      <li>So I would be willing to try it again.</li>
      <li>Love the shape of this brush - really extends the outside lashes.</li>
      <li>, I love how long my lashes look when I put it on.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the regular one either, but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
      <li>No smears and really adds a lot of volume fast.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really neat.</li>
      <li>And it really is waterproof, no smearing.</li>
      <li>Really does give you the butterfly look.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>so sometimes I add one of my other mascaras on top.</li>
      <li>New holy grail mascara!</li>
      <li>My new GO TO waterproof mascara!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have to use an eyelash curler just to make them tilt in the right direction and even then, with all the different mascaras out there</li>
      <li>I love the way it fans out my lashes, the only thing is the color isn&#x27;t deep enough for me</li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so hard to put a couple layers on, while keeping my lashes volumized, I would be in love with it.</li>
      <li>But it washes completely when I remove my makeup.</li>
      <li>My old mascara  was discontinued over a year ago</li>
      <li>and I have been trying ever since then to find a waterproof mascara that was not only REALLY waterproof, but also made my lashes visible.  </li>
      <li>Only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t really give you the winged look for your your lashes.</li>
      <li>so much it was the only one I used.</li>
      <li>Have tried over 20 different mascaras, including high end ones, and this is the only one that does not smudge.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll usually buy whatever name-brand product is on special at my local drugstore, and I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that didn&#x27;t work for me before, until this one.</li>
      <li>The brush style was a bit awkward at first, but easy to catch on.</li>
      <li>but it is a little too much for me</li>

<li> but it is a little too much for me</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a black mascara, that separates your lashes and makes them look naturally plump.</li>
<li> It catches all my little lashes near the inside of my eyes.</li>
<li> I thought they would be the same, other than the waterproof feature.</li>
<li> Pretty mascara , but very very hard to remove</li>
<li> I use this every single day.</li>
<li> They do volumize and make eyelashes very long!</li>
<li> Usually, it takes a few gentle motions to remove a waterproof mascara, but I literally had to scrub my eyes with an eye makeup remover pad to get this stuff off.</li>

<li> Even though I have never had a problem with waterproof mascaras in the past, so I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
<li> It is also smudge-proof and flake-proof, plus it holds my eyelashes in an upward facing direction all day (no more droopy eyelashes for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Sadly, this product ended up in the trash after only two days of wear.</li>
<li> I wear contact lenses, and when I wore this mascara, my eyes became incredibly dry and uncomfortable throughout the day.</li>
<li> The lash applicator is not effective for me.</li>
<li> It is a little expensive but the waterproof version lasts all day.</li>
<li> --I think the mascara was flaking off throughout the day, getting into my contact lenses, and irritating my eyes.</li>
<li> I also found this mascara surprisingly difficult to remove using an eye makeup remover.</li>
<li> I was having a difficult time meeting my two criteria of waterproof and visibility</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this waterproof mascara. I wore it every day while in Cancun for a week &amp; later in Cabo for a week. Never once did it flake off or smear. It washes off very easy with MaryKay eye makeup remover. Best waterproof mascara ever.</li>
    <li> stay on well. looks nice no clumping</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness!  Finally.  My old mascara  was discontinued over a year ago and I have been trying ever since then to find a waterproof mascara that was not only REALLY waterproof, but also made my lashes visible.  I happened upon this mascara on clearance locally and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have been cursed with thin blonde eyelashes, and also some Asian ancestry that presents itself only in the eyelash department. This means I have sparse, blonde, downward facing eyelashes that practically require a microscope to see.  I have to use an eyelash curler just to make them tilt in the right direction and even then, with all the different mascaras out there I was having a difficult time meeting my two criteria of waterproof and visibility simultaneously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found perfection in this mascara.  Yes the brush is like nothing I&#x27;ve used before but it works perfectly for my sparse lashes AND it meets both my criteria.  I now look like I have eyelashes, and it is truly waterproof.  It is also smudge-proof and flake-proof, plus it holds my eyelashes in an upward facing direction all day (no more droopy eyelashes for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately ran back to my local store to try and get several packages at their discount price.  Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed that this mascara never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite mascara. I have tossed out all my Maybellines and Revlons.  Way back in the olden days there was a comb mascara and I loved that one so much it was the only one I used. This one has three options including one that is comb like. One side also works great on the lower lashes without clumping. And it really is waterproof, no smearing. Go ahead, give it a try.</li>
    <li> A basic good mascara. The brush style was a bit awkward at first, but easy to catch on.</li>
    <li> The applicator brush pulls at my eyelashes, and causes irritation to my eyelids. I tried to use it once, but threw it away half way through.</li>
    <li> Super nice, goes on fast and lasts all day. No smears and really adds a lot of volume fast.</li>
    <li> Amazing inexpensive mascara.  My only gripe is that it needs oil-based eye makeup remover to take it off.  It lasts all day w/out running or flaking.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day. If you like &amp;#34;spider lashes&amp;#34; this isn&#x27;t the thing for you. It&#x27;s a black mascara, that separates your lashes and makes them look naturally plump. The waterproof is great because I never wind up with the black hazy look under my eyes. But it washes completely when I remove my makeup. I do use an oil based makeup remover around my eyes but I never have lashes falling off or the ugly clumps so it&#x27;s awesome. Only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t really give you the winged look for your your lashes. HOWEVER, the way the bristles are makes for a super easy application. Use the curved end for the top of your lashes and get every single lash coated in one swipe, and the other end for the bottom lashes, it&#x27;s super skinny and perfect for coating those short hairs. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara! I love everything about it. The brush is the perfect size and shape; lashes are slightly curled, separated and coated perfectly.I always buy the waterproof version. It removes easily at night.</li>
    <li> I love waterproof mascara and this lives up to my expectations. The brush really does shape your lashes to fan out at the ends, mascara goes on smooth without clumps, and gives lashes lots of volume. There is no flaking, smudging, or eye irritation. Best mascara I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the way it fans out my lashes, the only thing is the color isn&#x27;t deep enough for me so sometimes I add one of my other mascaras on top. But considering it does exactly what I have been looking for I don&#x27;t mind at all. Every one likes how it look, I just ordered one for my mom too.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara so much! I have been using it for a while now and it is the best! It is a little expensive but the waterproof version lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This goes on nicely. The applicator is designed to permit you to get the lashes at the corners of your eyes. It takes about 3 light applications to get the lashes looking thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> My new GO TO waterproof mascara! I love it! I especially love the wing part of the brush. Goes on great and leaves great results. Took forever to come off while I was rubbing my eyes with eye-makeup remover, but that just let&#x27;s you know that it did it&#x27;s job! Time to stock up!</li>
    <li> great mascara. stays in place and makes my eyelashes pop</li>
    <li> Love the shape of this brush - really extends the outside lashes.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara at the moment. It catches all my little lashes near the inside of my eyes.</li>
    <li> The best part of this mascara is its brush</li>
    <li> Great mascara for the price, I love how long my lashes look when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes. The brush was awkward and didn&#x27;t grab every lash. Disappointing. I prefer the l&#x27;oreal telescopic carbon black. That mascara is still the best, high end or drugstore.</li>
    <li> This purchase was mostly for the novelty of the product. The formula is definitely on the wetter side, but I found that it was more lengthening than it was voluminous. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pretty mascara , but very very hard to remove</li>
    <li> New holy grail mascara! Absolutely in love! Gives me length and volume:)</li>
    <li> Best mascara, love the brush, lasts all day. Will only buy this one from now on!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very picky about my mascara. I&#x27;ll usually buy whatever name-brand product is on special at my local drugstore, and I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that didn&#x27;t work for me before, until this one. I wear contact lenses, and when I wore this mascara, my eyes became incredibly dry and uncomfortable throughout the day. I didn&#x27;t have redness or itching, so I don&#x27;t believe it was an allergy--I think the mascara was flaking off throughout the day, getting into my contact lenses, and irritating my eyes. I also found this mascara surprisingly difficult to remove using an eye makeup remover. Usually, it takes a few gentle motions to remove a waterproof mascara, but I literally had to scrub my eyes with an eye makeup remover pad to get this stuff off. Instead of coming off, it would clump and make my eyelashes stick together. I was afraid my lashes were going to start falling out! Sadly, this product ended up in the trash after only two days of wear.</li>
    <li> The lash applicator is not effective for me.</li>
    <li> So the reason for 3 stars is because I have tried the regular Voluminous mascara(not waterproof). I went and bought this one when every local store was low on it. I thought they would be the same, other than the waterproof feature. I was wrong. This is such a hassle to use. Mainly because of how much thicker the mascara is than the original! I&#x27;m assuming because it&#x27;s waterproof? Even though I have never had a problem with waterproof mascaras in the past, so I&#x27;m not really sure. It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as the regular one either, but it does it&#x27;s job. After a long day of 7 AM to 11 PM... the mascara is still on perfectly and won&#x27;t even come off with soap or tears. That&#x27;s what I like about it. If it wasn&#x27;t so hard to put a couple layers on, while keeping my lashes volumized, I would be in love with it. I just prefer the smoother, more volumizing mascara. I think from now on, If I want to &#x27;waterproof&#x27; my look, I will add a coat of this on top of my regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Butterfly Mascara is one of the best, best mascaras I have ever used. They do volumize and make eyelashes very long! Definitely give them a try! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> thought I would like the brush but it is a little too much for me</li>
    <li> This mascara stays put. Really does give you the butterfly look. Makes lashes look thicker and longer. Have tried over 20 different mascaras, including high end ones, and this is the only one that does not smudge. If you are prone to raccoon eyes with even waterproof mascara, this mascara is worth a try. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Some people like the wand on this mascara, some don&#x27;t. I like it very much. What didn&#x27;t work so well for me was that it tends to flake off. Since I ordered this online I cant be sure how it was stored prior to it arriving to me or if that had any effect on the formulation. With the exception of the flaking, I love the brush, how it goes on and how it makes my lashes look. So I would be willing to try it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this. especially the wand/brush. I like how one side has almost a rubber comb to sift out clots. it has several different &amp;#34;sides&amp;#34; for different angles and types of eyelash. the mascara itself seems kind of thick, but not too bad. if for whatever reason they ever discontinue this, I&#x27;ll keep the wand and attempt to use it with whatever mascara i have. it&#x27;s really neat. I&#x27;m happy. covers the lashes nicely and adds some length (visually). nice product.</li>
