    <li> OMG! Finally a product that works on my 4c hair! This product was recommended to me by an acquaintance on Google+.  She said she swore by it so I immediately came to Amazon to compare prices with the product website. This is THE BEST product that I have found that actually moisturizes and my hair stays that way. Usually at the end of my day, my hair has dried out and will tend to shrink; not with this. I have wasted so much time and money on other products but not any more.  I love it!</li>

    <li> This is a great product. It keeps my hair nourished as I use it daily and it does not cause a lot of build-up. I use to buy this moisturizer at the local beauty supply store but it is only half the size. This size is much better and so is the price.
