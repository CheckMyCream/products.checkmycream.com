<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just received this wig . I absolutely love everything about it . It&#x27;s long and thick and doesn&#x27;t have that wig shine look to it. The packaging it comes in is super cute and I love that it comes with a comb and wig cap.</li>
    <li> really good quality wig especially for the price</li>
    <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t the color that I was looking for. It sheds a lot, and the bangs are a bit crooked, but the wig is soft.</li>
    <li> Great fit! Kinda tight- I thought my head was going to explode but it looked so natural! Make sure to youtube how to put on wig before purchasing it because the hair net that comes with it has a hole on the top. The front bangs were too long so I had to cut it shorter so I can see. It does tangle very easily so be careful.</li>
    <li> The quality is JUST amazing. This looks very expensive. Super impressed.</li>
    <li> Fits well, pretty thick for how much you pay.</li>
    <li> Really great wig, especially for the price!! I used it for a Marceline the Vampire Queen Halloween costume. It looked beautiful, and I got many compliments. Only downside: it&#x27;s a little hot and itchy if worn for a few hours, but what can you expect from a wig?</li>
    <li> Gets tangled easily, but expected for a long wig. It&#x27;s thick, it looks real, I love it. It&#x27;s a lot higher quality then what would be expect for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this wig a LOT. Very versatile and great quality! The free wig cap came in handy too! It&#x27;s a little thin, but nothing a few clip-in extensions couldn&#x27;t fix! Took to my flat iron like a DREAM. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Mortal Kombat cosplay. It&#x27;s okay... not great, bangs are weird.</li>
    <li> Love the wig and arrived faster than I expected! I will make a great voodoo princess!</li>
    <li> the quality of the hair is great. It&#x27;s very long. I cut it a little. I wear it with a hat. Looks very realistic. With the price, I am totally happy with this purchase. Might purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> The wig is really nice, and it came a day early. I would recommend this wig to others.</li>
    <li> for this wig i tried it on right when i got it in the mail..it fits perfectly..there are hooks to adjust the size..it arrived sooner than i had thought which is even better..the hair feels really smooth..it sort of reminds of me the long hair like in a horror film called the ring or some other japanese horror film..but i am pleased with what i got..the price is good and when it came it was in a good condition</li>
    <li> Knotted a little at the bottom, but amazing quality for a cheap wig!</li>
    <li> It is so realistic, my mom thought it was real hair when I showed it to her! I had to convince her it was synthetic. It is a little long but that could be easily fixed with some scissors. :) I definitely recommend this and I am planning on buying the curly black one soon!</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price!  Looks natural and has a wonderful shine to it</li>
    <li> I was generally pleased with this wig. The length and color were perfect. It is also pretty good quality and doesn&#x27;t shed a lot.  It looks nice and worked well for my costume. The only issue I had was a little peak at the top of the wig because my hair wasn&#x27;t completely flat underneath it.</li>
    <li> I just love these wigs...I have purchased other colors. They are very inexpensive ad look very much real. It looks and feels like natural hair. I&#x27;m growing out my hair and wearing these helps give me a more feminine look from time to time. It&#x27;s a great bargain!</li>
    <li> It was delivered in a nice package, however, my only issue with it is that it may be itchy (virgin wig wearer) and it gets VERY KNOTTY if you don&#x27;t maintain it every so often. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a lovely color and it looks like real hair (not artificial looking)...as long as you keep those knots out, haha</li>
    <li> Its amazing cant go wrong I promise.</li>
    <li> The wig I ordered was delivered on time and is really high quality. It looks very realistic in luster and color. It can get a bit tangly but a lot of wigs around this length do. It&#x27;s also pretty small, and I can just get the wig over my large head (I was expecting this though since its an asian wig). I have yet to wear it for an extended period of time, so I can&#x27;t say if it gets uncomfortable, but for the price I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap higher quality wig.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t opened it yet but hope be good</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume and absolutely loved it.  People I had never met before thought that was my real hair.  Highly recommend, this wig is definitely not just a costume wig, it is very natural-looking.</li>
    <li> People were shocked to find that it was not real, when I was wearing it.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this so here is her review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wig about 2-3 days ago and I just recieved it today.  For the price, this is an AMAZING wig! It&#x27;s great quality, and looks real.  I was hesitant to buy this at first (since this is my first time buying a wig online) but once I put it on, adjusted it to my liking, I don&#x27;t regret buying it. The length goes down to about the waist (I am 5&#x27;4), the color says it&#x27;s black but I would call it more of a black with brown undertones. The comb that they give you glides through the hair easily.  If you are looking to buy an inexpensive, great quality wig, I highly reccomend this one!  Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I dont think it was nessically the wing but It seemed like someone had already happened it and then just shoved it in the box.</li>
    <li> Love this wig!  Great wig for the price!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with the quality of this wig. I ordered the long straight black one and it arrived folded up in a small box, so it had a lot of kinks and tangles straight out of the package. It was not straight and I don&#x27;t know if a flat iron could be used on it (I didn&#x27;t try.) The parting was also very weird. It was off-center and messy, and the side bang cut was not done very well because the side where the bangs start was cut so high that my natural hair poked out very obviously. It was just a mess, looked cheap and fake. I didn&#x27;t open the comb or wig cap but the comb looked really cheap in the package; the teeth seemed to be almost falling off. Luckily there are free returns on this product otherwise I would be very upset about wasting money on this wig.</li>
    <li> It started out really great. Amazing new look and all. But the hair got tangled so fast, my head kept spinning. The silky look lasted less than a week and that probably because I wasn&#x27;t wearing it all day long. I don&#x27;t think I got a great bargain, but the wig is ok. Don&#x27;t have too much expectation just enjoy the wig till the end.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t review stuff. I&#x27;m lazy. But I am reviewing this. Amazing stuff, I&#x27;ve bought two of the MelodySusie wigs, this one and the long dark brown one, and I love them both. I have a small forehead, so I cut the bangs on this one into straight bangs. I did this myself in the bathroom mirror, and while I was finding pieces of synthetic hair all over my face for a while, it wasn&#x27;t hard and didn&#x27;t look bad. Easy styling is a big plus in my book. Also, the color is very good. It&#x27;s a true black color, doesn&#x27;t shine bluish or anything like that. I wore this to the grocery store and stopped for a sample and to chat with an employee, and she complimented me on my hair style. &amp;#34;Want to know a secret?&amp;#34; I asked her. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a wig.&amp;#34; She was really surprised. &amp;#34;It shines a little at the top, but the rest of it looks so real, I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed,&amp;#34; she told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is, because this is straight hair, I have to brush it a little more often to keep it smooth looking. The synthetic doesn&#x27;t really deal well with being handled too much (it gets the equivalent of frizzy), but for the price, that&#x27;s hardly a draw back. I&#x27;m definitely buying this type of wig from now on. A++ in my books.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous dead straight hair wig.  Doesn&#x27;t look too fake either.  Wig is very long and very, very straight.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Smooth, so real looking- amazing wig- for the $$ I was pleasantly surprised! I give it 5 stars! I want to find other colors,shapes and sizes with this company for sure&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this wig. Its soft and beautiful. Its long too so u can cut into ur desired style one u get tierd of the long</li>
    <li> I would always roam around Amazon looking at wigs on my spare time out of curiosity. My mother wears wigs &amp; when I tried on one of her own, I just told myself I had to buy one of my own. Thankfully, I found this &amp; I love it dearly! It does shed a bit, but if you manage it calmly, it&#x27;ll look beautiful on you :)&lt;br /&gt;It seriously unlocked my desire &amp; want of other different wigs, but I do recommend this wig for first-timers ^_^</li>
    <li> the bacgs are not true to picture and are ver annoying to deal with also it is NOT black !!!</li>
    <li> It barely sheds, the first day I got it I ran my fingers down it and one strand came out. Very soft. Will definitely buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black wombman and it looked really good on me. It does shed quite a bit and it does give a hard time to comb out AND it tends to know easily and fast. Not a log term wig for sure but a short term like a one use would be fine.</li>
    <li> I like it. Arrived maybe 4 days after ordering, which is always nice. The length and feel of the hair is nice, although not bone straight like the picture. I will have to get it straightened, and the bangs trimmed just a little bit. For the price, very nice. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh!! It also comes with wig cap and wig brush (a little cheap one, but hey, it was nice to see the complete package). Sweet!</li>
    <li> This wig gets tangled way too fast it&#x27;s not even worth the Money you pay I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Tangles a little bit but not unexpected for a wig this long. Overall made it through the day a whole lot better than I expected. Worth the price but definitely not meant for day to day wear.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig, very full and fit great. I&#x27;m SUPER excited to wear it to my next con</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the wig was really cute and fun.</li>
    <li> I was anticipating a non-layered, straight black wig for a cosplay, but I received a layered, slightly wavy wig (although I think the waviness may be due to its packaging). The box in which is was shipped in is nicely sturdy, and I enjoyed the inclusion of the wig cap and &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; wig comb. The fibers are thin, but believable because of its matte appearance. All in all, not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture, It is so pretty and fits well and the only complaint is the tendency of the hair to tangle, but other then that it is a great wig.</li>
    <li> Its really nice, just like a real hair wig. Nobody would ever know.</li>
    <li> this is a decent wig, i had worn it among my friends and they said that it looks real. would recommend if one wants a long wig.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Wig.  Well worth the money. Love it and will be buy another one.  Highly recommend.  Feels like real hair</li>
    <li> Gorgeous wig, I wear it so often</li>
    <li> excellent! looks real! it&#x27;s amazing! I love it so much. bravo.&lt;br /&gt;this looks real, and I love it so much. everyone who needs a wig should order here.</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice, a lil long will have to cut it... It looks brown in the sunlight more than black but it&#x27;ll do for my 3 day vacation :)</li>
    <li> This wig is nice if you style it and keep it that way, I braided it and it stayed nice but after I took it out to brush it. It got tangled and was unwearable.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s as amazing. It arrived timely even on weather raining days in Northern California. This wig outdoes other wigs. Great! Money is not wasted. Very good for Inuyasha movie main protagonist girl cosplay. I use this for Spring Season Sakura Party with my cute Japanese traditional kimono. This wig suits better for Asians.</li>
    <li> It looks so natural and is very easy to style. Best wig I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
    <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve bought and I love it :) ignore the negative comments! It&#x27;s really soft and really long! It&#x27;s tangles a little easy but from what I&#x27;ve heard most synthetic hair does! You should get it :p</li>
    <li> Wit was good at first and then got extremely frizzy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because of all the reviews and the price (also the customer pictures.!) I received it in 2 days, thanks to Prime. It came out of the package looking very nice and smooth, my goodness the curls were fantastic! I ordered the M712 Dark Brown. It is a very beautiful, rich level 3 dark brown. It did tangle, but any long fake hair piece, wig or extensions, are going to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends had no idea it was a wig, my boyfriend asked if I got new extensions, and some other friends asked if I just colored my hair or just did something different. I had to go to a 3 day class and I got lots of compliments on how pretty my curls were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like is that it does not have the wig combs/clips attached on the inside. So I went to Sally&#x27;s and grabbed some extension clips and sewed one on the top in the front, and one at the nape to make it stay secure while it was on. After I did this, it did not slip around my head or budge, even in the crazy North Texas wind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few wears I wanted to smooth it back out and refresh the curl, so to wash it I filled up my sink with COLD water and 2 cap fulls of fabric softener(cheap dollar tree kind), and soaked the wig for about 15 minutes. After that, I rinsed it out by soaking it again in clean water. I put it on my wig stand to dry and let it sit for a little bit. The wig dries very fast, and once it was slightly damp I sprayed with a mixture of 1 part fabric softener, and 3 parts water and let it dry completely. After I combed out the tangles with the provided comb, then brushed it with a looper wig brush and just tousled it lightly. The wig is just as soft as before, the curls staye in tact (make sure to use cold water, hot water will take all the curl out) and made it not tangle so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you take care of any of your synthetic hair pieces in this exact manner to get the most use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an amazing wig that I will wear many more times, and after this review is submitted, I will be ordering the M708 Light brown wig. If you have any wig or extension care questions, or any questions about this wig in general- just ask! Hope I have helped at least a little bit!t I will wear many more times, and after this review is submitted, I will be ordering the M708 Light brown wig.

    <li> my brother end up using it for Halloween  lool</li>
    <li> I bought this as a costume wig to play Marceline and it works perfectly. The bangs need a little bit of work, but the hair looks great, and there&#x27;s a lot of it. Yes, the ends tangle, but I&#x27;m not sure you could have a wig go down to your butt and stay perfectly untangled the whole time. It is very long. It&#x27;s a costume wig, and it is WAY better quality and price than what you would find in a Halloween store. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good quality inexpensive costume wig.</li>
    <li> Love it pretty and long it gets tingle a bit....but its a okay comes with a comb and a wig cap</li>
    <li> Just came today and let me say it thicker the bangs are awesome its full and its long but its not straight it&#x27;s got some wavy to it but i love it im african american and even though it long it still looks good only prob i had was not the color i wanted i asked for black and was charged for it but i got num 3 dark Brown but its okay i it looks good on me the wig is also layered so if u want to cut it it will still look good but i would not also with all wigs id suggest u buy a detangler to keep it fresh i will be buying from seller even recommend this wig to anyone</li>
    <li> This wig is definitely worth the money. The hair feels almost realistic and is made of great quality. The package included the wig, a comb, a few collectible tags (collectibles from the company that made it) a hair net, and a nice thin bag to put the wig inside of.&lt;br /&gt;A little forewarning: the wig does take a bit of combing and maintenance before it will look like it does in the picture. Its not messy per say, but it is not as straight as depicted in the picture when its opened out of the box for the first time. The comb that comes with it is really nice for combing the wig with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what you get, this is definitely worth buying if you want a high quality wig for a lower price. I have spent money on more expensive wigs that are nothing compared to this one. It is definitely worth the money, and I plan on buying a few more to match some items in my wardrobe.</li>
    <li> Always keep this in mind when buying a wig..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) If its not a human hair wig, it WILL TANGLE EASILY.&lt;br /&gt;2.) If you buy a CURLY WIG, USE A COMB TO TAKE OUT TANGLES.&lt;br /&gt;3.) If its STRAIGHT, use a BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;4.) Always buy a 2nd wig cap in case the first one breaks!!</li>
    <li> Horrible wig, didn&#x27;t fit my head and gave me a headache!</li>
    <li> very nice wig for the price!</li>
    <li> wig I bought for roleplaying. came tangled and was a bitch to untangle. I&#x27;m glad it came with a professional grade wig comb.All and all this is a great quality wig it just takes some time to get it how its shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this and wore it two times before the ends became frizzy. Not to be racist or anything, but it was the same texture as a african american girls hair. I cut the frizzed part off and it was great again. A few days later, it frizzed again. Now it is to short to cut anymore but I still love it. :( It is a love hate relationship...</li>
    <li> the hair is does not look too plasticky (if thats a word) but it tangles like crasy. I had to cut off more that half the length and made the wig a shorter cut so that my arms wouldnt fall off from having to comb through it literally every second. the shorter hair is easier to manage but i dont know if i will wear this outside. too afraid of it tangling up. also the size is kind of big but straps are present.</li>
    <li> Looks just like how it did in the picture, came with a wig cap and comb, fits quite nicely. My only problem would be that it tangles easily, but other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this wig</li>
    <li> the ware house deal pack is missing comb, wig cap and the hair is tangled.&lt;br /&gt;nothing similar to &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig it just tangles and sheds like crazy. But its to be expected for the price I paid. So I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I bought one while in the navy a year ago, I loved the color, feel, and everyone thought it was real. So I just bought a new wig to retire my old wig. Cant wait</li>
    <li> The wig is soft and it looks just like the picture. It is a Melody Susie wig. It shipped fast and I&#x27;m  completely satisfied. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Good quality wig for the price.</li>
    <li> I used this twice for a performance. This looks beautiful, but once it tangled, it is hard to untangle. If you are not planning to use it again and again, that should be okay. It comes with a comb, but the quality of comb was poor.</li>
    <li> This is such a good wig it looks and feels very real</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an  ok wig tangle up very fast and shed very bad won&#x27;t be wearing it as much as I thought fast shipping though is the only reason why I gave it a 3 stars</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the delivery, product and packaging of the product. Honestly i was surprised but again i was and am very happy. The bangs are a little long and need to be properly be combed and styled for it to swept to the side but that was the only thing i can i have to do. otherwise i recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> This wig is great. I would recommed it to anyone. The hair has a great texture. I&#x27;m going to order another one like this. Plus it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive either!</li>
    <li> Kind of annoying to wear for long periods of time b/c it tangles really easily, otherwise looks nice.</li>
    <li> This hair looks and feels like real hair very full hair very long !!! completely satisfied!  Thank-you!!!!</li>
    <li> The five stars are for the customer service.  I was unhappy with the wig, it got tangled within the first few minutes. The cap of the wig is very small, even for my small head(I am very petite, under 5 feet tall) and the wig fell off my head when I looked up, even with a stocking cap underneath.  Not bad for a costume party if you don&#x27;t mind bobby pins to keep it in place.  The quality is not good for wearing to work or a regular party, which is what I wanted it for, so I requested to return it.  But when I saw how expensive the return shipping was (almost the same as the cost of the wig), I contacted the seller to say I won&#x27;t be returning it after all.  They graciously offered to refund $5.  I am pleased with the courteousness of the seller even though I was disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Solid wig. Nothing has fallen apart and it looks awesome on! Perfect for streaming and might even wear to a con.</li>
    <li> Very nice, used for a cosplay and didn&#x27;t style much, just cut shorter. Good price, soft hair. Would buy from them again!</li>
    <li> Loved this wig, had some issues but it&#x27;s all okay now.</li>
    <li> Soft, gorgeous wig. Long bangs that you sweep to the side, and very long hair. I needed it shorter for a costume, and it was easy to cut. If needed, I would buy it again. I&#x27;ve bought maybe 6 wigs ever, and usually spend $30-$40, but this has felt the highest quality. Others may have had more hair, but were lower quality and not as smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is such a great wig! This is the second wig I ended up ordering for my Mareceline costume, after the first was a total failure (the fail wig was NOT from MelodySusie), I found this wig and took a chance on it. I was not disappointed. This wig is NOT fake and shiny looking. It has a little bit of shine, but not that plastic looking shin. Also, on this long black straight wig, there are LAYERS already cut into the wig, which gives it more body and movement. It looks much better than the straight wigs that are all one length. There is some slight waves to it, it is not totally straight, but in my opinion, that also makes it look more full. Overall, I really like this wig and it is a really good quality for the money.</li>
    <li> Average, it got tangled really easily, but it looks nice for one-time use.</li>
    <li> Quality is good looks reals but gets tangled too easily</li>
    <li> Surpisingly well built for the price. Fits well and looks real . amazing product</li>
