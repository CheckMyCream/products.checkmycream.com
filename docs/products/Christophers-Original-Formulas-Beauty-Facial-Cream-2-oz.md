<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, may not be a miracle cream but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks more even.</li>
    <li> this is good but it is kinda greasy. I only use it at nite but it has helped some dry patches go away.</li>
    <li> All of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells really bad. Maybe it stored in the warehouse too long some of the cream melted on the cap and seal was broken when received.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every night. It does have a strong herbal smell to it, but ive gotten use to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im currently on my 2nd jar of it</li>
    <li> OK, this stuff really smells bad, but then I was warned about that ;)  That being said, it does seem to be making my skin better and it helped to heal a small burn on my face, even helping with the scar I had.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Thick, soaks in quickly, face is moisturized in morning.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; service!</li>
    <li> Much too Greasy and doesn&#x27;t rub in.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This arrived opened, literally, lid unscrewed and product drying out.  The tub itself looked dirty and old even though the expiration is next year.  My guess is that is why these are cheaper than usual.  I was so excited to try this cream, but I will be returning this dirty tub that is definitely not in &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; condition, and buying this product from somewhere I can trust.  I had read similar reviews, but didn&#x27;t think Amazon would let this continue - I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Love it, a must have for every family, smoothed off my skin within days, great product.</li>
    <li> I love this herby face cream. It&#x27;s an excellent night cream because it is dense. When applied, it leaves the skin shiny but by morning, the cream is all absorbed and it makes the skin very soft. I had some broken capillaries when I started my first jar and just over a month later they are gone. Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my pores seem to be much smaller. I looked up the properties of each herb and they do wonderful things for skin!&lt;br /&gt;I always apply to washed, damp skin for better absorption. Also, for day, I cut it with a much lighter cream--about half and half.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fabulous skin cream.</li>
    <li> showed up on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The top was half opened when received, and the cream was melted. I&#x27;m not sure if its still good.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my pores looking smaller and my skin seems tighter. I have never used a night cream and rarely use moisturizer of any kind due to breakout prone skin. When I first started using this at night I did start to have a few pimples, but they were very tin, not like regular acne and I could tell it was likely a purging situation so I stuck with it for another couple weeks. Now my skin has gotten used to the cream and no more pimples. I use a tiny bit (size of a pea for my entire face) during the day as a moisturizer. If you use too much it never fully soaks in. At night I put it on as an eye cream and facial moisturizer. It is light and feels nice on your skin. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it goes on smooth, smells great and I put it on my eyelashes at night and they have grown so long!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream and am so glad I found it. It is super moisturizing and a bit thick/oily, so I only use it at night on my face. I have bad excema on my hands and I use this on them too. It is one of the few moisturizers that does not sting open cuts at all. This is a must have moisturizer and it is so inexpensive for what it offers.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but 3 of my jars did not have a protective lid of the four i ordered, one of the lids was almost screwed off and melting into the box; not happy about that. But using the product itself you do have to use very little or it can get greasy but it doesn&#x27;t take much to use at all and once it soaks in the smell goes away and skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Most of the things I order is based upon the reviews, and this is one of them.  I am an African American and my skin glowed as if I was eating right.  My skin absorbs it so well.  I look dewy and glowing and I didn&#x27;t breakout.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 because it is natural with most of the herbs from the COMPLETE TISSUE REPAIR treatment and I really love that combination.&lt;br /&gt; BUT, I don&#x27;t use it on my face! It is too thick. Very dry skin may do alright with it, but I need a lighter facial cream. It is great for the shoulders, hands and neck.  The back of my arms get kind of GRAINEY feeling, and this healed that in a couple of weeks. So be creative and have fun!</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to fragrances or pungent smells then you need to stay away from this ointment.  If on the other hand you enjoy the odors of diesel fumes and gardenia powder mixed into a thick greasy ointment that you apply all over your face including right under your nose, then this is the perfect beauty treatment for you.</li>
    <li> This is truly a moisturizer that keeps your skin moisture in the desert climate!  When your skin is getting dry, after you used all kinds of commercial, highly claimed, expensive items.  You will eventually find Dr. Christopher&#x27;s facial cream can do it.  It is reasonably priced and all natural, it may have a little distilled water came up to the surface once in a while, but nothing really is an issue.  I love it because it has been my salvation for my skin which is a combination type of skin.  Dr. Christopher&#x27;s product keeps my skin youthful, supple and prevent it to be blemish-free!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! The best moisturizer! Only takes a little. My mom and I use it at night.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product three times. I rub it on my face before bed and when I wake up my face looks and feels rejuvenated! My forehead lines&lt;br /&gt;are not as deep as they were and some of my acne scares are lighter already! The product said to use it a lot more often then I have been, but I don&#x27;t feel its needed. Another thing that I like about this product is how natural it is. I feel good knowing that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of non needed chemicals on my face. I am going to by this product again and have already recommended it to all the girls in my family.</li>
    <li> Great men&#x27;s facial cream. I put this on every night before I head to bed, makes my skin feel nice and smooth following day. ..</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used. I use it on my hands and on my face. I wake up in the morning with baby skin. I would buy this by the gallon if I could. Smell isn&#x27;t roses but it&#x27;s worth it for the great results. I&#x27;m a nurse and my hands take a beating with all of the hand washing...this stuff is a game changer.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my daughter.  She used it everynight and her face got really smooth, so I decided to use it.  I really love it because after 2 weeks of using it, i can clearly tell the difference.  To make your face feel better when apply the cream, I suggest to put the cream in your cooler for about an hour before use it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe nobody I know hasn&#x27;t used this. My skin is reducing in wrinkles in a few weeks</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer at an affordable price. It works as well, if not better than any high-priced name brand cosmetic moisturizer. I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the scent so I use a basic affordable moisturizer containing collagen for my less-than-young complexion but turn to this when cold weather or sun exposed skin needs extra help.</li>
    <li> Everything else about the product sounded good. Some reviews did mention the &amp;#34;gardenia&amp;#34; fragrance, but I was not prepared for the strength of the odor. I can&#x27;t wear it on my face or neck - it&#x27;s too strong. Not even sure I could wear it on my feet, but that&#x27;s probably the only way I can use it. Wish it didn&#x27;t have any fragrance and I could still try the rest of it. Oh, well...</li>
    <li> I really like this face moisturizer. I agree that it might be a little to greasy for day use, but applying it at night really sets your face up for a beautiful morning. I apply it generously and have had absolutely no problems with breakouts. My face is moisturized and looks really good. A little goes a long, long way; and one jar will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American and the months of January and February were extremely hard on my hair, making my ends very dry and brittle. I found that putting a wee amount of this on my ends helped with the dryness, without making the hair greasy or losing the ability to bump the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it beneficial for any dry spots on the body. Overall, this is a great find/buy that can serve multiple functions when it comes to dry skin or hair. Being all natural, you don&#x27;t have to worry about side effects or misuse. It&#x27;s both good for you and good to you. Buy some and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Feel like I&#x27;m really helping my skin and it is all natural, no preservatives or additives and the price is great.  Best price anywhere</li>
    <li> Thick, moisturizing, and makes my skin happy, instantly. A little goes a long way. Great for use at bedtime, but can be used in the morning as well. I&#x27;m not as fond of the fragrance, but can deal with it knowing that nothing in it is artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the thickness, the cream will spread easier if it is slightly warmed up on the back of the hand or palm for a moment before blending onto the face. I recommend dabbing it over several spots, then blending in, rather than putting it in one spot and trying to spread it all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I came to purchasing this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long ago given up typical commercial products, especially in terms of personal care and hygiene. The list of chemicals is often a paragraph or two long, with ingredients that are considered highly toxic. I&#x27;m keen on looking for and using ingredients that are organic, natural, and rate low on toxins. In this pursuit, I have come to make my own all natural, non toxic face creams and other personal care products. My formulations use healthy oils, herbs, essential and oils. Most turn out great, some won&#x27;t be replicated, but at least I know what is going into the formulation. I&#x27;m healthier and happier for this. However, I came across this product when searching for tooth powders (I wanted to try making another type of toothpaste). This company came up in search results. While I didn&#x27;t purchase Christophers tooth powder, I was intrigued by the other products, especially the face cream. It has very few ingredients, and what it does have I know what they are and what they do. I didn&#x27;t see anything that was too concerning, and was curious how the product worked in comparison to some of mine. It would be nice to have the option to easily buy something than to always make my own and hope it turns out the same way each time. I ordered the product and began using it right away. I am glad I did, as my skin reacts well with it. Fresh, healthy, hydrated skin! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love love love this beauty ointment. It makes my skin super soft and my skin is re-hydrated soon after putting only a small bit on my face. And the smell is pleasant too. Thank you Dr. Christopher for making such awesome natural products that really work! :)</li>
    <li> I use this as a night cream under night moisturizing cream.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little strong.</li>
    <li> Great face cream! Been using for a couple of weeks and my face looks more clear with lines less noticeable. It is a bit thick and made with oils, and I am sensitive to breakouts and this does not break me out. It does have a strong but not unpleasant smell that fades quickly. I use an all day wear foundation that keeps the cream from making my face look oily. I use it at night and during the day. I love it!</li>
    <li> The cream is very thick as others have stated, but my skin appears much more vibrant. Hasn&#x27;t taken away any forehead wrinkles, but I do recommend this cream. My skin looks healthy and has a glow. Hopefully with another month of use. Will improve even more.</li>
    <li> read the ingredients and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how they can sell it for such a low price. the amount of medicinal herbs(whildcrafted or organic) is unbelievable.i have very dry skin so i use my oils first (argan, rosehip, avocado) and then put this on top to seal the moisture in. it has a thick consistency, green color, faint natural smell of olive oil and herbs.&lt;br /&gt;i will keep buying it as long as they keep making it. It is very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: extra virgin olive oil, wheat germ oil, vit E, aloe vera, white oak bark, comfrey root, marshmallow root, mullein leaf, black walnut leaf, gravel root, wormwood herb, lobelia herb, scullcap herb, gardenia oil, lemon oil, beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;Made in usa!</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing I have found to make me look younger. It has smoothed out my face. I love it.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD DELIVERY.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using his bone and tissue repair for about 10 years now and when I found this I thought what a great companion product to go with the bone and tissue and it works amazing! My in law has very thin skin and my dogs always get her one way or another and the bone and tissue has her healed up in no time so I bought this for our faces hoping it would do the same 😊 and we love it! I had my mom use it and now she&#x27;s a fan too. We live in Utah up in the mountains and its dry so the extra moisture is much appreciated. It is anhydrous so it&#x27;s not like any face cream you&#x27;ve probably tried before it&#x27;s very thick and creamy very moisturizing so if you have oily skin you only need a bit! But I think all skin types ages you name it would benefit from this product. I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural as is all his products and will continue to buy, this is my fourth jar and I&#x27;d say if you use it everyday like we do that one jar would probably last a month or two depending on skin type. Like I said mine is kind of dry and also 42 years young😜! It also smells good although we love that earthy smell it&#x27;s by no means overpowering but definitely a distinct earthy smell due to all the herbs in it. I have been making my own lotions and anti aging potions and this is a wonderful addition especially when I don&#x27;t have time to make my own. I hope this has been helpful I&#x27;ve only written one review before so I&#x27;m not sure if I covered everything but just in case I didn&#x27;t make it clear 3 of us aged 42 thru 68 love this product and keep buying every time we&#x27;re close to running out!</li>
    <li> it arrived quickly and it smells not bad,  i have to use it at night becasue the smell wears out by morning and it does leave my skin soft the next day so, i will buy more after i finish the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS CREAM FOR MY SKIN AND I STORE IN A COOL PLACE, MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER FOUND IT AND SHE LOVES IT...IT REALLY IMPROVES YOUR SKIN...</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me and very heavy and thick, seemed to mostly be maybe the beeswax.  just sat on skin, didn&#x27;t sink in</li>
    <li> cannot go wrong with any product from this line...I love the cream and know I so trust this brand, the prices are outrageously&lt;br /&gt;reasonable and so holistic, it is a no brainer.....this stuff should  be in every retailer in the country...</li>
    <li> HHS one amazing thing I will pass on about this cream is how it took care of some under the surface lumps on my skin, Dr. Would not remove these lumps because she said the result would be worse than the lumps. The lumps multiplied and I was fearing a witch like skin in my older years. I got the cream to help with wrinkles but was so excited to see the lumps diminish and two of them vanish, I just have this one huge lump that is getting smaller and smaller. Wooohooo!</li>
    <li> Having sensitive skin and numerous allergies to synthetic products, I am a bit limited with options for skin care products. Upon applying this appears thick but is absorbed quickly. I love the pleasant smell and the natural ingredients were exactly what I was seeking. My skin loves this too!</li>
    <li> My original review said this was a solid oil, not a cream, but as I used more of the product I realized there was just a layer of solid oil on top.  The product is actually a very rich cream.  I love the way it smells - natural and herbal-ly. I am only using it under my eyes right now and some on my hands.  I have acne issues so after I work up the nerve to use it all over my face I will update the review.</li>
    <li> I hate to give a bad review but this is my experience.  It smells really bad and is very greasy.  A waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a beauty facial product that moisturizes the face and an anti wrinkle cream all in one. When I first used this on my face it had a greasy feel to it; I have pimple and blackhead problems so I was worried at first if it would have me break out more, but I was wrong. It actually reduces pimples and blackheads! Not only that after using it for about a week before going to bed my face looked like it was glowing. A beauty product made out of organic herbs? No other beauty product beasts the all natural Dr. Christoper&#x27;s formula! Recommend to anybody who wants a healthy glow to their skin.</li>
    <li> I could see a difference after the first use. Have been using it over a week now and my skin looks and feels beautiful. It&#x27;s even working on my brow and lashes. They seem to be getting thicker &amp; at 64 I needed all the help I could get.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s pretty choosy about things like bath salts, skin lotions, etc. OK, she&#x27;s not pretty choosy, she&#x27;s very choosy. I mention it because she&#x27;s thrilled with this product - it&#x27;s clean, silky and helps her skin as opposed to a lot of things she&#x27;s tried (mostly she&#x27;s given up trying new skin/face cream products, they all seem to be the same and or ridiculously over-priced) that cause blotches and/or breakouts. A high-quality, cool and refreshing cream in a convenient package and size. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Product does what it states</li>
    <li> Love this cream, and the order was fulfilled quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it three nights and on the fourth day I noticed my skin was smoother and fresh looking. The smell is ok. I haven&#x27;t noticed it on my pillow but I change my sheets and pillow cases each week and pillow cases as often as needed but like I said I have not noticed it on my pillow case.  I use many expensive products and have&#x27;nt really seen a remarkable  difference as I had when I looked in the mirror this morning.  I will keep using it for night time.  I have very young looking skin for my age and now that I am nearing 60 thought to get something a bit heavier for night time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a older women,( 0ver 65) and now My face is breaking out! Go figure!  Most creams, I break out from , but  this one is clearing up my face!  I&#x27;m very impressed.    It has a little smell to it , but it goes away fast., and you do not need to use much.   This should last a Long time.     I still use my wrinkle cream over this, although this seems oily at first.</li>
    <li> This product is heavily scented, to the extreme. I can&#x27;t even think of putting it on my face, I&#x27;d be sneezing too badly.  Also, it&#x27;s very heavy which may be good for a night cream, but again, I can&#x27;t get past the scent. It&#x27;s a nice gardenia scent, but way, way too much.  Having said that, I&#x27;ve been using it on my cuticles and the results have been excellent.  No more little pieces of dry skin splintering off and the cuticles are healthy looking and not dry.  I keep coming back to using the cream for that.  Also a little bit goes a long, long way, so this jar will last quite a while.  The label says to keep refrigerated for long term freshness, so I scooped out a little bit and put in a small extra jar by my nightstand for convenience, and put the original jar in the fridge to avoid it turning rancid, as fresh oils will do. Hey, it&#x27;s a natural product.  I make my own lotions on occasion, so I&#x27;m used to this, no biggy.  I would give it 5 stars but for the scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream a couple of weeks ago and have been using at night before bed. It is thick and made of olive oil so I was afraid it would clog my pores. I have super sensitive skin. I washed my face first with Neutrogena Pore Purifying Scrub. Then I crossed my fingers and put it on, then went over my face gently to wipe excess off. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good but with time I am getting use to it. To my SURPRISE, it isn&#x27;t clogging my pores! Also, I had one very bad area with the hard white head, like a grain of sand in my skin I could not get out without digging and making a big sore.  Immediately, I noticed it beginning to come out. In a couple days I could gently use my fingernail, I know nasty, and it flicked right away. I also did make a small sore area elsewhere doing the same thing. I took this cream and rubbed in into the scraped area and it is still there but is quickly began healing much better than using other products I have used. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to try and to my excitement I am very happy with this product. It says to use more but I only use at bedtime and in the morning I gently rub into any breakout area I have. Just this moment I only have one breakout area instead of 8 so I am very PLEASED! THANK YOU DR. CHRISTOPHER - I DESERVE A KICKBACK AS I KNOW THIS WILL BOOST YOUR SALES but I AM A HARD SALE AND THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS. Hopes this helps someone - It did me. :o)(UPDATE) I had requested a referral to go to a dermatologist and it came in the mail yesterday - but the thing is MY FACE IS CLEAR! Yes, that stinky cream is doing the job! I even rub it over my eyelids and every time I put anything on eyelids I would break out they are so sensitive. No more I have a new cream for life unless they change the ingredients. I have had that happen before and pray this doesn&#x27;t happen with this facial cream. Have a good Day!</li>
    <li> Just a little bit goes a very long way.  I use it on my face as well as my hands.  Best beauty cream ever.</li>
    <li> Another Dr. Christopher&#x27;s great product!  My favorite facial cream now---use it before and after shave, you will get great results!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This cream is thick, and I thought It would be greasy for my &amp;#34;very sensitive&amp;#34; skin, but this is one of the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  For daytime use, mix it with a serum to thin it out.&lt;br /&gt;It also gets rid of pimples!</li>
    <li> Thick and sticky.  Hard to wash off.  Comes off on clothing/pillows, etc.  Sticky mess on hands and face.  Just not the money.</li>
    <li> This is the first herbal facial creme I have ever used and believe me I have tried them all  being a cosmetic junkie I have bought my fair share of facial products-THIS ONE IS THE VERY BEST HANDS DOWN!!!  the smell is herbal not too strong- and the ointment is somewhat rich, I use it at night and by morning it has sank all the way into the skin and moisturized the tissue- I love all Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products- they do what they say they do- from the other reviews that I read some said to cut the ointment with a light creme or gel to thin it out for day use- so I cut it with some witch hazel because the temperature rose to 30 degrees today which was warm considering we&#x27;ve been between 0-15 degrees for the last week- well when I washed the makeup off my skin was a tad bit dry because of the witch hazel, but I have been using Vitamin E gel by CoCo Care to cut it with and it did just fine- my skin is oily in the summer so I will wait to try the witch hazel-because I do intend to use this ointment year round.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I always had dry skin and nothing helped this product is the answer!  It has strong smell but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have uneven skin type on my face. My cheeks are very dry so I only use it on the two dry spots. I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy feeling right after you use it. I use it both at night and day after I washed my face.  I use it as base before I apply make up in the morning too. Really like the product.</li>
    <li> My mom used to work for Nature&#x27;s way and has been using Christopher&#x27;s Bone and Tissue ointment (which used to be called Bone, Flesh &amp; Cartilage, I believe) on her face since the 90&#x27;s. She is now in her mid-60&#x27;s and she does not have a single wrinkle, which is a wonder because she grew up in Hawaii and has had her fair share of sun exposure. I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and am starting to see fine lines and expression wrinkles so I decided to start using it myself and was pleased to find that there is a formulation specifically for the face. It has a lot of the same ingredients as the Bone formula that my mom used but it actually smells better. It does take a while to soak in but that and the smell will be well worth it if I have the same results as my mom!</li>
    <li> On the bottle it says to apply it at least 6 times a day, which is totally ridiculous. It smells pretty alright, and feels good. Nothing spectacular, but a decent buy!</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream I have very dry skin and it moisturized very well. I used it about 7 times throughout the day and I never got clogged pores. I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> The descriptions by other reviewers are accurate, in that it is quite emollient in nature, like a thick lubricant, with a fragrance of olive oil and flax oil--which to me smells like turpentine. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but not pleasant to me either. I only used this on my face a few times and decided I prefer my usual products (Skin Biology and Yonka). Instead, I used it on my hands, putting them in a baggie and wrapping them with a heating pad, then rubbing the excess on my arms and legs afterwards. I had to top it with a fragrance lotion though, to mask the odor. It&#x27;s obviously a good buy, if you like the product. I won&#x27;t get it again because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This cream was too heavy to soak in when applied to my face, and I felt like it would just rub off on my pillow even though I have extremely dry skin. It did, however, work pretty well as a moisturizer for my calves which normal body lotions are totally ineffective on.</li>
    <li> I knew when I ordered this product that it might have too much oil for me and that turned out to be the case.  This might be ideal for someone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is really great, only thing it is really sticky so it is only useful for night cream for me.. It seems to make small lines disappear.</li>
    <li> Great cream for dry skin.  It is somewhat greasy, but my skin is dry and it soaks it up.  I love the smell, its floral/ herbal.  I have never broken out from this and my skin is very sensitive.  I love that I know what all the ingredients are, no crazy chemicals.  When I use this it almost feels like it is healing my skin.  I am a big fan of many dr. Christophers formulas.  Quality products at affordable prices.  I am already on my second jar.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for healing areas of skin that are having issues or using it on acne.  The cream is very thick and rich.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite creams just seems to melt away the wrinkles.  Large bottle that goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  my skin is better!</li>
    <li> The smell is a little different, but the way it makes my face feel is fantastic!  I original purchased the regular product, and notice that several blotches that I had on my body just vanished before I even knew they were gone. It also healed my eczema rash and the discoloration left from my unfortunate scratching.  When I say that, and how beautifully supple it left my skin on my hands, I was sold.  My sister orginally told me about this creme, and it beats anything on the market, especially those medicated creams that only do more harm than good.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this  product for a few  years. It moisturizes my skin very well and all of the ingrediants are natural.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cream.  I use it at night only after I&#x27;ve washed my face.  My skin is smooth and soft in the morning.  I used to have this patch of redness/blackheads by my ear and that has gone away significantly.  For the price and the quality of the ingredients, using this cream is a no brainer!</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome, it has so many ingredients that are proven to help aging skin and scars. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> firstly its a really really good mosturizer, and it sinks into the skin fast, which I like as its rich but not too oily. It also surprised me after using it for a few weeks I noticed my skin had a significantly healthy glow... the herbs in this formula really feed the skin as well as moisturize it. I also noticed its been helping heal up some old acne scarring on my face. this is affordable and an awesome cream. I&#x27;ll be a regular customer for shure as we cant buy this in Australia, I appreciate the fast and easy service of online shopping Ive experienced buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products over the years for dry skin.  Living in a dry climate makes the problem worse. Nothing I have ever used has helped my skin as much as this product.  Yes, it is a bit smelly and greasy when first put on but it gets absorbed within a short period of time and now I would not live without it.  No problem with skin irritation either.  Very good!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this cream, especially because it has all very natural ingredients. But I almost gagged after putting it on my face! The smell is so strong, I got a headache from it! it smells like that typical, very strong old lady perfume! You may like that but my husband won&#x27;t come near me when I have it on. I won&#x27;t be able to use it long enough to see any results. Please make this unscented!</li>
    <li> I use it daily and like enough to order again.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every natural face cream out there and this is by far one of my favorites! This is one I use daily!</li>
    <li> Very greasy and shiny and does NOT help for wrinkles.  I Ws not impressed at all..</li>
    <li> Omg this is awesome. No winter dryness and I feel like it is making my skin better. Packs a punch and its so cheap.</li>
    <li> Truly moisturizes- better than most products out there and at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Yes, as some reviewers have stated, this cream has a thick, sticky consistency but my skin eats it up -as if it&#x27;s thirsty.  I have combination skin, and I find this to cream to be very balancing.  I usually wake up in the mornings to an oily T-zone with other beauty moisturizers.  I apply it at bedtime, and by morning my face looks evenly moisturized and dewey.  No Shine whatsoever...only a very healthy glow!  I have finally found my last and final moisturizer for life!!!  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.  Thanks Dr Christopher!...God Bless His Soul!</li>
    <li> This is all I use now, does get a bit oily feeling but it does absorbs.  Skins feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this cream, but it simply just did not work for my skin type. It broke me out all over my face so I will be passing it on to someone else.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and it is really nice! It&#x27;s not really for the daytime as it is pretty thick and greasy but I can tell it will do great things for my skin when worn overnight. It has gardenia so it smells luscious. It reminds me of cold cream. Like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Over the past few years, to my dismay, I&#x27;ve been noticing some broken capillaries on my cheeks, including a red bump that never really went away, no matter what products I used. So the reviewer who said it made her facial blemishes go away caught my attention. In addition, I have extremely dry skin and have been consistently disappointed by so many over the counter face creams. The only thing that has ever made a difference was an extremely expensive face cream that Arbonne makes ($90 - yikes!), and though my husband has offered to pay for it if it would make me happy and work for me, I didn&#x27;t feel right having him spend that kind of money.&lt;br /&gt;And then I stumbled on Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products and this one for the face cream. It came and I was so excited to try it, really hoping it would work for me, too. My husband can&#x27;t smell anything so was blissfully unaware of the strong herbal smell, but my daughter sure noticed when I would put it on and would always ask, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34;. It does take some getting used to, but this is a fantastic cream. I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not make it red and irritated like so many others have. It&#x27;s so moisturizing and just as the other reviewer said, leaves you skin so soft in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night before bed and in the morning before putting on my make-up (makes it go on so much better) and leaves a nice glow to my skin with mineral foundation applied over it. Many people have commented that my skin looks so healthy. What a difference it is making - especially in the dry winter air.&lt;br /&gt;Also, since applying over the last 3 weeks, the red bump has gone down a lot. It was very raised and noticeable and now has shrunk down to the size of a pin. I have finally found something that works! Thank you for putting out a great product. I never write reviews, but finding something that actually does what it claims to and is affordable AND has no harmful chemicals is worth taking the time to review!&lt;br /&gt;If you also have very dry skin, this is an excellent face cream.!&lt;br /&gt;If you also have very dry skin, this is an excellent face cream.</li>
    <li> I threw the jar away as the smell was too foul to put on my face</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It is anti-aging and super for dry skin!</li>
