      <li>so i would say more 24 hours at best.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, not overpowering smell - just &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sadly, the good scent covered up an inability to function as an antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>It is priced fairly for the quality of product as well.  </li>
      <li>I will not dispute that, but I can&#x27;t in good faith call this an antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Good stuff here.  </li>
      <li>it works good and smells good....</li>
      <li>It product does really good.</li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t all that good.</li>

      <li>so he was not overly thrilled when this Degree Aerosol showed up on his side of the sink.  </li>
      <li>Nice spray.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the can is quite nice and streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Okay for a spray....but not as good a &amp;#34;body feel&amp;#34; as with</li>
      <li>(I just wish my own junk had that nifty locking ring.</li>
      <li>The nifty design of the container means there is no lid which is a nice feature.</li>
      <li>I liked the smell of this antiperspirant a lot.  </li>
      <li>It smells really good, &amp; so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>, I would never keep this in a car to use- when it sprays it is very strong.  </li>
      <li>I love the woodsy smell and would love for my hubby to smell like that all the time!</li>
      <li>son liked the scent better than I did and will finish out the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no crazy great smell it gives off, but that&#x27;s just fine with me.</li>
      <li>I am glad I take a shower in the AM and PM.  </li>
      <li>It has a refreshing scent to it.  </li>
      <li>Are you a person that needs an antiperspirant that will get you going for the month or even a weekend and want to make sure it</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>- many leave me with a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I know it works better than the Degree sticks I was using.</li>
      <li>While I love the roll on stick degree, I stay away from this one.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m better off trimming that area.</li>
      <li>If you like spray deodorant and don&#x27;t mind the scent, I think you&#x27;d be pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It does its job and none more.</li>
      <li>A.) Twist the ring on the top of the canister to prepare it to spray.</li>
      <li>Great product, shipped well Thanks.</li>
      <li>My husband likes the spray much better than roll on</li>
      <li>there is a “ring” at the top you turn to “lock” it.  </li>
      <li>Scent is almost overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoyed the scent</li>
      <li>you are looking for excellent protection to keep from stinking all day, this definitely works!</li>
      <li>It claims to work for 48 hours, but we won&#x27;t know that for sure unless we go on a camping trip and don&#x27;t shower for a day.</li>
      <li>Furthermore it claims to be motion activated so that when you move (your arms specifically I assume) more of the stuff is activated thus masking any odor and preventing wetness.</li>
      <li>so I wont be able to give an apples to apples review.</li>
      <li>My teenager put a lot of it on to make sure I could smell it</li>
      <li>Like most aerosols I have used a lot of the product does not make it to my skin but is disbursed to the air.</li>
      <li>The marketing of this product however, is pretty good. :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;it smells great, works good, lasts long...</li>
      <li>No sweating, no staining and no stinky and it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>I like that the top of the can locks, so it is easy to take it along and not leak inside of the bag.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quite strong, reminding me a bit of the AXE line, though I do like this scent a lot better than some of those!&lt;br</li>
      <li>product does go on dry, and the antiperspirant effect is superb.</li>
      <li>well it works is the most important</li>
      <li>and I was good to go the whole day.</li>
      <li>This deodorant works very well and smells good.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product; I spray it in more locations then directed, as I sweat more than just my underarms, just use it lightly in those areas</li>
      <li>Great antiperspirant smells great and last a very long time have tried many different brands this is the best!</li>
      <li>This version uses an easy to use application that feels &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and goes on without feeling sticky or over used.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like the strong smell of it.</li>
      <li>Just too strong for him.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is fine.  </li>
      <li>The smell seemed VERY strong, at first.  </li>
      <li>an and noticed two HUGE visible stains under both arms.</li>
      <li>It also sprays in a huge cloud- all over your face.</li>
      <li>and he really doesn&#x27;t care for any kind of lingering perfume-y smell.  </li>
      <li>since this was free from the Amazon vine program, I figure I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you enjoy spraying your shameful regions from a can</li>
      <li>I got this for free through the mail.</li>
      <li>Awesome best I&#x27;ve ever used and I hate spray deodorant.</li>
      <li>works great, other flavors of the Degree spray smell better though</li>
      <li>The Degree Men&#x27;s Dry Antiperspirant Spray is a great product but it has a very mild deodorant effect.  </li>
      <li>He won&#x27;t use anything but a spray, so it&#x27;s nice that there are some new ones around to try!</li>
      <li>For the first time in three years I was able to walk to class and not be sweating.</li>
      <li>After I finish this can, I am pretty sure I will be a continuous customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the scent of this new antiperspirant by degree. It&#x27;s hard to describe but it is the right mixture of unobtrusive and reassuring for a deodorant.  Furthermore it claims to be motion activated so that when you move (your arms specifically I assume) more of the stuff is activated thus masking any odor and preventing wetness.The spray goes on dry, claims to be effective for 48 hours and this three ounce container according to the manufacturer should last six weeks.  In order to dispense this antiperspirant you first twist the lid then push the button to spray and this application process has always worked smoothly for me.</li>
    <li> I like the new dry spray idea that is hitting the market. It feels like you&#x27;re spraying air under your arms rather than deodorant, and there is no lingering wetness. The product is discharged using butane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple of these products and they are all very effective. The protection and fragrance last about two days, and works well keeping you dry, even during a workout. It remains to be seen how long one can of this will last though, especially since they are pricier than stick deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this product falls short for me though, is with the scent. It&#x27;s described as &amp;#34;Adventure&amp;#34;, with &amp;#34;a rugged, woodsy fragrance that blends clean citrus with long-lasting notes of wood and musk.&amp;#34; Geez...it sounds like a description of a wine. The fragrance reminded me more of the old Right Guard rather than being in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I liked the way this product works and recommend that you give it a try as an alternative to your regular stick deodorant. Degree offers five different fragrances from which to choose.</li>
    <li> Terrible scent from my point of view, even two hours after applying it, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think you could use this as an appetite suppressant, as I actually lost my appetite from the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended by me, however, my adult daughter (25 years old) raved about it, she thought it was sexy smelling, so I averaged our opinions for the star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;Some people will love it, others will be repelled by it, only way to find out if you like it or not is to actually try it</li>
    <li> Works. Good balance with amount of application and ease of use. The spray version is easier to apply evenly than a stick. I like that because I get sensitive to too much of an application. This version uses an easy to use application that feels &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and goes on without feeling sticky or over used. Very happy with it.  Also has a great locking mechanism for travelling,</li>
    <li> Are you a person that needs an antiperspirant that will get you going for the month or even a weekend and want to make sure it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then check out Degree Men&#x27;s MotionSense Dryspray.  An antiperspirant that provides 48H (yes...no killi killi power) and is motion activated protection.  Granted, everyone&#x27;s bodies are different but it worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antiperspirant uses Aluminum Chlorohydrate, so if you are against this active ingredient, then this antiperspirant spray is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this and I enjoyed the scent and it has kept me dry all day.  Granted, it&#x27;s the winter time but I&#x27;ll need to try it during the summer and see if this spray does well then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for those looking for a 48-hour antiperspirant spray, Degree Men DrySpray is recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this spray and has no complaints. He won&#x27;t use anything but a spray, so it&#x27;s nice that there are some new ones around to try!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my teenage son to try out&lt;br /&gt;He says the scent is crips, not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;He gave it 5 stars for effectiveness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used antiperspirant sticks instead of the sprays; but, I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works great - probably better than any of the sticks I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only downside for me is that the smell is a bit stronger than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for excellent protection to keep from stinking all day, this definitely works!</li>
    <li> Great product! I expected sticky armpits, but boy was I surprised! This spray goes on dry and really lasts throughout the day, just like a roll-on. The only caution I give is that it is easy to spray more than you need and waste it. I did this at first because I didn&#x27;t trust the product. But it was not necessary.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve probably ever used.</li>
    <li> Just give it a try..... it works good and smells good....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant stick for years now. I&#x27;ve also been replacing my dress shirts every six months because that stick leaves a yucky white residue on the inside of my shirts. After multiple washings and using Shout and everything else to get that out I always give up and buy new shirts. The last straw came last Friday. I put on a light gray dress shirt and about two hours later I was in the restroom, looked at myself in the mirror an and noticed two HUGE visible stains under both arms. I wasn&#x27;t even sweating so I knew it was the damn deodorant. Absolutely mortified I made a vow to find something better. Then I saw this product and decided to give it a whirl. A few things to note. If you&#x27;re super hairy like me then you may want to trim your underarm hair. That&#x27;s where the majority of stink comes from anyway. And with my arms up I look like an orangutan so I&#x27;m better off trimming that area. I woke up, gave my underarms a few blasts and I was good to go the whole day. No sweating, no staining and no stinky and it smells pretty good. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome body spray. I like the dryspray system. The scents are very good too.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells nearly as badly as the Axe body sprays… test them out within your local grocery. :)  The efficacy of this deodorant is lackluster, at best. I will not purchase another bottle.  The marketing of this product however, is pretty good. :)</li>
    <li> Hubby has been using Old Spice stick deodorant for his entire adult life so he was not overly thrilled when this Degree Aerosol showed up on his side of the sink.  He reluctantly agreed to give it a try.  He reported that it did indeed go on dry, unlike the Old Spice which is sticky for the first few minutes after application.  He did not like the scent, however.  Not that it is unpleasant, mind you.  Just too strong for him.  He said he could smell it throughout the day and he really doesn&#x27;t care for any kind of lingering perfume-y smell.  As far as it&#x27;s effectiveness, it seemed comparable to the Old Spice but since he doesn&#x27;t sweat as much in the dead of winter, it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do give them kudos for the design of the spray can.  The cap is built in rather than removable.  You twist it to unlock and twist it back to close.  There is nothing to get lost or fall off.  This design makes it ideal to throw in a gym bag.  If you like spray deodorant and don&#x27;t mind the scent, I think you&#x27;d be pleased with this product.  I just wish they offered an unscented version.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my college student son to use and he likes it.  He says the effectiveness is the same if not better than most spray antiperspirants (he usually uses AXE products).  It definitely has a scent but to my nose at least it is a strong and masculine one.  It is priced fairly for the quality of product as well.  The nifty design of the container means there is no lid which is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy spraying your shameful regions from a can that&#x27;s suspiciously suggestive of an erect phallus -- as I do -- this product should have built-in appeal. Unfortunately, this particular phallus fails to rise to the occasion. (I just wish my own junk had that nifty locking ring. Now that would solve a lot of problems...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does go on dry, and the antiperspirant effect is superb. However, there is no deodorant effect, nor is any claimed, at least for the Extreme version that I&#x27;m using. I&#x27;ve discovered that you can be bone-dry all day and still end up emitting a righteous manly stench. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this product doesn&#x27;t claim to be a deodorant, I wouldn&#x27;t really complain were it not for drawback #2: the vapors emitted from the phallus-can are so noxious that you literally can&#x27;t stay in the same room after spraying your armpits. I have in fact been tear gassed (don&#x27;t ask), and the effect is remarkably similar: a dry, noninflammatory irritation that causes coughing and makes it hard to breathe. I&#x27;m the last person in the world to complain about &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; (would I be buying such a product if I were?), but this stuff is far more lethal than the average spray deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I do feel a certain manly pride each day after having survived the assault. But in the end, I just want this war to be over.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the strong smell of it.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell of this antiperspirant a lot.  My teenager put a lot of it on to make sure I could smell it and I thanked him especially for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the smell was it did not have the harsh chemical smell covered up by lurid harsh scents.  (Bad, Axe, bad.)  This one had a little orange and a little wood scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the good scent covered up an inability to function as an antiperspirant.  He was at a crowded concert in Detroit that night and said that feeling sweaty really made him feel terrible.</li>
    <li> I usually avoid Antiperspirants in general.  Deodorant is definitely needed but the antiperspirant part of the equation tends to have chemicals that are not necessarily good for your body during regular use.  Normally a little bit of sweat is a good thing but there are some situations where you absolutely need to stay dry.  The Degree Men&#x27;s Dry Antiperspirant Spray is a great product but it has a very mild deodorant effect.  It is easy to apply and goes on dry so it wont ruin your clothes.  The smell is very pleasant but it fades away too quickly.  This is great if you want to wear cologne and don&#x27;t want your antiperspirant to interfere with the scent.  One other  feature worth commenting on is that the can has a twist lock instead of a cap.  This makes it perfect for travel since it wont accidentally get sprayed while in your suitcase (trust me this has happened before!!!).</li>
    <li> While I love the roll on stick degree, I stay away from this one. In just a few hours I was sweating through my shirts. Even after a prolonged week trail, it couldn&#x27;t keep up. It also sprays in a huge cloud- all over your face. Not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Bought a 3 pack of this a Sam&#x27;s Club. It smells like the 80&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, buy it all the time and works great..</li>
    <li> it works fine, but it puts a lot of fumes in the whole bathroom. Wife made me throw it away. 😆</li>
    <li> I love it.  Lasted longer than roll on deodorant.</li>
    <li> The scent is absolutely overwhelming and lingers in the bathroom long after I&#x27;ve applied it. It does go on somewhat dry, but to call it really dry is only marketing magic. I simply can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome best I&#x27;ve ever used and I hate spray deodorant. I started using this and never went back to stick. Feels great and really does go on dry.</li>

    <li> I picked this up the other day at the grocery store; I have hyperhydrosis; basically I sweat A LOT more then normal people do. I have been trying for years to find an antiperspirant that works; I finally found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on before bed and after my morning shower; I spray it on again. For the first time in three years I was able to walk to class and not be sweating. This is a fantastic product; I spray it in more locations then directed, as I sweat more than just my underarms, just use it lightly in those areas and you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing to finally be dry, if you suffer from excessive sweating you should give it a shot! It actually has the same ingredients as more expensive prescription anti perspirants and it works. I hope it continues to work; usually once my body gets used to a new anti perspirant  - it stops working but I guess we will see!</li>
    <li> Good stuff here.  Nice spray.  Keeps you dry</li>
    <li> Stinks!  Smells like a over perfumed person in an elevator - you know what I mean!  I tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great antiperspirant smells great and last a very long time have tried many different brands this is the best!</li>
    <li> So far this has been outstanding and pretty accurate in its 48 hour claim.  The can has a lock on it which is great because my kids won&#x27;t accidentally spray themselves as long as I remember to lock it.  It is a dryer spray than what I have experienced in the past.  This is nice as it doesn&#x27;t leave extra moisture under the arms.  It has a refreshing scent to it.  It is not overbearing but I can definitely smell it when it kicks in.  It does seem to have the ability to sense when I am getting extra stinky because it overpowers the sweat smell that I usually generate.  I have a tendency to develop a tolerance for deodorants so I will make an addendum if this fails but right now I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite deodorant which does not leave stains on my shirts and protect me from body odor all day. I love it. I recommended it to a friend but he got a rash so beware. I have not encountered this issue so I will keep recommending it</li>
    <li> A few months ago, Degree had a promotion where they sent out full size samples of this product so folks could try it for free.  I was very impressed with all aspects of this antiperspirant.  It truly goes on dry, the scent is pleasant (but not overpowering), and it lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to purchase this product here on Amazon based on my experiences with it.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped well Thanks.</li>
    <li> works great, other flavors of the Degree spray smell better though</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Goes on dry and does not cake up. Smells great and keeps me dry. Best antiperspirant I have ever used.</li>
    <li> awful smell.  very strong smelling, and long lasting.  i hate it.  used once and thrown away!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a month now and find it to be very effective.  It has a pleasant, not overpowering smell - just &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.  After about 30 seconds, I can put a T-shirt on without picking up those annoying white powder residues along the side of the shirt.  This antiperspirant spray does what it claims... I don&#x27;t have any noticeable odor for the 20 odd hours before showering and re-applying.  It even stops me from smelling up those new age shirts I wear under body armor... That alone, makes this a win!!  After I finish this can, I am pretty sure I will be a continuous customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay</li>
    <li> Took me a couple days to get used to the switch mechanism and knowing when it was closed or open. I like the smell, it is definitely a scent suited for men. I dont know about the 48hour claim, it was getting pretty weak in smell for me towards the end of my day so i would say more 24 hours at best. Still, it works and keeps me from smelling bad so i can recommend it.</li>
    <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t use spray Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant since I feel they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but since this was free from the Amazon vine program, I figure I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree proved me wrong with this one. It&#x27;s been 20+ hours since I applied it and it&#x27;s still working, which is something that doesn&#x27;t usually happen for me with spray anti-perspirant/deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smells great, works good, lasts long... just about everything I expect in a stick and don&#x27;t normally expect in a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> My husband likes this antiperspirant very well. He usually uses a solid, so this was different for him. He said it sprays out quite abundantly, so you have to be careful. He really likes the fragrance and so do I. The shape of the can is quite nice and streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby works in construction and this antiperspirant keeps him smelling fresh and clean all day. It goes on dry and leaves no white residue. He likes it a lot, so we will most likely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> You have to spray this further than other brands which uses much more and makes huge dust clouds. The reason is because if you spray too close you get white chunks under your pits. This doesn&#x27;t happen with the men&#x27;s dove version. The one big difference with this brand is the higher content at aluminum at 23%, whereas the dove is 20%. I&#x27;ll take the latter because I don&#x27;t like the white ball chunks degree makes.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a not too masculine scent that is very strong. Feels cold going on but dries very quickly. Like most aerosols I have used a lot of the product does not make it to my skin but is disbursed to the air. The can has a clever design that makes it easy to lock the can to prevent accidental sprays while traveling.</li>
    <li> Actually both my husband and I gave this product a try. I love the woodsy smell and would love for my hubby to smell like that all the time! But the scent is definitely masculine, so I can&#x27;t imagine using this for myself on a regular basis. This product sprayed on dry and worked really well as an antiperspirant/deodorant. It claims to work for 48 hours, but we won&#x27;t know that for sure unless we go on a camping trip and don&#x27;t shower for a day. I would recommend this and hope my hubby continues to use it.</li>
    <li> Scent is almost overwhelming.  Not subtle.  Maybe better for teens with bad body odor.</li>
    <li> Works well, but the can doesn&#x27;t last very long. Has a nice smell, but not sure I like breathing all the fumes.</li>
    <li> I have Degree dry stick antiperspirant for many years until recently.  I switched to an extra dry antiperspirant because I sweat quite easily and nothing irritates me more than sweating in my clothes or residue from antiperspirant.  This Degree not only comes in a contemporary spray can that includes a lock feature, but is easily applied without waste.  Anti-Eco friendly aside I will give the cans effectiveness and results a big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is very masculine.  I like the fragrance a great deal.  It&#x27;s manly but fairly natural and is a green/woods scent with perhaps a bit of spice.  My guys like it too.  My teen son really likes it.  It isn&#x27;t subtle- it&#x27;s quite strong, reminding me a bit of the AXE line, though I do like this scent a lot better than some of those!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a lid- the top of the can is a very neat design that twists open and shut.  It looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on like a extremely fine mist of dry oil, and feels dry going on  . There&#x27;s NO white residue.  It feels quite cool going on.  It works as an antiperspirant and a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s effective for keeping underarm odor and sweating down.  It says it is a 48 hour deodorant.  It does work all day and night for sure, but I can&#x27;t say if it actually will last for 2 days or not because we always shower before that time period is up.  That&#x27;s really nice though - especially for teen boys that are new to having to wear deodorants and are apt to forget sometimes.  (And it&#x27;s no fun to get in a car with them when they are sweaty and have forgot THAT.)&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I would never keep this in a car to use- when it sprays it is very strong.  Also the can says to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t get to hot or around flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/26/2016  My son continues to ask for this when he is out, and likes to use it.</li>
    <li> I was generally excited to use this product because I&#x27;ve been using stick deodorant for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a few things that make the product dislikable.  The first thing I want to start off with, is that for whatever reason, this deodorant does NOT last 48 hours as stated on the can. In fact, with the results I&#x27;m getting, it won&#x27;t even last longer than around 6 hours for me. The smell isn&#x27;t strong unless you really wait for the smell to enter your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I find with this product is when you spray it in the first place. It creates the absolute BIGGEST cloud of the spray and will definitely make you cough. It has such a strong cloud after spraying, and it enters your mouth and isn&#x27;t pleasing when in the cloud, so I generally use it in the bathroom, hold my breath, and walk out of the cloud. This is probably the biggest, and most irritating problem of this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the last reason why I would stay away from this deodorant is because it flakes sometimes. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll spray it, and put on my shirt only to find it it&#x27;s flaked and now there&#x27;s chunks of deodorant on my armpit hair. Yes, I do shake it before use, and this also means if you&#x27;re in a hurry, and you apply it then go, there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll need to get a napkin and remove the chunks of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this deodorant is not something I&#x27;d recommend when using it on a daily basis, or ever. I would definitely not buy this product again from all the problems that arise while using it. It also does not prevent wetness really, I&#x27;ve been sweating around the same amount just like if I ever to not even use it.</li>
    <li> I cant remember ever using a spray on product before this so I wont be able to give an apples to apples review. However  for the past year + I have been using the stick version of  Degree antiperspirant . I kept on using it that long mostly because it works.....partially that I bought a 20 pack of them at a warehouse store and it takes a while to go through that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt anyone who uses a spray goes through this but I went through a bit of experimenting how much to use to get the job done. The can does have a safety lock on it. Small &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; about them not putting the lock,/unlock indicator on the plastic safety ring itself but its printed on the can itself. Unless your taking the can on the road I don&#x27;t think the safety is needed because you have to press fairly hard to get it to spray so the odds of it going off on accident are fairly slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent but I really only smell it during and right after spraying then it hardly smells. I will probably try one of the other scents next time. I have no idea how lo0ng this 3.8oz can will last. It does dry quickly after spraying, after I put it on its already dry by the time I get my shirt on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well it works is the most important and I know it works better than the Degree sticks I was using. Not sure if that&#x27;s due to better application of the spray than the stick or if they tweaked their formula a little...my guess is that its a little of both. They claim its two days of protection. I&#x27;ve pushed that out to around 3 days and all I found out is that it wont last 3 days! I guess the 2 day claim is totally believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this delivers everything I want in an deodorant/antiperspirant. I&#x27;m a convert to the spray application. So since the product delivers everything they promise its  a very solid 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Okay for a spray....but not as good a &amp;#34;body feel&amp;#34; as with a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was not masculine enough to suit me, but was not wimpy either in all fairness.</li>
    <li> I like it when my husband uses this spray, it lasts for a long time, and he comes home smelling fresh and clean. The spray feels dry on the skin on contact. I like that the top of the can locks, so it is easy to take it along and not leak inside of the bag. And there is no lid to get lost.</li>
    <li> This Degree Spray Antiperspirant works well at controlling odor and reducing sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son liked the scent better than I did and will finish out the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I have used the Degree bar religiously through multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.  Great product...go to, like Gold Bond.  I have tried this one, figuring the same value would be delivered. No bueno..as we say where I&#x27;m from.  Straight up, I stink at the less than 16 hour point. I am glad I take a shower in the AM and PM.  Going back to the bar, hate smelling bad....</li>
    <li> It does its job and none more. I haven&#x27;t sweat or smelt anything on myself since I put it on. There&#x27;s no crazy great smell it gives off, but that&#x27;s just fine with me. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Nice to get this delivered regularly. My husband likes the spray much better than roll on</li>
    <li> It certainly has a scent and goes on dry. I will not dispute that, but I can&#x27;t in good faith call this an antiperspirant. In less than 2 hours of using it I am sweating through a shirt at a ludicrous rate, and I am doing nothing but sit at a desk. I wish this could replace the gel deoderants I use, but it can&#x27;t seem to slow down the sweating other deoderants handle.</li>
    <li> Got a sample in the mail, which is the exact size as the store bought. It smells really good, &amp; so easy to apply. I got it for my husband, &amp; he likes it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as advertized. No fuss no bother</li>
    <li> Degree Men Dry Spray Antiperspirant is an excellent product overall.  Along with AXE White Label Dry Spray, it is one of my deodorant / antiperspirant products of choice.  Compared to conventional stick or gel deodorant / antiperspirant products, Degree&#x27;s Dry Spray is easily applied, is effective for a long time, and does not leave white marks on shirts.  For these reasons, I have switched over to dry spray products.  In terms of this product specifically, the Adventure scent in particular is very appealing, albeit a little sporty, but not overwhelmingly so.  Overall, I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works very well and smells good.  It hasn&#x27;t left any kind of residue on my clothing.  I also appreciate the locking ring which prevents accidental spraying as I travel a lot and some things tend to leak or spray in a travel bag.</li>
    <li> A.) Twist the ring on the top of the canister to prepare it to spray. When in the locked position, nothing will come out. This is excellent for hiking, traveling, etc. (There will never be that moment that your deodorant leaked all over your clothes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.) It truly does dry instantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.) The smell seemed VERY strong, at first.  In the first few seconds, I thought it was truly overwhelming. Then, it seemed to almost instantly become much lighter. However, do know that there is still a moderate to strong scent. (That might be exactly what you are seeking ... and it might not be an option if one or one&#x27;s partner is sensitive to fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D.) Works great!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Degree solid for years and years.  Though I’ve used different spray brands in the past, I never really liked them too much because they would often stain my clothing.  So far that hasn’t been the case with Degree spray.  It goes on dry. . . . and keeps me dry.  The fragrance is fine.  A little “bold” but not overpowering.  I don’t smell it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY like the can.  That’s kind of an “odd” comment but the main reason is that there is no cap. . . but. . . there is a “ring” at the top you turn to “lock” it.  The “ring” will click, so you know that it’s locked.  That’s great for putting it in your gym bag and traveling.  A VERY nice feature, if you ask me.  Also, I like the look of the can.  I know that the look has nothing to do with what’s inside, but it has a “snazzy” look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about the spray is the “cloud” it creates when you use it.  I think that’s just because I haven’t used spray antiperspirant in so long and have forgotten about that part.</li>
    <li> This has the most unique design I&#x27;ve seen in a long time - the lock and button look like something you&#x27;d find on a can of mace! There&#x27;s a twist lock and rubber coated spray button, so it can&#x27;t slip, even when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray has a lot of volume - a couple of short sprays is all it takes per pit. There&#x27;s lots of over-spray - unavoidable with aerosols. I have pretty sensitive under-arms, but this spray did not bother me - many leave me with a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is typical what I call &amp;#34;generic spray deodorant&amp;#34; - but what&#x27;s important is that it keeps me dry!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It goes on dry and smells great and I haven&#x27;t had any wet pits yet!</li>
    <li> It product does really good. It lasts a while too. It&#x27;s sprays on dry as well. It will look invisible on your armpits if you follow the instructions. The scent isn&#x27;t all that good. I got this for free through the mail.</li>
