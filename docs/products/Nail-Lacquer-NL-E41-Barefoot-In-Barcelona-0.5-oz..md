<li> this is a good polish, but i would recommend to use a good base coat because the polish is a little thicker than normal and does streak when not used with a base coat.</li>
<li> downside is that it leaves a brown stain on your nails if you take too long to take it off</li>
<li> Like other OPI polishes, a coat or two will last a while.</li>
<li> Color too dark.</li>
<li> It takes a while getting used to because I don&#x27;t have any previous nail polishes this color.</li>
<li> oh well, it&#x27;s not worth the return!</li>
<li> i would wear it everyday if i could.</li>
<li> i gave it 4 stars because the need use a base coat.</li>

    <li> I can wear this all week...:)</li>
    <li> love it was already having my finger nails that color in the salon wanted it for my toes wonderful neutral color for spring and summer</li>
    <li> This color is great! It&#x27;s a deeper, darker nude which can be worn on any day and any occasion! Love the name too ;-)</li>
    <li> OPI is a reliable brand and this is a super color. If you have a very fair complexion this color might be too dark for you. If not, it is just great. It&#x27;s a nude/neutral, but with just enough feminine color. The seller added a personal touch that won my loyalty.</li>
    <li> Sophisticated and demure for everyday, goes with everything.  Light tan color with pink undertone.  Brushes on creamy and dries quickly.  I recommend two coats and a top coat for longevity.</li>
    <li> The shade is a bit more pink than it appears on my monitor.  A pleasant, updated shade for work. Product appears to be fresh and was delivered as anticipated.</li>
    <li> OPI is always a good product. I love this color... The polish goes on smooth &amp; drys with a shine.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves the color. OPI is the only polish I buy and this color is a softer, more neutral color. Mom loves it.</li>
    <li> i love this color! i would wear it everyday if i could. i currently own two bottles. downside is that it leaves a brown stain on your nails if you take too long to take it off</li>

    <li> this is a good polish, but i would recommend to use a good base coat because the polish is a little thicker than normal and does streak when not used with a base coat. i gave it 4 stars because the need use a base coat. would purchase again. thank you.</li>
    <li> Love OPI nail products the coverage is great and the color seems more resistant to chipping. This color was a little on the cooler/pinker side than I was expecting but still a great polish.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color nailpolish and I was thrilled to find it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> A really beautiful color that goes well with my very pale skin. I also love this this has enough color to be noticeable, but is also office-appropriate. I find that one coat is too thin, but two coats is perfect. It goes on well and is not streaky.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful color for summer and winter.</li>
    <li> The color is wonderful, no chipping, easy to apply and this color works with all skin tones.  Another hit from Opi.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s the perfect nude color for my skin tone. I also got it for a great price on this site.</li>
    <li> I like this polish. It takes a while getting used to because I don&#x27;t have any previous nail polishes this color. It should be fun to use though when my nails grow longer</li>
    <li> I had in mind something sandier and beige. It is pinker than I expected, but still nice. Nice product. It doesn&#x27;t have that strong lingering fumes that other nail polishes do.</li>
    <li> Color too dark. I will not select thist nail color again.  Other than that, the OPI nail product was excellent</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely light enough to be called nude, blends in well with my skin. My only problem with Barefoot in Barcelona is the pinky/grey undertone! I do better with autumn tones and had I known this, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased but oh well, it&#x27;s not worth the return! Over all, I still wear it, it just doesn&#x27;t make me feel as pretty. Maybe this is just a sign that I need to tan.:)</li>
    <li> Love this polish-the color looks much prettier on than when it&#x27;s in the bottle.  It&#x27;s very neutral and goes with a lot.  Like other OPI polishes, a coat or two will last a while.</li>
