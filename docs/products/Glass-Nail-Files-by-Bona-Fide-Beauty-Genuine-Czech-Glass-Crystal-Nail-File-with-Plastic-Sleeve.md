      <li>It almost doesn&#x27;t even feel like a nail file, it&#x27;s so smooth - but REALLY does the job!</li>
      <li>Beautiful and deadly.</li>
      <li>* maintains grit -- so far so good, also the grit is so smooth and not rough like others</li>
      <li>I really liked the actual design of the file.</li>
      <li>let me tell you it was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>this is not only beautiful but totally functional.</li>
      <li>First, you will notice it is really pretty, then when you try it you will be surprised at how fast it files your nails nicely.  </li>
      <li>Product shipped fast and looks just as pictured if not more beautiful.</li>
      <li>So far so good, will continue to use and evaluate overall how it holds up.  </li>
      <li>I just had my gel nails removed and look forward to doing my first &amp;#34;Perfect Manicure.&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I was more than please with the packaging of my item and especially the price I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>My 5 year old wanted to try it out and since it is so light weight and files</li>
      <li>and I feel like I have been cheated my whole life!</li>
      <li>After weeks of searching for the right brand and learning as much as I can about these files I placed my order.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice little protective sleeve so you don&#x27;t scratch precious items in your purse which if you are like me is filled with a little of everything.</li>
      <li>and it can be easily washed off unlike standard emery board files.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a sandy or gritty feeling after filing and my natural nails felt very smooth after using it.</li>
      <li>Nice little file.  </li>
      <li>Very Sturdy and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>This works really well when you apply wraps to file off the edge.</li>
      <li>This allows you to choose just how much nail you want to take off.</li>
      <li>Believe me if you have never owned a glass file, which I hadn&#x27;t, you will be grateful that you purchased this product and you will never go back to cheap flimsy nail files again.</li>
      <li>I minimized my routine to see how much of a difference this file would really have.</li>
      <li>It files my nails so smoothly without any peeling or snags like some regular files leave.</li>
      <li>It is also thicker than I imagined and feels very durable.</li>
      <li>Had a personality straight out of the package.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s about all I can really say.</li>
      <li>I love that it is small enough to put in a purse and the colors make it look stylish and modern.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t wear down after use</li>
      <li>* stylish - to be honest, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the look online</li>
      <li>So far this file is nice and seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
      <li>and I highly suggest getting one of these for your nail care routine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Immediately after examining the quality of the nail file I knew this was far better than the other glass/crystal files I&#x27;ve seen/</li>
      <li>The file is sharp, but easy to use, and does its job well</li>
      <li>But - it has surprised me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just super careful with it, being as it is made of glass</li>
      <li>The only drawback with this product is that you can loose grip if you have sweaty hands because the handle is really smooth.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from a glass nail file and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I have never used a glass file before and really don&#x27;t ever want to use something different now!  </li>
      <li>Kind of thin compared to the Nailtech glass file I had.  </li>
      <li>What I mean by nicely is it doesn&#x27;t leave frayed edges that you have to keep going back over</li>
      <li>It actually filed my nails down softly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>Easy and quick file, no more waste created by using emery board.</li>
      <li>I can now file my nails with little effort because of how fine this product is and it leaves the ends of my nails feeling so soft and no rough edges that catch onto clothes n such.</li>
      <li>And I can see it lasting for much longer than a standard nail file because it&#x27;s glass.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the best nail files I have used in a long time. Very Sturdy and gets the job done. Unlike those flimsy files that bend and break, this is superb!!</li>
    <li> Great product, high quality and would buy again</li>
    <li> this is not only beautiful but totally functional. I&#x27;ve never had a glass file before but I think it&#x27;s going to be all I buy from now on. It files my nails so smoothly without any peeling or snags like some regular files leave. My 5 year old wanted to try it out and since it is so light weight and files so nicely I went ahead and let him use it on his own, he even did my toes for me lol. I love that you&#x27;re able to wash this file so I don&#x27;t have to worry about any infections if someone else uses it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> After weeks of searching for the right brand and learning as much as I can about these files I placed my order. Immediately after examining the quality of the nail file I knew this was far better than the other glass/crystal files I&#x27;ve seen/bought before.&lt;br /&gt;Before this file: my nails were dry with ridges, split all the time, and so weak that bending was a given.&lt;br /&gt;After using this file for a month: my nails are longer than ever (thanks to no more chipping) and I don&#x27;t have to worry about snagging anymore. In this time I moisturized my nails, only filed the edges (no buffing), and applied a weekly clear coat. I minimized my routine to see how much of a difference this file would really have. In the end I&#x27;ve come out a believer and all I need now is a good nail clip (Yeah.. it&#x27;s that good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the claims/issues I was concerned about and how they held up in my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* this product won&#x27;t damage your nails if you file in both directions  -- I believe this is true but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it (old habits), however I  had some chips that were so bad I used the file to smooth the surface of that nail (something I&#x27;d never do w/ another file)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* little to none nail film/flakes -- very true, so true I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t working... and .. it was. I&#x27;d never pull out a file to fix a nail in public b/c of gross flaking and now I can&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* durable -- have not tested this yet, and although I don&#x27;t think it would shatter if it made an occasional crash landing (like others I&#x27;ve seen) - I wouldn&#x27;t want to test that theory :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* maintains grit -- so far so good, also the grit is so smooth and not rough like others I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* stylish - to be honest, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the look online but once in my hand I was sold - again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filing my nails now takes a fraction of the time it used to and chipping is no longer an issue. I also don&#x27;t have to compromise the length of my nails to getthe shape I want. The search is over!</li>
    <li> I received this at a nominal discount, but the opinions are mine alone. The file is sharp, but easy to use, and does its job well</li>
    <li> So beautiful and works amazingly!  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Nice little file.  The feel of the grit is a little weird...it kinda gets in my spine if that makes sense...lol.  I think that&#x27;s just me though.  So far this file is nice and seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
    <li> I watched &amp;#34;How to do a perfect manicure&amp;#34; and they recommended a glass nail file.  I was more than please with the packaging of my item and especially the price I paid for it.  I just had my gel nails removed and look forward to doing my first &amp;#34;Perfect Manicure.&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I cannot brag about this nail file enough! I was using a boring emery board before receiving this and I feel like I have been cheated my whole life! I never knew that a glass nail file could be such a wonderful thing. With emery boards, it is essentially shredding the end of your nail, which is why you see larger chucks of your nail come off while filing. This nail file produces very file dust which gives you a smoother tip and less damage to your nail. I use nail wraps and this has improved my technique by 1000x! My nails now look flawless thanks to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a beautiful selection of ombre colors that anyone can enjoy. The pointed tip is the smoothest part, the closer to the handle you get, the rougher it gets. This allows you to choose just how much nail you want to take off. It is also thicker than I imagined and feels very durable. Since it&#x27;s glass, it is easily disinfected as well. This has become an essential part of my manicure kit and I highly suggest getting one of these for your nail care routine.&lt;br /&gt;*Product received during a special promotional period in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> These nail files are perfect.  I have given them to my two sons, my daughter-in-law, my granddaughter and my cousin.  I love them.</li>
    <li> I have never used a glass file before and really don&#x27;t ever want to use something different now!  These files are great!  They are so comfortable to use.  I like how the sides of them don&#x27;t dig into my hand while I&#x27;m filing, like some of the metal ones I&#x27;ve used in the past!</li>
    <li> Never thought I would use a glass nail file! Love it. I got it because of all the ratings and reviews. Great purchase</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from a glass nail file and was pleasantly surprised.  First, you will notice it is really pretty, then when you try it you will be surprised at how fast it files your nails nicely.  What I mean by nicely is it doesn&#x27;t leave frayed edges that you have to keep going back over and you end up with nails shorter than you wanted.  It leaves a smooth edge very quickly and easily, what more could you want in a file? I have only had it a few days, but I always put it back in its little plastic sleeve because I am afraid I may drop it or knock it off the counter and it may break so I would advise you not to throw that away.  I would definitely buy again.  This product was received at a promotional discount for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Sweet! That&#x27;s about all I can really say. I love the colors and I love how well it works. I&#x27;m just super careful with it, being as it is made of glass and I don&#x27;t want it to ever break. It does come with a case, plastic, so it&#x27;s best to store it in a spot where it won&#x27;t get dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Just loaned this to a friend and she returned it, raving about how much she loved this nail file. She&#x27;s off to get her own now that I shared with her the link. Plus, she suggested that it would be a neat gift for Christmas. I totally agree with her. Awesome idea!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
    <li> So far so good, will continue to use and evaluate overall how it holds up.  Kind of thin compared to the Nailtech glass file I had.  But I dropped it already and it didn&#x27;t break so we will see how the finish holds up.</li>
    <li> I loved this file! Had a personality straight out of the package. Durable item</li>
    <li> Easy and quick file, no more waste created by using emery board.</li>
    <li> Just received my nail file yesterday and I have already put it to good use. Upon opening the package I examined the file and found it to be very lightweight and thinner than I actually expected it to be. I really liked the actual design of the file. I am so accustomed to having the metal nail files and emery boards with rough texture that I thought this would be no different. This nail file has a much smoother surface and provides great results. I was able to file my nails without it getting snagged like when I use a metal file and it didn&#x27;t fall apart like my emery boards would do. After filing my nails it was very easy to clean and looks brand new again. I love that it is small enough to put in a purse and the colors make it look stylish and modern.The end point is sharp and you will feel a pinch if you accidentally poke yourself however, it is not sharp enough to cut you. The only drawback with this product is that you can loose grip if you have sweaty hands because the handle is really smooth. My overall thoughts are that the product is a great investment and it is a nice replacement for emery boards or metal files. I have officially thrown my other files out and this is now my go to nail file.  ***I received this product at a discounted price for my unbiased opinion and it in no way had any influence on my evaluation of the product.***</li>
    <li> Got this today! I&#x27;ve never heard of them before but this is so neat! It actually filed my nails down softly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with past nail files just because they bend or tear while trying to file my nails. I Have flimsy nails also so I didn&#x27;t understand why they were so hard to file down but this product is so sturdy and I bought one after reading all the great reviews about it and have used It a couple times now. I can now file my nails with little effort because of how fine this product is and it leaves the ends of my nails feeling so soft and no rough edges that catch onto clothes n such. Believe me if you have never owned a glass file, which I hadn&#x27;t, you will be grateful that you purchased this product and you will never go back to cheap flimsy nail files again. I bought this product and received it fast as well got a discount of $6, not sure why but I did and I paid for 2 day shipping (which only came out to about $10 total in the end) let me tell you it was worth every penny. Product shipped fast and looks just as pictured if not more beautiful.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, really does a good job on my nails !!!!! Got at a great discounted price !</li>
    <li> This was my first glass nail file and I am quite pleased! I received the aqua blue to yellow colored file which is very beautiful. It comes in a nice little protective sleeve so you don&#x27;t scratch precious items in your purse which if you are like me is filled with a little of everything. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sandy or gritty feeling after filing and my natural nails felt very smooth after using it. I love that it doesn&#x27;t wear down after use and it can be easily washed off unlike standard emery board files. I would highly recommend this in a little beauty gift bag for a girlfriend or even for your bridesmaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and it&#x27;s solidly constructed. Carry this bad boy for extra protection from muggers and gropers on your commute to work or your evening walk around the hood. Beautiful and deadly. Well played.</li>
    <li> I love this! I wasn&#x27;t expecting to really find this to be a good quality nail file that worked well. But - it has surprised me! It&#x27;s super fine - so I don&#x27;t have to worry about rough or inconsistent edges. It almost doesn&#x27;t even feel like a nail file, it&#x27;s so smooth - but REALLY does the job! And I can see it lasting for much longer than a standard nail file because it&#x27;s glass. Super impressed so far!</li>
    <li> I did not know about glass nail files until recently and I am a senior citizen. I absolutely love this product. I can get perfect results quickly and comfortably. My nails do not split or peel. This works really well when you apply wraps to file off the edge. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
