      <li>This soap is really great so far!!</li>
      <li>I use a variety of products like this one and it works the best for my winter dry skin.</li>
      <li>These gloves, unlike those I picked up in the &amp;#34;souk&amp;#34; in Morocco, hold up beautifully through many scrubbings and subsequent cycles in the washing machine.  </li>
      <li>I think this soap would be good for the whole family.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would fit</li>

      <li>I like it because I have sensitive skin and most soaps give me an allergic reaction or give me a headache from the strong scents.</li>

      <li>I like this very much and am glad the price was reasonable and included the mitt.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quiet smell, kind of like olive oil but not quite.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of it too!</li>
      <li>IT SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
      <li>Bought this as a birthday gift for myself back in August and absolutely love it...</li>
      <li>PS: the exfoliating glove is quite abrasive and would be too much for my face.  </li>
      <li>AND REALLY CLEANS FACE LEAVIING</li>
      <li>Really cant see spending $15-$20 for the mitt.</li>
      <li>I am female with size 8 glove and the mitt fit me with room to spare.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the exfoliating glove on my face, but its gentle for the rest of my skin.</li>
      <li>This combination pack is a great value, and my skin feels so very soft after using the Moroccan Black Soap.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
      <li>Visible results at first use, makes skin soft and glowing.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend Zakia&#x27;s Kessa Glove.</li>
      <li>I was busy for a couple of days, so I&#x27;d just use regular soap and water for quick showers.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves the skin very soft and glowing it seems to me (maybe because of the argan oil?</li>
      <li>I was suffering from very dry skin on my arms and legs and with this product I&#x27;m starting to see a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>experience but does leave my skin soft and</li>
      <li>The glove is different than the one I purchased before, but performs very well.</li>
      <li>My skin is also soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>The soap feels soft and luscious when you are in the shower.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth feeling but did not see any dead skin rolling off me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks (in early fall when the weather fluctuates and my skin is usually really dry) and so far it has kept my skin well moisturized and clean.</li>
      <li>a little bit goes pretty far.  </li>
      <li>Removes dead skin cells at first use</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and live in the mountains,  so finding a product that can wash my face without drying my skin is a must.</li>
      <li>They are coarse enough to exfoliate the dead skin really effectively, yet supple enough to reach into delicate areas, like the face.  </li>

    <li> Very nice.  Leaves your skin soft and smooth feeling but did not see any dead skin rolling off me and I followed directions.  The soap feels soft and luscious when you are in the shower.  a little bit goes pretty far.  It has a slight earthy scent -- but it is no problem.  I like this very much and am glad the price was reasonable and included the mitt.  Really cant see spending $15-$20 for the mitt. I am female with size 8 glove and the mitt fit me with room to spare. I would buy this lovely soap again.  I think this soap would be good for the whole family.    PS: the exfoliating glove is quite abrasive and would be too much for my face.  But I do use the soap on my face and it leaves my skin feeling wonderfully healthy and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap it makes my skin feel wonderful after I use it . I just wished it had a different fragrance. I use a variety of products like this one and it works the best for my winter dry skin. I will purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> This product, coupled with the exfoliating glove , is giving me a glowing and smooth complexion.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was suffering from very dry skin on my arms and legs and with this product I&#x27;m starting to see a huge difference.  I would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect exfoliator. I recommend anytime anyway. Visible results at first use, makes skin soft and glowing. Removes dead skin cells at first use</li>
    <li> I really like how well this soap sloughs off dead skin.  My skin looks so healthy afterwards.  My skin is also soft and moisturized. Just love it!</li>
    <li> Just like the Hammam.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT SPECIFICALY FOR MY FACE  THE SOAP IS GEL LIKE AND REALLY CLEANS FACE LEAVIING IT SOFT AND SMOOTH I USE THE MITT DAILY WHEN I AM NOT USING THE CLARASONIC ARIA FOR MORE GENTLE EXFOLIATING. MY FACE FEELS LIKE A BABYS BOTTOM!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! I only use black soap on my skin and I do not intend returning to regular shower gels, even SLS-free. The whole Moroccan experience is such great way of pampering yourself. I will keep buying it, because it is a good quality soap; can&#x27;t wait to try orange Blossom one.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not quite as wonderful as a true Moroccan hammam, but just about as close as you can get at home.</li>
    <li> amazing product it makes your skin shine</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Your skin is so smoooth after! I really like the smell of it too! I recommend this product to everyone :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and in good condition.  The glove is different than the one I purchased before, but performs very well. Together with the soap it provides an awesome exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and live in the mountains,  so finding a product that can wash my face without drying my skin is a must. This soap is really great so far!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks (in early fall when the weather fluctuates and my skin is usually really dry) and so far it has kept my skin well moisturized and clean. I don&#x27;t use the exfoliating glove on my face, but its gentle for the rest of my skin. Definitely a good product if you have dry skin that breaks out, since almost all the other products out there dry out your skin and make it worse!  I&#x27;m also allergic to a lot of soaps and this on has not irritated my allergies at all.</li>
    <li> This combination pack is a great value, and my skin feels so very soft after using the Moroccan Black Soap.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Better than the ones I bought in Morocco!  These gloves, unlike those I picked up in the &amp;#34;souk&amp;#34; in Morocco, hold up beautifully through many scrubbings and subsequent cycles in the washing machine.  They are coarse enough to exfoliate the dead skin really effectively, yet supple enough to reach into delicate areas, like the face.  i am very happy with them.  If you haven&#x27;t tried exfoliation before, give it a whirl for the smoothest, softest skin you&#x27;ve ever expreienced.</li>
    <li> The glove is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was busy for a couple of days, so I&#x27;d just use regular soap and water for quick showers. So, on the third day when I used the glove to exfoliate, the amount of dead skin it scraped off was both wonderful and disgusting! It&#x27;s a great product. Best exfoliant I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot to treat my keratosis pilaris. That being said, the glove is a bit snug. I don&#x27;t know if it would fit a man&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is nice. It leaves the skin very soft and glowing it seems to me (maybe because of the argan oil? I don&#x27;t know). I like it because I have sensitive skin and most soaps give me an allergic reaction or give me a headache from the strong scents. This doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey. It&#x27;s a quiet smell, kind of like olive oil but not quite. Again, I am guessing it&#x27;s the argan oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this combination! I would highly recommend Zakia&#x27;s Kessa Glove. Bought this as a birthday gift for myself back in August and absolutely love it... I have not had the &amp;#34;seeing dead skin falling off&amp;#34; experience but does leave my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be a great gift for someone too! Will definitely buy it again!</li>
