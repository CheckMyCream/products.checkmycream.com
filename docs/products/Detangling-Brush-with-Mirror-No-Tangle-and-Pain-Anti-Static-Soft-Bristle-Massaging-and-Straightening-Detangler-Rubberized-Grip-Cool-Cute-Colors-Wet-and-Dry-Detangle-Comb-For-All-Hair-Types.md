      <li>I gave the brush to my daughter and she was thrilled with it.</li>
      <li>I got it to use on my hair extensions, it works better than a comb and is a good travel size, but I was expecting more and unless you&#x27;re looking for a travel size brush, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomended it</li>
      <li>more strugling....</li>
      <li>Would like to be able to get it in a more &amp;#34;boy friendly&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I had to have it cuz its colors are striking</li>
      <li>so I ordered a couple more for the cousins for stocking stuffers about a week ago.</li>
      <li>i love it..</li>

      <li>The best brush is The Wet brush</li>
      <li>This is the best to comb her hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
      <li>And a great little stocking stuffer b/c of the size and the bright colors.</li>
      <li>liked it so much that I ordered another one for my niece, who appreciate pretty and girly things, and who also needs a good detangling brush in her life.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I most likely would not purchase it again.</li>
      <li>which is fine and tangles easily.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work well on my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>This little brush is great!!</li>
      <li>I finally enjoy fixing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>The bristles are well constructed so that they smooth and detangle with ease, so whether your 5 or 105 this brush will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just want folks who see the amazing reviews to know most of them were posted at a different price point.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many hairs in the brush when I use it, but is not as good as a wet brush as this brush cannot help with styling hair.</li>
      <li>and like I said to throw in your bag when going out, but you would still need a full size brush in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I was actually pretty excited when this brush arrived yesterday.</li>
      <li>It works fine on my straight hair.</li>
      <li>This pulls on her hair through the tangle more than her old brush.</li>
      <li>actually believe this brush is only perfectly sized for young children</li>
      <li>She has more issues with me combing with this brush than the other one I was using (wig brush, metal bristles that bend easily).</li>
      <li>but then once straight in about an hour later the rats nest tangles up on its own.</li>
      <li>you so much!</li>
      <li>The first I used it...</li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t home when it came in the mail, so first I used it on my hair-</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an excellent product, I would recommend you give this brush a try, you won&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
      <li>so I went back to get a couple more</li>
      <li>Looks funny but works.</li>
      <li>Really helps get out tangles!</li>
      <li>Also, it is worth noting that this brush has a handy mirror on the back of it, which makes this an even better deal as mirrors can get mighty expensive.</li>
      <li>I like this brush, but I wish they made it in a large size too.</li>
      <li>I want to order several of these, but they are no  longer available.</li>
      <li>This brush really does work.</li>
      <li>Thanks, I give five stars</li>
      <li>wow got the tangles right out</li>
      <li>My 3 year old granddaughter hates you or her to brush her hair, till I got this and loves to look in the mirror to see how pretty her hair is</li>
      <li>But from what I can tell it works like a brush should work, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
      <li>my 5 year old daughter said this one hurt her when using it on her long, fine hair</li>
      <li>As luck would have it, the day this brush arrived, I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment and since I can&#x27;t drive two of my friends drove me and surprised me with a appointment at the hair salon, so by the time I used it, my hai was much shorter.</li>
      <li>I like the mirror on the back of it and the fun colors.</li>
      <li>It will not have chunks of it breaking off as you try and brush your hair, and you will be able to keep a firm grip without hurting yourself.</li>
      <li>nest tangled hair and have to wait for new hair from them.</li>
      <li>She needed a new one, so I gave this one a go because of their claims.</li>
      <li>It is a bit smaller than expected,  but it is cute.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my 3 year old that never lets me brush her hair or cries when I do because her hair is tangled.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush for my 3 1/2 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>We went back to the hairbrush we used before which pulled a bit but not as much as this one does.  </li>
      <li>Plus small enough to travel with and on the back has a cute mirror.</li>
      <li>Combing her hair with it is slightly easier than a regular brush, but not any better than my Wet brush.</li>
      <li>The material the handle is made out of is much firmer than I expected.</li>
      <li>I was loosing so much hair with other hair brushes.</li>
      <li>cute but a little bit too small</li>

<li> Still have to really take your time and slowly go thru hair, but it definitely helps.</li>
<li> Works well for my long wavy hair and for my son&#x27;s longish curly hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The color, style, and appearance of the brush are amazing. My daughter loves it. My daughter has sensory issues and it is difficult to brush her hair. Almost all brushes hurt and pull on her hair. This brush, while it is a good brush, for this family their claim is not all that it is cracked up to be. She has more issues with me combing with this brush than the other one I was using (wig brush, metal bristles that bend easily). I have heard from people with really thick or curly hair that a wig brush can be easier to use than a standard brush. She needed a new one, so I gave this one a go because of their claims. With their claim to be the number 1, I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. This pulls on her hair through the tangle more than her old brush. I even tried it on my own hair and it got caught and pulled it instead of being of ease. Back to the wig brush we go.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 3 1/2 year old daughter. She has long, wavy hair, which is constantly tangled, and she hates to have it brushed. She wasn&#x27;t home when it came in the mail, so first I used it on my hair- which is fine and tangles easily. I ripped out my hair. One swiped and there were multiple strands of my hair in the brush. I was not impressed. I gave the brush to my daughter and she was thrilled with it. But she loves rainbows and looking at herself in the small mirror on it. Combing her hair with it is slightly easier than a regular brush, but not any better than my Wet brush. Overall, she likes it and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I most likely would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> very good quality..i love it..</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my wife, and she loves it.  She has always wanted a brush that would remove tangles without pulling her hair, and this product does just that.  It works just like it states.  If you are looking for an excellent product, I would recommend you give this brush a try, you won&#x27;t go wrong.  It works.</li>
    <li> This brush is hard &amp; not flexible. I don&#x27;t have many hairs in the brush when I use it, but is not as good as a wet brush as this brush cannot help with styling hair. The hard bristles are uncomfortable to the scalp. I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money buying it. Now I still need a wet brush.</li>
    <li> cute but a little bit too small</li>
    <li> I want my money back.  Even with detangler sprayed on this hair brush pulled the hair out and did nothing it was advertised to do.  We went back to the hairbrush we used before which pulled a bit but not as much as this one does.  I want my money back.  I gave it enough of a chance by trying it for a while in different way and followed the directions.</li>
    <li> Worst hairbrush that I have ever used. Made more knots and pulled my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter is into pink and rainbow.  She says it brushes her hair a little easier.  She loves it!  I wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> This is the hardest brush and pulled my hair out I returned it. The best brush is The Wet brush It definitely works I bought 4 of them. Me and my girls don&#x27;t cut our hair so its extremely long and the wet brush helps us from loosing alot of hair and pulling.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would be easier to hold than the other brand that fits in the palm of you hand (I drop it constantly). I came home from a trip and my 5 year old daughter said this one hurt her when using it on her long, fine hair so she gave it to her brother! Oh well.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I thought it was going to be. I got it to use on my hair extensions, it works better than a comb and is a good travel size, but I was expecting more and unless you&#x27;re looking for a travel size brush, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomended it</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> I was having so much trouble with brushing my hair and getting too much left on the brush until I bought this brush. I thought it was too expensive till I used it awhile. Really helps get out tangles!</li>
    <li> I have a 2 year old with curly hair,  usually runs when the brushcomes out.  I do notice less &amp;#34;ppulling&amp;#34; on her hair.  This is the only brush she&#x27;ll let me use on her.  It is a bit smaller than expected,  but it is cute.  I like the mirror on the back of it and the fun colors.</li>
    <li> We use this head to toe on an English long hair cat who will not tolerate any other brush.  nuf said.</li>
    <li> Most amazing hair brush ever!</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but I wish they made it in a large size too. This one is small, like a brush you would carry in your bag. I came in to Amazon looking for this brush, just larger and the only one I found had a wooden handle and seemed to be the same size as this one. I needed several surgeries on my knee and with the brutal winter we had with bitter cold weather and snow every few days, I didn&#x27;t get out much and my thin, fine hair did what thin fine hair does best and tangled horribly. As luck would have it, the day this brush arrived, I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment and since I can&#x27;t drive two of my friends drove me and surprised me with a appointment at the hair salon, so by the time I used it, my hai was much shorter. But from what I can tell it works like a brush should work, nothing more, nothing less. I also have a problem with my rotator cuff so on the one side, I can brush the front and the side, but because the brush is small I can&#x27;t get the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually believe this brush is only perfectly sized for young children and like I said to throw in your bag when going out, but you would still need a full size brush in my opinion. It is for this reason it gave it three stars instead of four.</li>
    <li> Looks funny but works.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well on my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair.  She cried and whined a lot.  It works fine on my straight hair.</li>
    <li> I want to order several of these, but they are no  longer available.</li>
    <li> I like the brush - and I hardly ever write reviews -- but I&#x27;m appalled at the price gauging. I ordered one in November to see how it worked on my kids hair. It was $15. It was a hit so I ordered a couple more for the cousins for stocking stuffers about a week ago. Also ~$15. I decided I wouldn&#x27;t mind one for my swim bag and my daughters dance bag so I went back to get a couple more (so yeah I like the brush). It&#x27;s a great brush to detangle the kids hair for $15. And a great little stocking stuffer b/c of the size and the bright colors. But now it is ~$70. That&#x27;s crazy. It&#x27;s not worth $70 -- it can&#x27;t be that expensive to make given the size and the materials. Just want folks who see the amazing reviews to know most of them were posted at a different price point.</li>
    <li> Very cute looking brush. I bought it for my 3 year old that never lets me brush her hair or cries when I do because her hair is tangled. Because the brush looks like a toy, she absolutely loved it and now let&#x27;s me brush her hair without fussing plus she loves looking at herself in the mirror on the backside of the brush. It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair as roughly as other brushes have. I would have given it 5 if the brush was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Good product I recomiendop, your hair feels good when using this brush, you will see that your hair does not hurt. Thanks, I give five stars</li>
    <li> My daughter says that it is awesome! She says I get a lot if knots and it gets it out!</li>
    <li> I was loosing so much hair with other hair brushes. The first I used it...no hair in the brush at all. Plus small enough to travel with and on the back has a cute mirror.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old granddaughter hates you or her to brush her hair, till I got this and loves to look in the mirror to see how pretty her hair is she loves it!!</li>
    <li> Grandaughter doesn&#x27;t mind having her hair brushed! She has vey curly long hair and use to fuss when her hair was brushed.</li>
    <li> My kids  L O V E  it!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No more strugling.... I finally enjoy fixing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I was actually pretty excited when this brush arrived yesterday. The material the handle is made out of is much firmer than I expected. This is not cheap plastic. It will not have chunks of it breaking off as you try and brush your hair, and you will be able to keep a firm grip without hurting yourself. The bristles are well constructed so that they smooth and detangle with ease, so whether your 5 or 105 this brush will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I ordered another one for my niece, who appreciate pretty and girly things, and who also needs a good detangling brush in her life. I plan to give it to her for a Christmas present, which it is perfect for. Also, it is worth noting that this brush has a handy mirror on the back of it, which makes this an even better deal as mirrors can get mighty expensive. I recommend this as a great gift for that lady in your life.</li>
    <li> My little girl likes this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Cute and fancy</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the look of the brush but she doesn&#x27;t like her hair brushed with it. It pulls on her curls like a regular brush and knots it ,this is while it&#x27;s wet. This is the best to comb her hair when it&#x27;s wet. I am not saying this will be the same for everyone but it didn&#x27;t work for us. We will stick to the big tooth comb.</li>
    <li> Still have to really take your time and slowly go thru hair, but it definitely helps.</li>
    <li> This brush is a gift to the women do hear the good praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute and perfect size. The gift box asking other people.</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Works well for my long wavy hair and for my son&#x27;s longish curly hair.  Would like to be able to get it in a more &amp;#34;boy friendly&amp;#34; color though</li>
    <li> Im not a young girl... But who cares! I had to have it cuz its colors are striking and it feels nice to use ad an added bonus... Plus a mirror on the back!&lt;br /&gt;Its a no- brainer</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> This brush really does work. I currently have the worse hair extensions that I bought from a supplier and yelling at them to replace because it&#x27;s rats nest tangled hair and have to wait for new hair from them. Meantime I bought this brush and when I used to brush the rats nest wow got the tangles right out but then once straight in about an hour later the rats nest tangles up on its own. Just crappy hair, but brush works great!</li>
    <li> This little brush is great!! 🙀. I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more. One for my purse &amp; one for my table with a spare. It does everything untangles even combs.</li>
