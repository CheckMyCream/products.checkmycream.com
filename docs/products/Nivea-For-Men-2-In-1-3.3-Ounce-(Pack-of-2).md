      <li>Your face is nice and smooth and refreshed after use.</li>
      <li>good price, worth the money.  </li>
      <li>this is my favorite face-thing to use after a shower.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell but nevertheless a good product.</li>
      <li>It is now my favorite aftershave gel,</li>
      <li>What more can I ask for in a product, it delivers on what it says it will.</li>
      <li>but I bought this for abt 3 dollars more than you get in the store..</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to begin using after shave since I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend even more money on shaving supplies than I already was.</li>
      <li>...but OK as a moisturizer...probably would not get again..</li>
      <li>Nivea has come up with a good mix of all the right factors.  </li>
      <li>Applying the gel after shaving help to smooth skin, smell good and feel cool.</li>
      <li>I have never been a user of after shave but is some pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>One of the best after shave moisturizers Ive used in a long time.</li>
      <li>I am glad I got it right the first time around because this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are comparable products available online for lower prices.</li>
      <li>The balm type product coats smoothly and provides a refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>and I just enjoy using it besides just as an after-shave gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
      <li>It has a great lotion like texture of low viscosity, so it spreads onto your face really quick and smoothly.</li>
      <li>Finding a men&#x27;s after shave product that doesn&#x27;t smell cheap and actually does a good job of cooling/soothing is a task.  </li>
      <li>Only wish it was more popular in the stores.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called Cool Kick for that stinging blow to the face after rubbing this product on it.  </li>
      <li>u can feel the coolness when splashing on but wears out fast...ide like for it to be more intense too..</li>
      <li>This after shave has a pretty strong scent, almost like cologne.</li>
      <li>The fragrance seems strong at first whiff, but it subsides a lot as it dries.  </li>
      <li>, it is really quick)</li>
      <li>shipping is quick.  </li>
      <li>I am highly pleased with the soothing effects as well as its ability to protect against the elements, something i missed with my old after shave.</li>
      <li>so worth a 3 strar</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I find this to be useful instead of alcohol.</li>
      <li>It aids with the problem of slightly dry skin after shaving and leaves your face nice and cool.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t use the right product my face will show...  </li>
      <li>Cools my irritation and the price is right.</li>
      <li>There is also a light scent; at first I thought it to be a bit too medicine-like, but after a couple days I started finding it pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long.</li>
      <li>like it very much.</li>
      <li>It truly does not burn and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what you&#x27;d expect and doesn&#x27;t irritate in any way.</li>
      <li>Thanks NIVEA!  </li>
      <li>Really feels fresh.</li>
      <li>Cool Kick is a new after shave from Nivea for Men.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really choose this stuff for it&#x27;s scent but when my girl first smelled it on me she couldn&#x27;t resist from sniffing and kissing me.</li>
      <li>Really clean refreshing smell - not strong, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>more then others, no greasey after affect nice smell and just a little dab goes a long way!</li>
      <li>I think it is doing a fine job keeping my skin moisturized, and I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny.</li>
      <li>I expected more from Nivea.  </li>
      <li>Who wants to splash alcohol on their face after just shredding it with a razor?  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin on my face and this product reduces razor burn and makes me feel fresh all the time.</li>
      <li>Too much</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this product as it was always selling fast in the stores around here.  </li>
      <li>I really like NIVEA product</li>
      <li>a better job of moisturizing my skin than some other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I found myself needing to apply another aftershave to prevent my face from drying out merely moments after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the product left MUCH to be desired as it was neither strong nor pleasant.</li>
      <li>i dont know why such a great product would be so hard to find or even discontinued by aqua velva</li>
      <li>The price was ridiculously high.</li>

    <li> Arctic Freeze 2 in 1 Cool Kick is a new after shave from Nivea for Men. Nivea describes it as an \\&quot;after shave &amp; gel moisturizer.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using it for close to two weeks, and I purchased the item at Walgreen&#x27;s. It is a translucent blue thick liquid that spreads easily and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or shiny. It does have a cooling effect on the skin, but I think it is fairly subtle. There is also a light scent; at first I thought it to be a bit too medicine-like, but after a couple days I started finding it pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long. I think it is doing a fine job keeping my skin moisturized, and I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny. I have not had any problems with irritation. Unlike other Nivea for Men balms that come in this same plastic dispenser, this variety does not come with an outer box. Made in Germany.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to begin using after shave since I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend even more money on shaving supplies than I already was. Seen this stuff on sell and it said it does not burn and moisturizes, so I though why not. I am glad I got it right the first time around because this stuff is great. It truly does not burn and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth with no irritation whatsoever. Before using this stuff my skin would be really sensitive after I would shave, but now my girlfriend can touch my face all she wants. I didn&#x27;t really choose this stuff for it&#x27;s scent but when my girl first smelled it on me she couldn&#x27;t resist from sniffing and kissing me. So if you want to smell good, have a clean moisturized face then grab some of this stuff its great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this product. It aids with the problem of slightly dry skin after shaving and leaves your face nice and cool. It does exactly what you&#x27;d expect and doesn&#x27;t irritate in any way.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome it changed my shaving experience. not to mention my girlfriend likes the small and how smooth it leaves my face.</li>
    <li> I really like NIVEA product however I found this product to feel greasy on my face, did not like this and did not use all of the product.</li>
    <li> I prefer Nivea face care products over most other brands, however, I prefer the standard version of this face lotion over this Artic Freeze version. I do still use it when I feel a little razor burn as I&#x27;ve found it calms it better than the standard, but I don&#x27;t like the smell as much and I don&#x27;t feel it really moisturizers as much as the standard Nivea Men&#x27;s face lotion.</li>
    <li> Only wish it was more popular in the stores.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave with a great scent! Cools my irritation and the price is right. What more can I ask for in a product, it delivers on what it says it will.</li>
    <li> Really feels fresh. Nice odor and moisture. I definitely recommend this product to any one looking to have it used after shave for freshness , moisture and odor.</li>
    <li> This aftershave was a disappointment. I am a big fan of Nivea and their products are typically &amp;#34;reference&amp;#34; quality for me. In that I determine if a product is good or bad based on Nivea products. They are the baseline in what I expect. Also, I have been a wet shave for a number of years and have tried at least a few dozen aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This introductory product, however must be something new that Nivea is trying out as I have not seen it before. To put it bluntly, this product is piss. I wouldn&#x27;t use it if I got it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically when I try a new aftershave I apply the new product to one half of my face and something that I am familiar with to the other half of my face. This product was on the bad side in all regards. The moisturizing quality of the product did very little for my skin and I found myself needing to apply another aftershave to prevent my face from drying out merely moments after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the product left MUCH to be desired as it was neither strong nor pleasant. Read that last sentence again and think about it for a second. The scent was so bad that I was both displeased by its odor AND at the lack of odor. I can&#x27;t explain how, but that is the only way I can describe it. I am, myself, amazed that they somehow managed to fail in such egregious manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 2 stars because I am still a huge fan of Nivea and their other products and I urge anyone to try virtually any of their offerings other than this crap. This must be some line/marketing extension they are attempting to market towards the younger generation (and I don&#x27;t really hold it against them, they are a business after all). It is just that I was so disappointed with this product and it falls so below their standards that I feel almost insulted that they would lend their name to something so disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just avoid this all together, it is just an extraordinary disappointment from an otherwise good brand.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic on my sensitive skin. I has a good odor and does not cake up nor leave any residue</li>
    <li> Finding a men&#x27;s after shave product that doesn&#x27;t smell cheap and actually does a good job of cooling/soothing is a task.  Nivea has come up with a good mix of all the right factors.  The Nivea Arctic Freeze 2-in-1 product combines a facewash with a shave gel, the companion after shave, this product, follows that up with a very light, non-greasy soothing product.  After two weeks of use I can say it does a very good job.  The product either contains no alcohol or very little alcohol as there is little to no burn when applying.  The balm type product coats smoothly and provides a refreshing scent.  A little goes a long way so be careful with your application.  Too much and you will end up with lotion overload.  I am highly pleased with the soothing effects as well as its ability to protect against the elements, something i missed with my old after shave.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking...I thought this was the face balm in the hard white bottle like in the picture...so I thought it was a good deal...but I bought this for abt 3 dollars more than you get in the store..Not Happy</li>
    <li> ...but OK as a moisturizer...probably would not get again..price was good vs a lot of the competition so worth a 3 strar</li>
    <li> The perfect followup after a DE razor shave.  Feels great, smells great, works great.  Well worth the money.  A must get!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price and it works well. No sting or over the top smell, just effective, affordable aftershave. I can shave daily without irritation.</li>
    <li> Use it, great product. Will have brought it if i know of this product earlier. Great product to use, recommend</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good also and does cool the face off after a shave. Have had some woman say how nice it smells</li>
    <li> I have never been a user of after shave but is some pretty good stuff. It has a great lotion like texture of low viscosity, so it spreads onto your face really quick and smoothly. It has a initial half a second kick to it (kind of like rubbing alcohol on a fresh cut) but it quickly fades away (your barely feel it, it is really quick) and then it just &amp;#34;cools&amp;#34; your face. The feeling of razor burn is gone, it makes your face feel good and best of all it doesn&#x27;t stink! It seems quite fresh actually.</li>
    <li> This is a great aftershave conveniently delivered using Amazon Subscribe and Save service, which saves you some money plus having the benefit of being delivered to your doorstep as needed through the subscription service. The aftershave is what you would expect, and it does provide extra moisturizer when compared to regular gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it you will feel a cooling sensation, the only drawback in my opinion is that this level of &amp;#34;coolness&amp;#34; lasts a bit longer than what I would prefer, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Why, oh, why is there alcohol in this?!  Who wants to splash alcohol on their face after just shredding it with a razor?  I expected more from Nivea.  I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called Cool Kick for that stinging blow to the face after rubbing this product on it.  Sorry but my face doesn&#x27;t like to be kicked that early in the morning.</li>
    <li> I abuse this bad boy as a regular moisturizer (yes I know that is not its purpose) but it smells nice and I just enjoy using it besides just as an after-shave gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Can act as a moisturizer as a backup&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Amazon sells it as an Add-on sometimes which can be meh unless you subscribe for a scheduled delivery</li>
    <li> What a ripoff...it works no better than any other generic aftershave cream.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction and for my skin this is the best aftershave</li>
    <li> One of the best after shave moisturizers Ive used in a long time. Have saved and subscribed to this. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this product.  It is cooling and stops razor burn immediately.  It is now my favorite aftershave gel,</li>
    <li> Excepted a cooler feel, I do like the balm more then others, no greasey after affect nice smell and just a little dab goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell but nevertheless a good product.</li>
    <li> works great. excellent value.</li>
    <li> feels great. like it very much.</li>
    <li> Works great for the soothing part, but stinks.  In fact, after a week, my wife threw it away because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Really clean refreshing smell - not strong, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a better job of moisturizing my skin than some other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;27 yrs old.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am using merely drops, this is  refreshing and smooth.</li>
    <li> I like it, and did the job</li>
    <li> Love how this after shave feels on my face after I&#x27;m done shaving! Makes my skin feel smoother as well.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite face-thing to use after a shower.  it smells really nice and has a cooling feeling.  i am wondering if there is anything weird going on with this because when i was a kid, i would buy a gel exactly like this called aqua velva cooling balm.  then that got discontinued...then i found this nivea stuff like last year at walmart &amp; stocked up, then walmart stopped carrying it...finally, i found it on walmart.com and amazon so i chose to get it via subscribe &amp; save.  i dont know why such a great product would be so hard to find or even discontinued by aqua velva but im glad that i have a way to get it.  it smells really great also.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Your face is nice and smooth and refreshed after use. All the nivea products are great.</li>
    <li> Great product, my son loves it and will now not do without it.  Now my biggest problem is finding it on sale.</li>
    <li> This is a rip off one bottle for the price of two.</li>
    <li> great product, great service</li>
    <li> I like Nivea post shave balms and aftershaves. So when the wife got me this for Xmas I decided to give it a whirl. I like the convenience of it but I still prefer the two separate when I have time. This went into my gym bag and works great for those on the move days.</li>
    <li> Okay...a little too watered down.</li>
    <li> Met what I expectated</li>
    <li> u can feel the coolness when splashing on but wears out fast...ide like for it to be more intense too..</li>
    <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> Price is a bit high but this is bests after shave. Your face tingles and is refreshed. I would buy and try it if you are reading this. You will agree.</li>
    <li> shipping is quick.  good price, worth the money.  Applying the gel after shaving help to smooth skin, smell good and feel cool.</li>
    <li> Another awesome product discontinued!  This was the best gel moisturizer for men that was available on store shelves.  The fragrance seems strong at first whiff, but it subsides a lot as it dries.  My wife confirmed it&#x27;s not strong or offensive at all.  I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this product as it was always selling fast in the stores around here.  I guess NIVEA decided to attempt pushing it&#x27;s customers to spend nearly double for two thirds the amount of product in it&#x27;s newer offerings.  Thanks NIVEA!  I&#x27;m sure there are comparable products available online for lower prices.</li>
    <li> This after shave has a pretty strong scent, almost like cologne. It was not to my liking. It does burn a little bit when applied, otherwise, it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  If I don&#x27;t use the right product my face will show...  This prevents any kind of burning, irritation, and moisturizes nicely.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin on my face and this product reduces razor burn and makes me feel fresh all the time.</li>
    <li> The product is great.  The price was ridiculously high.</li>
    <li> Wish you still had this. I can&#x27;t see where you have anymore</li>
    <li> I find this to be useful instead of alcohol. I usually have razor burn or bumps after shaving, but using either alcohol or this product has improved that very well.</li>
    <li> Too bad the unethical distributor raped me for $19, plus postage, for a single $6 bottle, but that is the world we live in today. Great product!!</li>
