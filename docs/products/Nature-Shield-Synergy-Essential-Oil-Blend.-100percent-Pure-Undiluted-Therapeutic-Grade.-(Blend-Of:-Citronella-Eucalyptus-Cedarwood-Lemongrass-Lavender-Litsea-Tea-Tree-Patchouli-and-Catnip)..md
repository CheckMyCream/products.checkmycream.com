      <li>It was Awesome to see mosquitoes trying to land on my body but never did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Works great!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good stuff, so I give it five stars.  </li>
      <li>The Company is awesome and great delivery.</li>
      <li>but it works great on the mosquitos in Mexico.</li>
      <li>they turn and fly away.</li>
      <li>This item works great to keep bugs off myself and all my dogs.  </li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>and it was 100% effective on highly delicious children for around 2 hours.</li>
      <li>They would fly around us, searching for skin that had not been treated with Bug Off.  </li>
      <li>I also purchased the peppermint and am extremely happy with that</li>
      <li>Great for candles, lotions, sprays.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
      <li>I used this product to make my own bug spray!  </li>
      <li>, when I order from Amazon, my orders seem to come really quick, so I do appreciate the great service and the wonderful prices!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but not a miracle oil.  </li>
      <li>Coconut oil absorbs quickly and is excellent for the skin.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It has a really nice smell to it too.  </li>
      <li>I did not want to purchase a DEET product to keep the bugs off, so I thought that I would give making my own a try.  </li>
      <li>so I a confident this is just as good.  </li>
      <li>it......is 96% effective, though, perhaps thats because we&#x27;ve got some kamakazi squeetos here in FLA.</li>
      <li>And it is effective.  </li>
      <li>Just got done testing this stuff out in the woods and it does work, but don&#x27;t expect it to be as effective as DEET based sprays.</li>
      <li>Now we make our own.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice too.  </li>
      <li>However, they quickly lose interest and fly away once they realize we are not flowers.  </li>
      <li>I have been using here in Dominican Republic with great success.</li>
      <li>This product is most effective used in a glass spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>It helps keep away many varieties of bugs.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the scent of this oil.</li>
      <li>To me it&#x27;s better than Off</li>
      <li>it will keep floating to the top</li>
      <li>I have found a recipe that I use on Amazon that someone gave to mix it with witch hazel, distilled water and so many drops of Bug Off.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely as compared to the Off brand of bug spray.  </li>
      <li>I would give this more than five stars if I could.  </li>
      <li>its plan B and the next best thing to toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll refill our spray bottles many more</li>
      <li>Ok it did not work on the biting midges or no see us in Boca Chica Panama</li>
      <li>One of the most noticeable changes using it, is that it isn&#x27;t &#x27;sticky&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t have that chemical/medicinal smell.</li>
      <li>The insect shield is not offensive to me and way better than spraying deet on your body.</li>
      <li>We are extremely pleased with the Bug Off and will ensure that we keep a bottle in the house as well as taking it in the vehicle whenever we travel.</li>
      <li>Glass is the always best container for essential oils.</li>
      <li>This oil blend is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I applied more but still they came after me.</li>
      <li>In an 8oz spray bottle I add 40-50 drops of oil, then fill to the top with witch hazel.  </li>
      <li>I feel better using this herbal bug-off recipe - controlling all the ingredients with organic herbs</li>
      <li>so far so good!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great and all natural! !  </li>
      <li>I also dab it on my dogs to keep ticks off and it works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the company just puts a couple drops of this kind of oil in a cypermethrin spray and charges a lot of money for the \\&quot;special\\&quot; equine spray.  </li>
      <li>Having a Bio-Medical background, I am always looking for safe, chemical free ways to replace toxic household items.  </li>
      <li>This is great because it is a natural product.</li>
      <li>AND I love the fresh smell!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever carrier oil you use, just add Insect Shield to it till it&#x27;s pleasantly strong smelling and rub it in.</li>
      <li>teaspoons of Insect Shield oil blend (this is a strong mix)&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s now actually pleasant to sit outside and enjoy grilling out or a glass of wine!</li>
      <li>It blended well, smelled good, price was reasonable, and delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>Works great for when they are staying outside for longer periods of time.</li>
      <li>Also, their skin is smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know the ratios of the different oils in it, but decided to give it a try and am happy with the results.</li>
      <li>A couple of bugs did brave the essential oil blend and nipped at my husband.  </li>
      <li>Works fantastic.  </li>
      <li>we are DEET free and bug free.  </li>
      <li>It works well on the areas where it is applied (until we sweat it off), but it does not extend beyond the sprayed area to create a \\&quot;bug free zone\\&quot; of any sort, i.e. if you spray your hair, neck, shoulders and chest, but not your face, they will land and bite your face.</li>
      <li>Then filled bottle with filtered water to spray on the dogs.  </li>
      <li>We have had much greater success this way.  </li>
      <li>is far superior than taking chances with what may turn out to be toxic</li>
      <li>it works really good so far no bites</li>
      <li>It pretty much smells good to me.  </li>
      <li>Preferred to use it diluted since it&#x27;s pretty potent.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to most bug sprays, so I decided to try something more natural to get the job done.  </li>
      <li>I feel better knowing that all the ingredients are natural and safe to use on the kids.  </li>
      <li>I mix it with sweet almond oil and massage onto my legs and arms</li>
      <li>so you must keep shaking as you spray or you will not get enough of the good stuff on you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am about halfway through one bottle and have made 4 full, 8oz bottles of spray.  </li>
      <li>I gotta say it smells great and kept the mosquitos and other bugs away.  </li>
      <li>We live in Upper Lower Michigan, and have many different bugs that are just pests,,,lol,  this has been the best we have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>best natural mosquito repellants I have used have catnip oil in them (along with a slew of more common \\&quot;repellant oils\\&quot;).</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>I am absolutely phobic about insect bites since I have a huge allergic reaction when bit.  </li>
      <li>Made my own bug spray concoction in 4 ounce bottle mixed with water,  vodka,  and insect shield.</li>
      <li>This oil smells nice, it smells exactly the same as Absorbine Duraguard insect spray that we used all the time on our alpacas.  </li>
      <li>Would probably be fine replacing normal big spray for most people</li>
      <li>I used this on vacation in Mexico over the last three weeks, and as a mosquito magnet, I can say it worked great for me... as long as I remembered to use it.  </li>
      <li>I wish there were more specific instructions.</li>
      <li>I did not have a glass bottle to mix it in and used plastic which got pretty cloudy</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this essential oil blend!  </li>
      <li>you decide to make this recipe, consider dedicating a pot and utensils for this project as you will more than likely have leftover herb infusion and will want to make it again.</li>
      <li>We spend most Summer days outside, so that is saying a lot.  </li>
      <li>I applied it, I added several drops to my palm, rubbed my hands together, and patted myself from top of head to tips of my toes, including my clothing.  </li>
      <li>Used it camping this summer and it worked way better than any commercial chemical spray that anyone else was using!</li>
      <li>You need to reapply every 20-30 minutes for it to remain effective, meaning this little bottle will go fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy Essential Oils shipped very quickly after placing my order.</li>
      <li>stink a lot, as I was waiting for an essential oils product, but weirdly really doesn&#x27;t seams to work, I may sound paranoiac but I even think it attire flies and wasps... will certainly try it again once or twice to confirm but for now I don&#x27;t see the point of making them come to us...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This seems to work well in the homemade spray I make. It helps keep away many varieties of bugs.</li>
    <li> This item works great to keep bugs off myself and all my dogs.  It has a really nice smell to it too.  I spray it on animals, around my door frames, all around my outdoor camping seat as well.  I spray it on everything outside.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ll use as a bug spray ever again!  T</li>
    <li> I am a mosquito magnet and used this mixed with witch hazel and water while camping. Did not get one bite while my husband came home with several. I did not have a glass bottle to mix it in and used plastic which got pretty cloudy so I assume the oils are breaking down the plastic as reported in another review. Just received glass for next batch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on myself and it seems to work.  I also dab it on my dogs to keep ticks off and it works pretty good.  It smells nice too.  I have taken a blue glass spray bottle and put a pinch of salt (to hold the oil for even dispersing) and added a few drops in.  Then filled bottle with filtered water to spray on the dogs.  Works great for when they are staying outside for longer periods of time.</li>
    <li> Wanted to leave a review of my Bug Off.  It&#x27;s very good stuff, so I give it five stars.  I even sprayed myself last night before I went to sleep.  We&#x27;ve been having mosquito problems.  I can&#x27;t use the Off spray because it gives me a headache. But the Bug Off has not bothered me one bit. It pretty much smells good to me.  I have found a recipe that I use on Amazon that someone gave to mix it with witch hazel, distilled water and so many drops of Bug Off. I&#x27;ve also used a little bit of straight Bug Off on my wrist with no problems because I carry one of my bottles in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would highly recommend this essential oil.  To me it&#x27;s better than Off spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I order from Amazon, my orders seem to come really quick, so I do appreciate the great service and the wonderful prices!</li>
    <li> This does keep the mosquitoes at bay, but the bees may be more interested than usual...they are attracted to the scent.  However, they quickly lose interest and fly away once they realize we are not flowers.  The bottle says you can &amp;#34;dilute in witch hazel (2-3%) and spray on clothing.&amp;#34;  I just put about 40 drops in about 2 oz. of distilled water in a spray bottle and it seems to work.  I wish there were more specific instructions.</li>
    <li> I put this on with high hopes, but as soon as I walked out I was bit. I applied more but still they came after me. I was really hoping I could be done with chemical sprays but with the threat of  West Nile I don&#x27;t have much choice.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Used it camping this summer and it worked way better than any commercial chemical spray that anyone else was using! I add a few drops of this to detangling spray and spray in my sons hair before school each day, in an effort to keep any erroneous, creepy lice away that might want to jump on him,... so far so good!  Also I use a few drops in a spray bottle with some other ingredients and spray around the window / door frames where my cats like to lay in the sun to keep any fleas from wanting to jump on them.</li>
    <li> This product is most effective used in a glass spray bottle.  Oil is attracted to plastic and will try to cling to it, and it will change your dilution ratio.  Oils can also lose some of their effectiveness in metal containers.  Glass is the always best container for essential oils.</li>
    <li> ....................And have not used it yet.  I also purchased the peppermint and am extremely happy with that so I a confident this is just as good.  I just haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet.</li>
    <li> I live in the woods and have 2 dogs - we are at constant battle with bugs. A few drops of Bug-Off is all it takes to restore peace. I rub a few drops in between my palms then rub each dog down. No more bugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting out on our patio I sprinkle a few drops into a diffuser and we are left to enjoy ourselves!</li>
    <li> We live in Upper Lower Michigan, and have many different bugs that are just pests,,,lol,  this has been the best we have ever tried.  Even the little gnats stay away.  I use it in a spray, with witch hazel and also just on a cotton ball.  Works fantastic.  The Company is awesome and great delivery.</li>
    <li> As dictated by my wife, the actual user of the product: We live in the South and each summer can be an experience in being &#x27;eaten up&#x27; be mosquitoes and &#x27;no-see-ums&#x27;. Synergy Essential Oils has dramatically improved that. One of the most noticeable changes using it, is that it isn&#x27;t &#x27;sticky&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t have that chemical/medicinal smell. It does require, as the instructions state, needing to be mixed with a diluting medium like Witch Hazel for application, but dilution also extends the use of the Essential Oil. It can be applied directly to your skin (and won&#x27;t stain clothes either) and IT WORKS! Depending on how long you spend outside (i.e. long nights on the deck) it may need to be reapplied and it isnt&#x27; a guarantee against getting any bites at all, however, the one or two (literally) bites I have had while using this are nothing compared to what it was like with other, harsher products and it&#x27;s now actually pleasant to sit outside and enjoy grilling out or a glass of wine!</li>
    <li> I used this during this past summer by putting a couple of drops on my hands and rubbing it on my exposed body parts including my face and neck since mosquitos are attracted to the carbon dioxide we breathe out. It has a slight ginger scent which I like.  I didn&#x27;t get bit while I was wearing it. I am absolutely phobic about insect bites since I have a huge allergic reaction when bit.  One bite will swell up to a 6 inch diameter on me!  I like the aroma but apparently my kids and mosquitos don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also applied it to my husband who breaks out in a rash whenever I put bug spray or sunscreen on him.  He didn&#x27;t have any issues with Insect Shield causing any rash and he didn&#x27;t get bit where I put it on.</li>
    <li> I made the Wellness Mama Bug Bars ([...]) and Bug-off was listed as an optional ingredient. I don&#x27;t remember how much I added, but it was on the high end of the suggested amount. It blended well, smelled good, price was reasonable, and delivery was quick. The Bug-Bars work - the mosquitoes land but keep looking around for a Bug-Off free area - they simply will not try to bite through the stuff.  I feel better using this herbal bug-off recipe - controlling all the ingredients with organic herbs is far superior than taking chances with what may turn out to be toxic insecticides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you decide to make this recipe, consider dedicating a pot and utensils for this project as you will more than likely have leftover herb infusion and will want to make it again. Although it did not take long for the project itself, it was difficult to get the melted wax out of and off everything).</li>
    <li> It appears to work quite well.  Fellow hikers could smell it quite a distance away from me and I never saw a single fly or mosquito near me for a few hours.  I do apply a few more drops after a few hours and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  I take a few drops and rub it over my clothes and skin.....presto...no insect bites.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling insect repellent and with healthy ingredients.  I put in spray bottle with some witch hazel.  Keeps the mosquitos away for a while but must keep spraying.  Compared to the synthetic chemical made repellents and what they do to your body, I will continue to spray.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural alternative to the Off products that contain the toxic chemical deet.  Did some research and came across this..  After reading several positive reviews I purchased it.  I  researched some mixes with this and found that witch hazel was the easiest.  I bought a 16oz bottel of witch hazel and poured all of it in a new spray bottle and added 110 drops of this with dash of distilled water and shook it up.  I gotta say it smells great and kept the mosquitos and other bugs away.  I was camping with my family and I applied this to everyone several times thoughout the 4 day stay.  And it worked for everyone.  It was Awesome to see mosquitoes trying to land on my body but never did.&lt;br /&gt;I never got bit until the last day when I ran out of it...  Then I got bit multiple times.  This stuff is great and all natural! !  Just get it and you wont be sorry!  I will use this from now on..  Love this stuff!!  Did I mention that it smells great!!</li>
    <li> I used this on vacation in Mexico over the last three weeks, and as a mosquito magnet, I can say it worked great for me... as long as I remembered to use it.  The bites I *did* get were when I&#x27;d had the windows open, showered before bed and forgot to dab some on.  And on my last morning, I went to breakfast (open-air restaurant at the hotel) without protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it, I added several drops to my palm, rubbed my hands together, and patted myself from top of head to tips of my toes, including my clothing.  Once I did that, I rubbed my exposed skin for a little more protection (real or psychological, I dunno).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: I added several drops to my sunscreen, went out to the beach and the BEES were on me in 5 seconds flat!  Not kidding.  I didn&#x27;t use that sunscreen again and had no other bees.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: Yesterday, I saw online adding a few drops of essential oil to the inside of the toilet paper roll keeps the bathroom smelling fresh.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  And that gave me the idea of adding drops to an empty toilet paper roll to put in my closet to hopefully keep bugs (moths) away from my wools.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I just mixed it with witch hazel and I have been spraying it on at night when I sit outside. So far I am not mosquito bait. I am a person who always gets bit. I bought this to use in Nicaragua and accidentally left the bottle in the refrigerator. I got eaten alive day and night in Belize. When I got back to the states I bought it again for our travels. I have been using here in Dominican Republic with great success. We go on to Panama and then Mexico so I am hopeful I will have the same results. Also I started taking B1, although some research suggests that doesn&#x27;t work. I have also read to eat garlic. So there are orders the Mosquitos don&#x27;t like. The insect shield is not offensive to me and way better than spraying deet on your body. I recommend trying and I hope it works for you! Ok it did not work on the biting midges or no see us in Boca Chica Panama but it works great on the mosquitos in Mexico. Also you can dot a few drops on your skin on pulse points like you do perfume. I have seen mosquitos come close to my leg to land and about 3 to 4 inches away they turn and fly away. Remember to carry a spray bottle and spray under the table on your legs when out at night. This is great because it is a natural product.</li>
    <li> The scent is lovely as compared to the Off brand of bug spray.  I feel better knowing that all the ingredients are natural and safe to use on the kids.  I&#x27;ve used this in tropical central American countries like Belize and Costa Rica and very minimal insect bites.  Have used it undiluted and sparingly on the skin as we as diluted with almond oil.  Preferred to use it diluted since it&#x27;s pretty potent.  Made my own bug spray concoction in 4 ounce bottle mixed with water,  vodka,  and insect shield.</li>
    <li> We live in sub-tropical South Florida. We have mosquito swarms. That is not an overstatement. During bouts of extended warm wet weather, if you are unprotected, and you stop moving, they will coat you like an disturbingly odd furry blanket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best natural mosquito repellants I have used have catnip oil in them (along with a slew of more common \\&quot;repellant oils\\&quot;). We spend a lot of time outdoors and were going through a bottle of repellant every week. After some research, I found this Insect Shield essential oil blend that has all the ingredients I was looking for. I don&#x27;t know the ratios of the different oils in it, but decided to give it a try and am happy with the results. It works well on the areas where it is applied (until we sweat it off), but it does not extend beyond the sprayed area to create a \\&quot;bug free zone\\&quot; of any sort, i.e. if you spray your hair, neck, shoulders and chest, but not your face, they will land and bite your face. Never-the-less, we reapply often and are still saving money with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 oz spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;Fill 3/4 with *alcohol based* witch hazel. I use this one [[ASIN:B00LBHBS1Q Thayers - Witch Hazel Astringent with Aloe Vera Formula Lemon - 12 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons of Insect Shield oil blend (this is a strong mix)&lt;br /&gt;Shake well and keep shaking as you spray (the oil does not emulsify in this recipe/ it will keep floating to the top so you must keep shaking as you spray or you will not get enough of the good stuff on you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried adding vegetable glycerine to the recipe, but there was no added benefit so I leave it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will save more money and go for the big bottle of Insect Shield next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> This works great to keep bugs off!  I mix mine with a few drops of almond oil.  No sticky or smelly skin, actually leaves my skin feeling soft!  We also use the same mixture for our dog, instead of pricey, chemical filled products.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> For maximum results, mix this into a carrier oil. I&#x27;ve gone the spray bottle with water and alcohol route and it doesn&#x27;t last as long and isn&#x27;t as effective. I blended twelve drops into about a 1/4 cup of coconut oil and it was 100% effective on highly delicious children for around 2 hours. Also, their skin is smooth and glowing. Coconut oil absorbs quickly and is excellent for the skin. Bug repellent you can feel good about slathering on a newborn; it doesn&#x27;t get better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever carrier oil you use, just add Insect Shield to it till it&#x27;s pleasantly strong smelling and rub it in.</li>
    <li> sigh. its plan B and the next best thing to toxic chemicals. i grin and bare the pungent aroma. it......is 96% effective, though, perhaps thats because we&#x27;ve got some kamakazi squeetos here in FLA. lol</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the scent of this oil. Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do and will definitely order it again and again!!</li>
    <li> I did not want to purchase a DEET product to keep the bugs off, so I thought that I would give making my own a try.  I mixed this oil blend with some witch hazel and it works like a DREAM.  No bugs, no harmful chemicals, and even smells kind of nice (for an insect repellent).</li>
    <li> My husband has a fair complection and, living in the South, is usually voraciously nibbled on as soon as he steps outside.  After having to take a round of antibiotics because of one of the last bug bites he received, I searched for something that would better protect him from future bites while maintaining our as-close-to-nature as possible lifestyle.  Other reviewers gave Bug Off glowing reviews, yet I remained skeptical until it could be tried out on my husbad&#x27;s fair skin.  Instead of diluting the Bug Off with witch hazel and distilled water, we used it in the manner as another reviewer recommended by putting two drops on our palm, rubbing our hands together, then wiping our hands over exposed skin and on our clothing. When we stepped outside, the bugs were not happy.  They would fly around us, searching for skin that had not been treated with Bug Off.  A couple of bugs did brave the essential oil blend and nipped at my husband.  As a result, he has opted to apply two drops of Bug Off onto each leg.  We have had much greater success this way.  We are extremely pleased with the Bug Off and will ensure that we keep a bottle in the house as well as taking it in the vehicle whenever we travel.</li>
    <li> I bought Insect shield for the southern Louisiana mosquito filled evenings. I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it but after using it a few nights I must say wow! I am allergic to insect repellant but can use this. I would give this more than five stars if I could.  Shipped fast and received in only a few days.</li>
    <li> stink a lot, as I was waiting for an essential oils product, but weirdly really doesn&#x27;t seams to work, I may sound paranoiac but I even think it attire flies and wasps... will certainly try it again once or twice to confirm but for now I don&#x27;t see the point of making them come to us...</li>
    <li> After reading about health concerns of using DEET (the stuff that makes OFF mosquito repellant work) I started a bit of researching and found that the right combo of essential oils will get the job done.  I bought this product and have made a couple of bucket candles and also mixed it with witchhazel as a spray on for the kids AND put it in with citronella oil for my camp lanterns. NOW...this was NOT all done with one bottle.  It&#x27;s good, but not a miracle oil.  I&#x27;ve used a few bottles.  And it is effective.  My family camps quite a bit...and we used citronella/lemongrass candles...the same thing in lanterns...and applied OFF spray...and at sites with heavy mosquito prescence used OFF ground foggers. Now with the candles I made, spray on I made, and the boost I gave my oil lanterns...we are DEET free and bug free.  This stuff will help with ticks as well.  Since then, I have added a couple other essential oils to increase effectiveness and am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Just got done testing this stuff out in the woods and it does work, but don&#x27;t expect it to be as effective as DEET based sprays. You need to reapply every 20-30 minutes for it to remain effective, meaning this little bottle will go fairly quickly. Still got 3 or 4 bites last night, which is a massive improvement over nothing, but I would absolutely NOT recommend for areas where malaria or other mosquito born illnesses are prevalent. Stick with DEET if you are worried about those.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Just like the expensive natural bug repellent but concentrated so you can make many products from this one. Great for candles, lotions, sprays. I live in Alaska and our state bird is basically the giant mosquito. This time of year we have swarms of them. This stuff repels just as well or better than the nasty chemical stuff. I can use this on my kid, my dog and myself without worry. Plant Therapy Essential Oils shipped very quickly after placing my order. I placed a large amazon order and theirs was the first to arrive in only a couple of days. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This oil smells nice, it smells exactly the same as Absorbine Duraguard insect spray that we used all the time on our alpacas.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the company just puts a couple drops of this kind of oil in a cypermethrin spray and charges a lot of money for the \\&quot;special\\&quot; equine spray.  Now we make our own.  I discovered that you can buy your own pyrethroid type raw ingredient from DoYourOwnPestControl and mix it with a few drops of this oil (+ some Piperonyl Butoxide raw ingredient for a faster knockout), and that will be equivalent to one of those super expensive horse fly sprays, for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I usually make my own blends, But bought this particular one because it has catnip which is very expensive on its own (which probably means it has very little in it, lol).  The whole family uses this.  I put it on a bracelet for my my five year old everyday.  She is an allergic mosquito magnet!  I can&#x27;t use it totally in place of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; (deet) when we&#x27;re going to be heavily outside, but it does the trick for her daily.  Would probably be fine replacing normal big spray for most people but like I said, we are bug magnets!</li>
    <li> Having a Bio-Medical background, I am always looking for safe, chemical free ways to replace toxic household items.  This oil blend is fantastic!  We are in S. Texas with mosquitoes as big and blood thirsty as they come.  In an 8oz spray bottle I add 40-50 drops of oil, then fill to the top with witch hazel.  Shake before each use and spray all over your body.  I&#x27;ve used this on myself, husband, children (ages 1yr, 4yrs, 12yrs), other adults and dogs.  Result:  no bites!  It smells like citronella and eucalyptus, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant and surely beats the chemical smell of deet from OFF.  Additionally, I was concerned about my youngest child&#x27;s sensitive skin (he has severe eczema), and this solution did not cause any outbreaks or hives. I am about halfway through one bottle and have made 4 full, 8oz bottles of spray.  Great product!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> I used this product to make my own bug spray!  It was effective without the scary ingredients in commercial sprays AND I love the fresh smell!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this essential oil blend!  I am allergic to most bug sprays, so I decided to try something more natural to get the job done.  I use this in a beeswax based bar for my family, and we barely ever get bug bites!  This smells great and a little goes a very long way.  I recently purchased the bigger bottle, but the smallest bottle lasted me about a year.  We spend most Summer days outside, so that is saying a lot.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I brought this becouse i was told that it would help to stop haveing bites after moving to NC I mix it with sweet almond oil and massage onto my legs and arms it works really good so far no bites</li>
    <li> I mixed about 50 drops with about 16oz of witch hazel. Mosquitoes stay at bay. However, they will still land and bite on areas that were not sprayed, such as faces. In heavily infested areas, I suggest both spraying clothing and a hat to help deter them. I also added geranium oil because of it&#x27;s ability to deter ticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the increased initial cost of the essential oils, this is a very economical bug spray. We&#x27;ll refill our spray bottles many more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the scent has received several compliments, affording me the opportunity to explain a bit about essential oils.</li>
