<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Actually a perfect matte lipstick. Highly pigmented. True BLACK. As to be expected some will come off if drinking, smoking, eating, etc. But only a *little*. Buy this, it&#x27;s really really worth it.</li>
    <li> Really good quality just make sure you protect your lips before applying -like with any black lipstick</li>
    <li> Bought this lipstick for a costume. And lemme say it&#x27;s pretty amazing. The black color doesn&#x27;t fade and does not go on patchily. For some reason it bonded to my mouth and needed only one additional application! I ate and drank and smudging was minimal! Matte color also looked very nice!</li>
    <li> The first true matte black I&#x27;ve come across!  Just be sure with your application, as this can be hard to get off your skin</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite lipstick now♡ it looks beautiful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
    <li> Sent the wrong color. But good quality lipstick my mom loves it. I ordered The black one and got red.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. It&#x27;s not greasy like most black lipsticks out there and has a smooth matte finish. It&#x27;s is also  highly pigmented so a little goes a long way. Even though it does transfer easily onto cups/straws/faces it won&#x27;t smudge on your lips. Also, try to avoid eating greasy foods because the color will bleed a little on the corners of your mouth. Overall this is a great product, definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  Smells good, spreads easily and super pigmented!</li>
    <li> I was a little iffy about what people are saying but it is an amazing product. I did notice that my lips did get a bit dry but it isn&#x27;t bad at all. Just used some lip balm over it and it has a very nice colour.</li>
    <li> very chalky and drying</li>
    <li> Cute but hard to take off</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find black lipstick, especially a good one. Although a bit pricey, this lipstick is worth the buy. Yes, it is matte and it is easy to apply. It is very dark and will stay on your lips as long as you don&#x27;t wipe them too often. I had reapply mine after 3 hours but only because I kept touching it. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and it looks fabulous! Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a good black lipstick, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is very matte and very black. It a great lipstick if you are looking for something dark. The packaging was great. The shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Matte blk lipstick love it</li>
    <li> Product shipped very fast, color is very dark &amp; vibrant... however it doesn&#x27;t stay on long. I had to reapply it at least once an hour, and it smears very easily! I&#x27;ll still wear it, but would never get this brand again.</li>
    <li> wow probably my favorite lipstick, perfect matte color and feels super nice on.</li>
    <li> Too in love. A beautiful matte, jet black color that has some smudging. Doesn&#x27;t dry out and only needs a single application, besides eating and drinking throughout the day. Better than my own matte MAC lipsticks. Smells delicious as well!</li>
    <li> I did not like this. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good black pigment lipstick and when this arrived it was brown. The quality overall is okay but without a primer the pigment looks a little worn.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick!! It&#x27;s a true black, not a dark purple like other companies that try to sell black. Also lasts long!</li>
    <li> very good but a little pricey</li>
    <li> Great color and opaqueness. Just makes my lips a little dry</li>
    <li> really black. And dose not smear!</li>
    <li> My wife wears the heck out of this stuff and always says how greatful she is I got it for her, so it can&#x27;t be too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come off on me when she kisses me, so giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The lipstick has a rich colour and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lipstick, arrived earlier than expected. Perfectly Matte. My only issue was that it can rub off if you touch it so be careful. Other than that it&#x27;s everything I wanted. Definitely going to buy more colors.</li>
    <li> Great lipstick. Very creamy</li>
    <li> Awesome lipstick! Works great:)</li>
    <li> Perfect black matte lipstick! Exactly what I was looking for, and well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This is my first black lipstick and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell or taste, it doesn&#x27;t transfer super easy, and it looks matte but doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out. It is also insanely opaque, which made me very happy.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product for my makeup for my first prom, and I was very upset when I received this product. As soon as I opened the lipstick, the stick had fallen out of the tube into the lid. I don&#x27;t know the quality of the product itself, as it was unusable. I am sending this back as soon as I get the chance. I am very upset, as I find this price ridiculous for a small tube of black lipstick anyway, let alone one that falls out. It very well could have been jarred around during shipping that caused this, but regardless I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this lipstick was too shiny for me.</li>
    <li> The color is very dark and since I&#x27;ve been looking specifically for full on black lipstick, I was shocked by how dark it actually is! It was perfect shade of black:) the only minus I could find was that if I drink anything or kiss anyone, it sticks to my drink and the person.. My perfect lipstick would be the one that would stay just on me and not come off real fast. However, this is the best anyone could find for this price!!:)) definitely recommend to anyone on the dark side!</li>
    <li> I love the look and it was what I was looking for but it was as matte as I was hoping for but overall acheives the desired effect.</li>
    <li> This brand never ever fails! I love this line so much and I&#x27;m satisfied with this lipstick.</li>
    <li> First of all, the case is gorgeous it looks expensive and badass. The lipstick is of really good quality too, some black lipsticks are really thin and not dark enough. This one is rich and thick and I love the matte texture.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn black lipstick for many years and the last one I&#x27;ve worn was a cheap lipstick I bought at a costume shop and it sucked. It smeared really easily, plenty of reapplication was required, and it wasn&#x27;t very black. However, Nosferatu is definitely black. I only needed to apply it once and voila, beautiful, luscious black lips. It glides on smoothly and it&#x27;s so comfortable to wear, I forgot I even had it on. It will definitely stain, of course. My hand has received a few black marks from accidentally brushing past my lips. But the black still stays on. This lipstick was worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a solid black lipstick for a long time and all the ones I had ever boughten  didn&#x27;t turn out black but instead a greyish color that was just unflattering. I would certainly buy this product again. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it stays on for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. I&#x27;ve been trying forever to find a decent black matte. My only complaint is that it does smudge and come off easily. Definitely not kiss proof, which is to be expected, but the smudges are nearly impossible to get rid of.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a little more moisture, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality black lipstick. The only disappointment is that its a satin finish and not a matte.</li>
    <li> Because of its color, this lipstick is not very forgiving. It&#x27;s completely opaque, goes on thick and you have to be careful of smudging! For best results, apply chapstick/lotion first. It does dry your lips out some. And don&#x27;t touch your mouth!</li>
    <li> Nosferatu is a TRUE black, which I appreciate! I recommend getting a clear lip liner as it bleeds a little, but otherwise it is perfect and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love it! It came quickly and the quality was great. It smears a little easily, but it feels so nice on your lips and comes off easily and quickly! I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very dark, perfect for any homestuck cosplay or just rad goth makeup. It will stain your lips slightly unless you clean them offrally well, but the look is great and the matte is flawless</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely everything!!! I have been looking for a black color that wouldn&#x27;t bleed or be to light! This color is dark and last all night!!! Got so many compliments!!  Thank you!! Well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for halloween and have never used lipstick before. Really easy to apply. It does smudge really easily. For my costume, I only need it on my top lip and in a few minutes, my bottom lip is also black....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and from what I can tell (little experience with lipstick) it seems highish quality.</li>
    <li> Worked well, and was very matte and bakery black as expected, but fell apart when I went to use it&lt;br /&gt;Easily fixed, but slightly disappointing</li>
    <li> Having tried MANY black lipsticks before---this lipstick is FAR MORE SUPERIOR than any I have tried.  It goes on smooth--- has full coverage and has a velvet matte finish.  Holds up all day during performances and those hot stage lights. You may have to touch up here and there...but that is completely normal...especially if you are sweating and on stage!</li>
    <li> Best black lipstick I&#x27;ve ever got , so smooth and latest for a long time . I only had to apply it again once . I recommend it if you are into the really pitch black. I love it !!!</li>
    <li> there arent very many high quality goth make up brands out there. most black lipsticks you find are bad quality or if theyre good quality theyre over priced. This lip stick is incredibly smooth, it feels light weight and nice on your lips. it goes on like a dream and stays all day. thanks manic panic for supporting the beautiful weirdos out there.</li>
    <li> Excellent color!! Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great matte black!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so cute on!! doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all. perfect!</li>
    <li> I really like this. The casing is so cute. But the lipstick itself is kinda hard to apply especially when you&#x27;re as pasty as me, and it stains when you wipe it.</li>
    <li> This is my first Manic Panic Lippie .. normally, I mix their &amp;#34;Amplified&amp;#34; colors w/Ion Color Brilliance Brights to extend wear of &amp;#34;punky colors&amp;#34;..&lt;br /&gt;Long story long, I wanted a:&lt;br /&gt;- heavily-pigmented&lt;br /&gt;- TRUE black&lt;br /&gt;- *matte*, but non-feathering&lt;br /&gt;- cruelty-free&lt;br /&gt;lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;This takes the WHOLE cake and then some!! I could wear it ALL day and then some.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very alternative look &amp; this just completes it.&lt;br /&gt;Much love to Manic Panic &amp; All Hail Nosferatu!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as well as another brand of lipstick to use for cosplay purposes at comic con. This shipped later than expected, but I was still able to use it for the last day. After struggling with the other brand (LA Colors Moisture Lipstick), I had extremely low expectations, but this was absolutely fantastic. Extremely pigmented, goes on easily, dries out a bit but applying chapstick beforehand doesn&#x27;t affect its longevity or application. I wore it for nine hours and only had to touch up after eating. Surprisingly great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear this lipstick very often but when I do I get a lot of compliments. It&#x27;s worth every penny..</li>
    <li> This black lipstick is the bomb. I was using cheap Halloween makeup before.. LOOK AT ME NOW</li>
    <li> Worse color and do not last more than a few minutes. I am very disappointed by this product.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely lovely!</li>
    <li> absolutley beautiful lipstick. It goes on smoothly and perfectly and looks extremely sleek. It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and is definitely matte. Smudges a little, as with any lipstick, but is amazing for the price. Perfect finish to my goth Lolita look.</li>
    <li> Great color for a great price! This lipstick is amazing and even smells good, unlike some lipsticks. But let me tell you, this lipstick does not come off easily! Soap and water and a lot of scrubbing! Which is good, I hate reapplying all day, but for a person who only wears black lipstick for cosplay, it can be a fun time. I still love it and anyone looking at this to buy for a cosplay or just everyday use, go for it! You won&#x27;t regret it! The color is beautiful, and it lasts forever!</li>
