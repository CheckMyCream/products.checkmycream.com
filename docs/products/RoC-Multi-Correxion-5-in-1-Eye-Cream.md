      <li>thank you for making this available .</li>
      <li>Roc is far superior to that product PLUS</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried a Roc product &amp; I love it.  </li>
      <li>Great for winter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
      <li>so far this product is pretty good.</li>
      <li>This product is my main line, along with sunscreen in the desert, use this at night before retiring, wash face well, it works, it works, love it.</li>
      <li>It looks younger and has such a healthy glow!!!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product, and intend to purchase again in the future.  </li>
      <li>While this line of Roc products is nice, I don&#x27;t think it has enough alph-hydroxy in  its ingredients to make a difference.</li>
      <li>This lotion is GREAT - my skin has so smooth, soft, mostly blemish-free, and I have gotten so many compliments since starting to use it a few weeks ago!</li>
      <li>This product does have a little  smell but somewhat pleasant.  </li>
      <li>My skin is so sensitive that 15+ years ago my neighbor tried M___K__ cleanser on my face and it turned bright red.  </li>
      <li>The cream is very light, does not leave a greasy film on your face, you can definitely feel the cream working on your face without any irritation.  </li>
      <li>This really does work...just give it time!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t start noticing improvement until I used it consistently.</li>
      <li>I love the way my face feels the next morning.</li>
      <li>I have never tried the RoC Multi-Correxion 5-In-1 restoring night cream, this is my first time purchasing this cream on Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>I will order more of the entire line....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you think.</li>
      <li>Love the cream and plan to buy it againüëçon my first jar and starting to see a difference.</li>
      <li>Been using this products not for four Yrs straight Havent missed a day!  </li>
      <li>It (surprisingly) dries up new pimples faster than any other product with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I used this product and the eye cream  for one night and the next morning I woke with a bright, red , itchy rash and swollen eyes.</li>
      <li>Once again I can&#x27;t rate this product high enough I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old and this is the first face cream I have used until gone and reordered!</li>
      <li>it really works for me.</li>
      <li>I really hope it does because I want to like this cream, but need my chin to quit breaking out.</li>
      <li>it seems very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I really like this night cream.</li>
      <li>I tried to research the hexinol technology without much luck.</li>
      <li>and it is VERY hydrating, my face doesn&#x27;t look and feel like paper in the winter anymore.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very oily and this clogged my pores, which lead to acne.</li>
      <li>My initial impression is that I love it - makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for four weeks now, and my acne scars are fading and becoming much more flush and even with my skin tone, and I&#x27;m getting noticeably fewer breakouts with smaller (and less cystic) pimples.</li>
      <li>I have used this in the past, but had run out, and it is somewhat expensive, but this offer was the best value, and this product works, I have aged skin, and live in the desert, and I can tell you, it is absolutely effective, when used regularly after washing face, reduce fine lines, and get that glow, used along with a vegetarian diet, with plenty of water, and you will not be disappointed,&lt;br /&gt;Update 4-6-14</li>
      <li>I wake up with very soft skin!</li>
      <li>It also received high ratings on the Dr. Oz show.</li>
      <li>going to keep on used this to see if it does a little better.</li>
      <li>This has improved my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
      <li>It has helped reduce the Grand Canyon between my eyebrows into a small gully.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different creams, washes, and other treatments, and this one takes the cake!</li>
      <li>Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>using this, the cleanser, ordered the sensitive skin night cream, too.  </li>
      <li>Early 60&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I find that this one is slightly more irritating to my skin, giving a slight burning sensation, but other than that, it seems OK.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this cream for anyone who wants to see various results in their daily facial skincare regimen.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the day and night cream for over 6 months and have noticed that it has reduced some fine lines on my forehead.  My husband loves how it smells.  I used L&#x27;Occitane for a year, but I was looking for a less expensive product.  The retinol initially caused some minor redness, but it went away after a week.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream - it is not TOO heavy so it does not clog my pores and it is VERY hydrating, my face doesn&#x27;t look and feel like paper in the winter anymore.  The affordable price is a plus!</li>
    <li> smells good, goes on very smooth, moisturizes nicely, and feels great on my face.  I&#x27;m 51 years old and this is the first face cream I have used until gone and reordered!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks...no visable outstanding, life changing differences, but not over oily. I sometimes have issues with night cream. This is light, smells nice (light scent) and does not leave me super shiny. I also do not feel like I have a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; all over my face, as I have also experienced with some night creams. I will keep using this. I also feel like it was a lot of cream for the price, which is always a nice surprise. I feel that night cream especially comes in a much smaller container- I can see this lasting me at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> This gives your face a nice clear bright look.  I like the ROC products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing improvement. I&#x27;m 30 and struggle with occasional breakouts ANDY fine lines around my eyes. This has improved my fine lines and dark circles. I recommend being diligent about using this every night before bed. I didn&#x27;t start noticing improvement until I used it consistently. I wake up with very soft skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a difference. My skin is very oily and this clogged my pores, which lead to acne.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cream at my door!</li>
    <li> I have always hated using moisturizer on my face..it makes my oily skin look and feel even oilier. This lotion is GREAT - my skin has so smooth, soft, mostly blemish-free, and I have gotten so many compliments since starting to use it a few weeks ago!</li>
    <li> I think I bought the wrong product.  I had heard from &amp;#34;Real Simple&amp;#34; that Roc was the best alpha-hydoxy product around.  While this line of Roc products is nice, I don&#x27;t think it has enough alph-hydroxy in  its ingredients to make a difference.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel. Only been using it a week and my face feels softer. Alittle pricey I feel money well spent.</li>
    <li> so far this product is pretty good. seen some change in my face. going to keep on used this to see if it does a little better. will keep you inform</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it feels very light on the face. I was concerned that it didn&#x27;t say where it was made on the box, just where the brand was created and distributed from. I emailed their customer service and they said &amp;#34;Our ROC MULTI CORREXION¬Æ 5 in 1 Restoring Night Cream is manufactured in the USA.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this one. My initial impression is that I love it - makes my skin so soft. I love the way my face feels the next morning. However, my chin has been breaking out since using it. This is a problem I&#x27;ve had on and off my whole life, so not sure if it&#x27;s this product or something else. I&#x27;ve switched up a few other things in my routine to see if that helps the problem. I really hope it does because I want to like this cream, but need my chin to quit breaking out.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition.  There has been no skin irritation and after two weeks of using it my wrinkles have diminished somewhat.  Also, the dark spots have faded slightly.  I will continue to purchase the Multi Correxion Night Cream as well as other products of ROC.</li>
    <li> I tried it for a week and it started to burn my skin after a few days. I quit using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Roc Products.  There great for sensitive skin.  I use it at night before I go to bed.  Then if I choose to wear during the day then it&#x27;s versatile.  You can use either for night or for the day time</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this item.  I love all of Roc&#x27;s products.  I believe they are the best on the market.</li>
    <li> After 7 weeks of use I can see a more even skin tone clearer firmer appearance. I will keep buying .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this night cream and I use it in conjunction with the eye cream.  I can see a definite change in the appearance of my skin.  It looks younger and has such a healthy glow!!!</li>
    <li> works well!  i see a difference!!!  it does what it says it will do.  you dont have to use alot.  i use a qtip to apply it.</li>
    <li> Dries the face. It did softed the brown spots, but not much for the wrinkles. Good night cream for over the counter.</li>
    <li> Love the cream and plan to buy it againüëçon my first jar and starting to see a difference. It also received high ratings on the Dr. Oz show.</li>
    <li> I love it this product</li>
    <li> Love the lotion, but it almost seemed like I was given a used product. No protective seal on jar, etc.</li>
    <li> Great for winter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase !&lt;br /&gt;I love all roc products they deliver what they preach!</li>
    <li> Having a tub makes it hard to get product out without mess. A tube would have been better.Still cream was ok.</li>
    <li> I used this product and the eye cream  for one night and the next morning I woke with a bright, red , itchy rash and swollen eyes. I tried to research the hexinol technology without much luck. Use these products with caution , they may cause an allergic reaction .</li>
    <li> Like the product, but the scent is very strong, get rid of it and it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and make your face feel great afterwards.</li>
    <li> arrived on time like the way it is not greasy</li>
    <li> Works awesome but i expectd it to be. I received it in record time</li>
    <li> Well it hasn&#x27;t &#x27;corrected&#x27; anything, so I&#x27;m learning to keep my $$ in my pocket, and age gracefully. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the Roc product line.  good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past, but had run out, and it is somewhat expensive, but this offer was the best value, and this product works, I have aged skin, and live in the desert, and I can tell you, it is absolutely effective, when used regularly after washing face, reduce fine lines, and get that glow, used along with a vegetarian diet, with plenty of water, and you will not be disappointed,&lt;br /&gt;Update 4-6-14/I get compliments on not looking my age.  This product is my main line, along with sunscreen in the desert, use this at night before retiring, wash face well, it works, it works, love it.</li>
    <li> Tried this after another roc product that had retinol and I realized retinol creams are the way to go. Going back to the roc product with retinol.</li>
    <li> I have used this nightly for some time and mindlessly applied it, never assuming this product could be the cause of my extremely dry skin.  I have googled skin disorders for a month thinking I had seborrheic dermatitis.  Scaly, irritated skin that looked like dandruff all over my face.  Red splotches and even acne.  I think my skin has been screaming at me from the inside out and this week it finally hit me.  I have never applied moisturizer on top of the product, and maybe that is what you are supposed to do?  Anyway, Im done with it.</li>
    <li> Once again I can&#x27;t rate this product high enough I love it.</li>
    <li> THIS cream is an Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Specially to use at night!&lt;br /&gt;I trully recommend it!</li>
    <li> Been using this products not for four Yrs straight Havent missed a day!  Couldnt be without it..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Stuff.. WIll recommend.. See My Next Order in Four Months...</li>
    <li> Early 60&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve earned my lines.  Had dimples as a child and they are now nice vertical lines.  This product does have a little  smell but somewhat pleasant.  It is the only negative. For my lines and face skin texture within 7 days a change was occurring.  The lines were not so pronounced as texture seemed softer and plumper.  If you have a lot of trouble with product smell resulting in headaches or migraine headaches, my opinion the product is not for you.  If you don&#x27;t, try it and you should love your skin!.  Wish I had tried it sooner.  I will order more of the entire line....using this, the cleanser, ordered the sensitive skin night cream, too.  My skin is so sensitive that 15+ years ago my neighbor tried M___K__ cleanser on my face and it turned bright red.  I since have used M___ K__  and did not have a reaction.  Roc is far superior to that product PLUS another product I mail ordered.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It has helped reduce the Grand Canyon between my eyebrows into a small gully. Hoping that with continued use, the gully will morph into a smaller creek bed. This really does work...just give it time!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness - i tried to use this but it smells like cheap perfume - it&#x27;s really bad.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried a Roc product &amp; I love it.  It&#x27;s been only a little over week, but the texture of my skin is already showing signs of improvement</li>
    <li> Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Keeps the flaky browns spots at bay...but on the oily side over the course of a day.</li>
    <li> very nice product. I would recommend this to others. it really works for me. thank you for making this available .</li>
    <li> I formerly used Roc multi correxion in a tube and they stopped making it.  I find that this one is slightly more irritating to my skin, giving a slight burning sensation, but other than that, it seems OK.  It seems to act as a defoliator on some parts of my face so  that&#x27;s OK with me.</li>
    <li> This cream is heavily perfumed, which caused a rash over my entire face. Really disappointing that a face cream would be perfumed.</li>
    <li> This item is different from what I bought in target and drugstore.com,I am going to return it,  It may be a fake product, Be ware!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this cream works as I couldn&#x27;t wear it long enough due to the HORRIBLE scent! I have used other ROC products and have liked them, but this one smells of bad 80s floral/powdery perfume. Please make an unscented version.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It smells great. it seems very moisturizing. It has a very good price, when considering how well it works.</li>
    <li> Although many agree that RoC products are excellent with great results.  I have never tried the RoC Multi-Correxion 5-In-1 restoring night cream, this is my first time purchasing this cream on Amazon&#x27;s website. I usually purchase Olay Regenerist Night Recovery or Age-Defying Classic Night Cream brands.  My friends/family members kept recommending the RoC brand to me, and to my surprise this surpassed my expectations.  The cream is very light, does not leave a greasy film on your face, you can definitely feel the cream working on your face without any irritation.  It does not have any fragrance or smell that is unpleasant.  You can definitely see the difference in your appearance when you awake, knowing that this cream was working during the night while you were relaxed.  I recommend this cream for anyone who wants to see various results in their daily facial skincare regimen.  I am very pleased with this product, and intend to purchase again in the future.  I have received excellent results from this night cream.</li>
    <li> This is my regular night cream.  Glad to be able to save a bit of money on the purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you think. Was recommended this by a family friend who is a dermatologist, his wife does has used this at night for 10+ years and she looks amazing. I saw fine lines decrease within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and noticed a difference after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! I have a lot of acne scars and continue to get a few breakouts even after being on Accutane three times. I&#x27;ve tried many different creams, washes, and other treatments, and this one takes the cake! It (surprisingly) dries up new pimples faster than any other product with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been using it for four weeks now, and my acne scars are fading and becoming much more flush and even with my skin tone, and I&#x27;m getting noticeably fewer breakouts with smaller (and less cystic) pimples. Along with taking maca powder and fish oil, this best completes my skin care routine. Good luck and I recommend giving this product a try!</li>
    <li> Wonderful - but even more drying than the other serum so it will remove surface layers over time.</li>
