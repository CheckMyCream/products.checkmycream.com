<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This cream was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I like the way it works.  It is a cream so it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue; it is fragrance free so I don&#x27;t have to contend with an odor and it keeps my lymphademic legs from drying out and cracking.  What more can one ask of a body cream?</li>
    <li> Best cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I use this lotion, after my dermatologist recomended it for some dry patches on my legs and arms. This lotion works  that&#x27;s all I have to say.  I use the entire Amlactin line. If you use it daily, you will see changes in your feet, cuticles, etc. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> Helped heal cracked feet.</li>
    <li> Best cream on the market.  Does wonders for my Diabetic husband&#x27;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by his foot Dr. and has worked better than any other&lt;br /&gt;product he has used.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I can really tell a difference in my skin when I use it!  It is heavy, but it really does work!!!</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this for her since she is allergic to many products and needs something that is very hydrating.  This works well for her.</li>
    <li> Really like it. My skin is extremely dry from Nevada heat; I use faithfully ...no more itching. Recommended to several of my friends; all who purchased are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Daily Use Shows In Very Soft, Smooth &amp; Youthful Looking Results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his feet break out in a rash that even the Dr.s cannot tell us what it is.  This cream helps the rash to the point it almost goes away. This seller got me this product in a VERY TIMELY Manner.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on the palms of my hands. This product seems to do a good job of hydrating and is about the best product I&#x27;ve used, without creating other problems {allergies}.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!! It&#x27;s a great product and my skin loves it. If you have extremely dry skin like me, then you&#x27;ll probably go through it pretty fast.... So the 3 pack is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I totally love this stuff.  Wish it didn&#x27;t have sticky stuff on back of tube from where price tag was obviously pulled off.  But, the product is outstanding.</li>
    <li> This product speeds up cell overturn.  Will gradually lighten hyperpigmentation.  I do NOT use on my face or neck as it is too aggressive on these areas.  Recommended by my dermatologists.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find locally and it&#x27;s a great product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris (&amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) and mild sun damage on arms and legs. My dermatologist recommended Amlactin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about two months, and have seen some improvement with the KP, and some improvement with the callouses on the bottoms of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fast and complete &amp;#34;cure,&amp;#34; but definite improvement -- better than I&#x27;ve seen with other OTC moisturizers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Amlactin products (and other brands of creams and lotions with lactic acid) have a mild, strange scent when first applied, but I find it&#x27;s not noticeable after half an hour or so.</li>
    <li> Dry skin that nothing else can touch is tamed by Amlactin Body Cream. A dermatologist told me about Amlactin years ago and I have used the lotion but the cream is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rather expensive product but worth every penny.</li>
