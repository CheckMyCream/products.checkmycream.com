<li> It&#x27;s a deep hot neon pink!!</li>
<li> but you can fix that by using a white base (I use Wet n Wild French White Cream) and Seche Vite top coat.</li>
<li> Or anytime of the year, dressed up or down.</li>
<li> It is slightly matte</li>
<li> /&gt;Update, the second time I used this, it chipped the very day I put it on, the next day it was just peeling off, it was horrible.</li>
<li> The formula is a bit thick but not to bad, I could cover in 2 coats some nails I did have to do three, you could probably do it in 2 coats, I don&#x27;t like doing thick coats.</li>

    <li> beautiful color! It does require a minimum of 2 coats, but looks great with a great tan!</li>
    <li> I really love this color. It&#x27;s a deep hot neon pink!! The formula is a bit thick but not to bad, I could cover in 2 coats some nails I did have to do three, you could probably do it in 2 coats, I don&#x27;t like doing thick coats. It isn&#x27;t shiny, it&#x27;s pretty flat, but just put on a coat of top coat and then your nails are shiny!! Can&#x27;t wait, going to the beach in June, definitely going to bring this color with me :) great color for summer!! Or anytime of the year, dressed up or down. The picture I took i have had it on for 3 days. If you like the bright yellow I have on my ring finger, it&#x27;s by color club called under the black light, its a bright neon yellow I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, the second time I used this, it chipped the very day I put it on, the next day it was just peeling off, it was horrible. Not sure why it did this, I really love this color. It was like I had put on kids nail polish that you put on and can just peel off! Guess I will be looking for a color close to this in another brand.</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery. Love it.</li>
