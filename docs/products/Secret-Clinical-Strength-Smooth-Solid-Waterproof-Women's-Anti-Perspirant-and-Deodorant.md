      <li>Its a great product for odor control, after a busy day I still feel the fragance.</li>
      <li>It has a nice mild lavender fragrance that I really enjoy.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that strong.  </li>
      <li>Oh and the scent is really nice, very feminine and not too strong.</li>

      <li>This fragrance can be a bit strong but it is pleasant and I will try some of the other fragrances.</li>

      <li>only kind that seems to work for me...</li>
      <li>Good prove versus other stores</li>
      <li>Finally, a deodorant that really works for even the most perspiring people!</li>
      <li>but it keeps me nice and dry during the hot summer months.</li>
      <li>Works Great all day long strength if you don&#x27;t shower the next morning</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a great long lasting clinical formula deodorant.</li>
      <li>The other clinical strength brand that&#x27;s popular made my armpits itch all the time.  </li>
      <li>And of course, it&#x27;s just as effective as the other varieties.</li>
      <li>When you first apply it, though, it has a strong scent of like men&#x27;s deodorant mixed with lavender.</li>
      <li>I worry about applying such a strong chemical to my skin</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>that I know my pits will be dry and smelling fresh!</li>
      <li>Prior to that, I used men&#x27;s deodorants for years because I couldn&#x27;t find a strong enough woman&#x27;s brand.  </li>
      <li>The lavender is subtle and smells nice all day.  </li>
      <li>, I was always self conscious although my hubby swore that I did not smell!</li>
      <li>Wow, what service!</li>
      <li>My best friend raved about the clinical strength, so when Amazon had a digital coupon that I could &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; I took the plunge, never will I go back to my regular secret anti-perspirant.</li>
      <li>This one keeps me dry for almost 24 hours which is still better than other clinical brands.</li>
      <li>I decided to try a &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; version, and WOW</li>
      <li>The smell is a little overwhelming at first and it leaves a little residue on my clothing-</li>
      <li>I love that it keeps me dry but feel icky thinking about all that aluminum my armpits are absorbing.</li>
      <li>Sitting in a hot muggy office is now much more tolerable now</li>
      <li>A little of the cream goes a long way, so if you need to apply more than a couple of swipes, I&#x27;d recommend waiting for it to dry before dressing, as it shows up on clothing.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but in a subtle way, and has been effective where other deodorants have failed to endure.</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t had any issue with perspiration, either, but I usually don&#x27;t anyway.</li>
<li> No more BO, no more under-arm stains, no more embarrassment!</li>
<li> I am one of those people who has a hard time finding deodorant that works all day, and this does for me.</li>
<li> I usually use the Secret Waterproof, but saw this and read the reviews and thought I would give it a try.</li>
<li> It came to me broken...</li>
<li> Tried the regular and hated it!</li>
<li> I do not stink horribly after working out either!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> only kind that seems to work for me...</li>
    <li> Used it, it worked, smell wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Works Great all day long strength if you don&#x27;t shower the next morning it will still smell good lest for me it dose</li>
    <li> The best antiperspirant/deodorant for sweating and odor, especially stress sweat, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I can apply this one day, and if I shower and forget to apply it the next day it feels like it&#x27;s still working - it&#x27;s that strong.  It says to apply the night before but I always shower and apply in the morning.  I worry about applying such a strong chemical to my skin but it does work so I will stick with it for now.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective deodorant and has avery&lt;br /&gt;nice fragrant of Lavendar</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great long lasting clinical formula deodorant. This one keeps me dry for almost 24 hours which is still better than other clinical brands. Secret should try to make this product free of aluminum in the future. I love that it keeps me dry but feel icky thinking about all that aluminum my armpits are absorbing. Guess its the price to pay for keeping dry. Oh and the scent is really nice, very feminine and not too strong.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! I&#x27;m on a ketogenic diet for health reasons, and when your body produces ketones, they STINK. They completely overwhelmed my previous deodorant. I decided to try a &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; version, and WOW what a difference! All day long, and no stink. I&#x27;m not embarrassed to stand next to someone, even at the end of a long day. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with perspiration, either, but I usually don&#x27;t anyway.</li>
    <li> Honestly I wish I found this stuff sooner! Sitting in a hot muggy office is now much more tolerable now that I know my pits will be dry and smelling fresh! Even if I do get breakthrough moisture the smell is still fresh!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  The lavender is subtle and smells nice all day.  I only apply in the morning after a shower (not at night as suggested.)</li>
    <li> The deodorant is long lasting. I love the smell of it. I would recommend this deodorant to everyone. Thank you</li>
    <li> Its a great product for odor control, after a busy day I still feel the fragance. But not so good as an antiperspirant, didn´t work that great for my sweating problem</li>
    <li> It works quite well. Since I started using it I have not once noticed any body odor from myself or my clothing which used to happen daily. This fragrance can be a bit strong but it is pleasant and I will try some of the other fragrances. In spite of the cost I&#x27;ll probably keep using this product.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but in a subtle way, and has been effective where other deodorants have failed to endure. It&#x27;s a cream/paste consistency that pushes up through a cut away cap. A little of the cream goes a long way, so if you need to apply more than a couple of swipes, I&#x27;d recommend waiting for it to dry before dressing, as it shows up on clothing. Once it dries, it won&#x27;t show up. Overall, this is a good deodorant and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love that this will last all day at work and will leave me barely smelling bad or anything at all under my arms. I have to walk a lot and in Florida the heat/humidity can be unbearable. Coming back to my office with sweaty and stinky armpits is a terrible feeling, so I&#x27;m glad that this keeps things under control. When you first apply it, though, it has a strong scent of like men&#x27;s deodorant mixed with lavender. Not that it&#x27;s terrible or anything, but I expected something more feminine. Either way, it&#x27;s very effective and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my shirts.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little overwhelming at first and it leaves a little residue on my clothing- but it keeps me nice and dry during the hot summer months.</li>
    <li> My best friend raved about the clinical strength, so when Amazon had a digital coupon that I could &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; I took the plunge, never will I go back to my regular secret anti-perspirant. I never notice any underarm odor in the morning. I get sweaty when I sleep and would notice a pit smell in the morning, I was always self conscious although my hubby swore that I did not smell! I do not stink horribly after working out either! Now I use my old ant-perp rent sticks for the bottom of my feet during sandal season here on the East Coast where humidity makes your feet slick and sweaty!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s very effective!  Will order more.</li>
    <li> LOVE.......LOVE.........LOVE the scent! This is my only deodorant that I will ever use again. I am so impressed. Who needs perfume???</li>
    <li> It came to me broken... so I havent been able to use it.</li>
    <li> Tried the regular and hated it! This one keeps me smelling fresh all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clinical Strength for a few years and I really like it a lot. The other clinical strength brand that&#x27;s popular made my armpits itch all the time.  Prior to that, I used men&#x27;s deodorants for years because I couldn&#x27;t find a strong enough woman&#x27;s brand.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this, as I was concerned it would be overly scented.  But it isn&#x27;t at all.  It has a nice mild lavender fragrance that I really enjoy.  And of course, it&#x27;s just as effective as the other varieties.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Degree Clinical brand instead. I stress sweat a lot, especially with my line of work, and this product did not seem to keep me as dry as the Degree brand did, throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Secret Waterproof, but saw this and read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I am one of those people who has a hard time finding deodorant that works all day, and this does for me. I am excited I have found another option to choose from!</li>
    <li> Very light scent, effective /strong deodorant. Highly recommend. Goes on smooth and blends in well.  Good prove versus other stores</li>
    <li> Finally, a deodorant that really works for even the most perspiring people! No more BO, no more under-arm stains, no more embarrassment!</li>
    <li> I work in a area where i sweat a lot. I purchased this hoping for great results and it has I highly recommend this item. it does miracles</li>
    <li> Only thing that works on me</li>
    <li> I received two of these last week and one of them would not dispense anything. I mentioned this in my packaging review and the seller, MAXSALES emailed me and offered to send a replacement! Wow, what service! I have used this product for about a week and I really like it. I got the lavender scent and it is a really nice, mild smell. The gel dries quickly and does not leave a residue on my clothes. It works great as a deodorant and anti-perspirant. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> pleasant odor and good sweat control but overpriced at over $11</li>
    <li> It works like it says it will, and I love the scent.</li>
