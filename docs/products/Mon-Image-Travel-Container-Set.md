<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t leaked yet and are as described.</li>
    <li> Misrepresented - but back to that below.  The tubes are fine - large enough openings for filling, decent dispenser tops, flexible tub for squeezing.  The included labels, however, do not adhere well to the tubes.  You may have to find another method of marking the tubes to indicate the contents.  Just the right size for traveling and to satisfy TSA requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the misrepresentation - The image of the product clearly show 4 different colors, with a disclaimer that the colors may vary.  I received 4 CLEAR tubes - that is not a variation in color.  In my case, that was fine, I prefer the clear tubes and would have ordered them that way if there had been that option.  But for those expecting to get what they ordered, it is a clear misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, for the record, this is a reoccurring problem in their advertising that Amazon can, and should, get under control.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and size for travel. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great.  For  Traveling  Or  At  Home</li>
    <li> The tubes seem very sturdy once the cap is tightened. The plastic travel baggie that they came in was bittle and cheap, but I did not make this purchase for the bag.</li>
    <li> Yes, the colors of my item vary - from white to white! In fact, there are no colors - all 4 tubes are white. Colors would have been useful - these, not so much. I guess white tubes are cheaper than the vibrant colors in the picture.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! Great quality. Ordered one set and ordered more.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and the quality is superb!! We buy our lotion in the larger size and then fill these bottles so we can keep one in each car, beside the computer/desk, in the kitchen, and by the bed. They never leak and it provides an economical way to have good lotion where ever we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the quality for the price.  Also note that the labels are made of paper, and when wet will not hold up.  I went to our local drug store after I got the item, and found the identical set, by the same manufacturer for half the price.</li>
    <li> Came in variety of colors, not that it matters to me. Easy soft plastic that will be easy to squeeze lotion or whatever out of. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling and have plastic labels for identification.  Well made and just the perfect size</li>
    <li> Used these lovely bottles on two trips this year. One three day weekend in NYC and a four day getaway in Miami. They hold the perfect amount of product. And the colors make it easy for me to distinguish different products in each bottle. They also super easy to wash and rinse out.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic set for travellers. I take out one of the tubes and use it as my toiletry bag. It fits a small toothbrush and small tube of toothpaste along with some other small toiletries. It&#x27;s very easy to take through security then. The tubes also fit a good quantity of liquid in.</li>
    <li> I love these things!! They make packing cosmetics into my carry on bag a breeze.</li>
    <li> Nice size containers!</li>
    <li> Its good but it wont last a long time</li>
    <li> My family uses and reuses these things for travel anywhere! They are a bit hard to clean, but I throw them in the dishwasher and we reuse them again and again. They are soft so they&#x27;re easy to squeeze and they are the right size for airline travel. Just an all around good product for an inexpensive price. I couldn&#x27;t find anything similar in a few box stores I went to before purchasing these. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the cheap ones I did find in those stores.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Plastic is lightweight. The tubes are sturdy and cap good.&lt;br /&gt;Like the different color assortment.  I used a Sharpee to mark what the contents are.</li>
    <li> I need small size tubes for trip. I used them last time on my trip. They are perfect. No problem on airport. Size is good for a week stay somewhere. Thank you</li>
    <li> Best travel bottles I&#x27;ve found. I travel a lot for work &amp; pleasure (more than 30+ times a year), and these bottles have never let me down. They have never opened unintentionally, and have stood up to all the abuse that the airlines can throw at them. The color variety makes it easy to know what&#x27;s inside, and they also come with labels that you can apply to the bottles (half are blank so you can customize them).</li>
    <li> These are my go to travel bottles! They work great, NO leaks (which is very important to me). I mainly use mine just for Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at Wamart but for whatever reason they&#x27;ve not had them so I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon. These are the best travel bottles ever for shampoos, lotion or whatever. Almost every travel bottle I&#x27;ve tried ends up coming open or leaking contents all over - the last thing you want when traveling - but these little guys stay closed and sealed inside a suitcase very well. I still seal everything in a Ziploc just in case but have never had a mishap with these bottles even with liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the size, just perfect. I try to save weight and volume and so don&#x27;t want too big of a thing but at the same time some travel items are so dinky that they barely get you thru the trip. I like Nalgene for leak-proof but most of their containers are really tiny. These on the other hand are sized exactly right for the everyday basics like shampoo, body wash, lotion. The price is reasonable so I feel like I can go ahead and purchase what I need and don&#x27;t have to be too miserly about getting what I need.</li>
    <li> I used to have GoToobs, but after a few years they got gross (they weren&#x27;t cleaned out after a trip, and stuff got thickened and clingy to the inside of the bottles).  I thought I&#x27;d give these Mon Image tubes a try since they&#x27;re so much cheaper, and they were great.  Took liquid laundry detergent in one, hair conditioner in another, for a trip into the mountains.  Neither one leaked.  Very happy!  I used a piece of freezer tape and wrote on it with an ultra fine Sharpie to label the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might try to find these tubes in your local store first, in the travel-size toiletry aisle.  These are a bit more here at $6.99 for 4 tubes with a cheapie zippered bag.  I later was at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger) and found these exact same tubes for $1.09 each.  Ah well, close enough.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I thought this are okay.  The bottles are good but the pouch seems flimsy.</li>
    <li> I got the clear ones, and they&#x27;re great. I had no problem getting my shampoo and conditioner in them, and I squeezed and stomped on them to see if they leaked and they didn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Great product and shipping. Just used these to travel to Europe.  They were perfect</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to fill and remove products from these bottles. It was a great travel investment!</li>
    <li> These worked fine for my vacation, good price, and a small piece of plastic sandwich wrap between the tube and the screwed-on cap kept me from finding out if they might leak in transit.  The various colors were a nice bonus and sharpie markers worked fine for labeling.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than GoToobs and get the job done!  I ordered these based on the many positive reviews.  Despite their &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; appearance in the picture, they worked quite well with no leaks, and were easy to fill and use.  I have no complaints and plan to use these on many future trips!</li>
    <li> I used these for homemade toothpaste.  They are easy to fill and the contents come out easily and evenly.  I read some of the reviews that said they were clear the ones I got were colored exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> Honestly haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m taking it on a 2 month overseas trip. Seems a little bit cheap, but it&#x27;s decent for the price and seems it&#x27;ll work well for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update a year later:&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought 3 packs of 4, and two of the packages were all clear which is weird. I did not care about which colors, but I did not want clear see through ones, so I&#x27;m changing my stars from 4/5 to 3/5. They worked fine last year when I travelled to 16 countries though.</li>
    <li> Somehow I didn&#x27;t expect them to be as large as they were.  Looks like they would hold a good 4 ounces at least but I&#x27;d rather too large than too small.  Haven&#x27;t filled them yet but expect them to do well.</li>
    <li> When I buy shampoo, I buy the huge economy bottle that is way too big for the shower caddy.  Using these little guys helped neaten up my shower fast.</li>
    <li> I travel a good amount for work and these travel tubes are easy to use and refill so that I am not continuously buying overpriced travel products.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, easy to squeeze, easy to label, and easy to organize. They are exactly what I need for traveling.</li>
    <li> These are great. They hold a lot and they are sturdy. They are easy to stand in the shower and easy to grab even though they are smooth they are not slippery.</li>
    <li> I too was looking at the Go Toob and then found these. The other reviewers experiences made my mind up. These are perfect - really strong flip top cap that seals solidly. Wide opening for easy filling. Mine are the coloured ones as pictured. Perfect size too. You will not regret buying these!</li>
    <li> These tubes are great for travel!  As opposed to the typical sample size containers, these allow you to get the last drop out!  I will never use the old kind again!</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, no issue with leaking, comes with labels that stick even if tube is kept in shower!&lt;br /&gt;I keep one with lotion in my purse</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, do not buy.  Lids broke after using them for just a few months.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought them.</li>
    <li> Not happy - ordered twice - got all WHITE both times - I must have the colored ones.  Says colors will vary but white is only 1 color</li>
    <li> I love these - they are the max size you can get for carry-on and don&#x27;t leak.  Even with liquids.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used them yet but for the price they seem good, will see how they do, we&#x27;re using them for homemade toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love these easy to fill containers for my must have liquids on vacation. No leaks, holds a lot, and the different colors make identifying  the contents very easy.</li>
    <li> These are great, nice size, the labels are good and they work well to hold items within the rules of TSA to carry on!</li>
    <li> I prefer these bottles than the ones sold at Target or Walmart because it actually fits the whole 3oz, perfect for carry on for air travel. Have used it several times this year and have not had a leakage/spillage yet. However, I wish it was easier to put labels on. The labels fall off, and I just used a sharpie to write in the names, but that too is rubbing off over time. Overall though, it serves its purpose well.</li>
    <li> These tubes do not list their size anywhere on them. I know. TSA agents vary from airport to airport but more times than not they immediately look to read the size posted on the item.  I won&#x27;t use these because I don&#x27;t trust them. How hard would it have been to imprint 3ozs on the tubes?.</li>
    <li> A Good Quality pruduct.Stayed closed on checked luggage.... No leaks! A great addition for travelers. Pre printed labels a benefit!</li>
    <li> When this was delivered and I started filling them up I realized the end wasn&#x27;t sealed right. It leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m an avid review reader, so I knew these wouldn&#x27;t be colored, but I had some hope anyway when I ordered that maybe I&#x27;d be the special one that got all these pretty colors. I didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s disappointing, since I have a very solid color cue system that even my fiance understands because he can rhyme it. Shampoo&#x3D;blue; body clean&#x3D; green; lady soap (not for you)&#x3D; pink; and then purple&#x27;s conditioner. It works for us.&lt;br /&gt;But the price was unbeatable, the reviews were great, and they kept all our liquid hygiene products safely inside with no leaks or dribbles in the slightest. Good product, but colors would be fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel set of high quality. Comes with it&#x27;s own labels for easy marking as well as some blank ones to label yourself. The tubes stay closed nicely and the carrying case is great to keep everything contained.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I ordered it and received in less than one week.  The product description was accurate.  I was happy with the product.  These travel tubes are easy to fill (shampoo, lotion, etc.) and easy to squeeze out and use all of the product.  I am happy with the fun colors too.  I recommend these tubes for traveling, or to easily carry lotion in your purse or gym bag.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m glad I got them. They came with little labels you can put on them as well. I probably won&#x27;t use those, but they were a nice extra. They were very easy to fill and seem durable. I really wanted tubes because when I travel, I often find it next to impossible to get my shampoo, conditioner etc out of those little travel bottles you can buy in sets. The sides are so stiff on them. I just don&#x27;t like them. This is a great solution to that and I&#x27;m sure I will be able to get everything out of these tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was alright with the purchase, but yesterday, the store I found tubes just like them sold, individually for $1 each. I guess that&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I suppose I would have rather purchased them for the lower price at the store.</li>
    <li> Bought a set for travel earlier this year.  They work great- no leaks, cracks after 3 plane trips.  Just ordered a second set to replace other travel bottle that cracked.  Great alternative to the more expensive silicon variety.  Only negative is they come all white- not a variety of colors shown and the labels do not stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and miss the bright colors. Otherwise these containers hold up *very* well and are just great!</li>
    <li> Came clear, not colored, but I can&#x27;t complain. Worked well for shampoo!</li>
    <li> A lot have complained that these come as clear bottles instead of multi-colored, but thats actually what I was looking for so I&#x27;m happy.  The cap has stayed secure for me and holds liquids well.</li>
    <li> These tubes a bit bigger than the ad shows.  Although I haven&#x27;t used them on an actual airplane yet, they seem to have a decent seal.  They are easy to fill with lotion, shampoo/conditioner.  I would be wary of using them for anything truly liquid.  With airline regulations limiting carry on products to 3 3.4 ounce containers,  one of these tubes would have to be stashed in checked baggage.  I think they will hold their contents better than a bottle but just to be sure, I will double bag them.  The last thing I need is for my suitcase&#x27;s contents to be ruined by a burst tube. If I have a problem with them during my trip, I will update this review.</li>
    <li> These are great.  We use them to organize our shower AND travel, so they see more use than one would expect (daily) and they have held up for many months.  Tops show no signs of wearing out at the hinge, even though it is a &#x27;bendy&#x27; type hinge typical of these type of bottles as opposed to a &#x27;proper&#x27; hinge that doesn&#x27;t slowly wear itself out ever open/close cycle.  The mouths are wide enough to fill very easily from any container you might reasonably have in a bathroom.</li>
    <li> overpowering smell of plastic even after being washed several times.&lt;br /&gt;opening is not large enough to put home made products in with ease (ie not from a squirt bottle)</li>
    <li> These travel tubes arrived very quickly and, unlike several other reviewers, the ones I received were the colors pictured and not clear. I was pleasantly surprised by this, since I love bright colors, but was half expecting them to be clear after reading other reviews. I still have yet to use them since I just received them, but they seem to be pretty good quality. My mother-in-law has some of the same ones, but clear, and hers have held up great. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these. Easy to fill and clean, and they don&#x27;t leak everywhere.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;the tubes were actually clear instead of the color ones showed. i prefered the clear kind. i wish i could buy these wholesale. pretty good stuff!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love these, well made and easy to fill!  No leaking!</li>
    <li> The tubes do a good job of not leaking, being easy to squeeze, and standing up. The included stickers are convenient, but not very sticky.</li>
    <li> I just wanted some smaller tubes that I could fill up with my shampoos and soaps for travel and these were exactly that. Not a bad price, no leaks, easy to fill up and some extra tags for identification.</li>
    <li> If you need a smaller container to put your products in to get on an airplane as a carry on, this will work great for you.</li>
    <li> These bottles were great for my new business of selling and marketing my Walters Passion Lube and all I had to do was buy the 55 gallon of lube here &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant Gallon/dp/B005MR3IVO/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_sbs_indust_1  &amp;lt; with a cost of .15 a oz. rebottle it into the 2 oz. bottles the resell here for $8 a bottle wife and I were ecstatic. we were raking in the cash. After the 3rd drum we outsourced someone to fill the little bottles we were getting RICH. until the government wanted to see our permit. seems you have to let the FDA know you are selling lube. the EPA said we had to have a permit from them too. now they have took my house my cars. My wife has left me for the guy with the FDA. and I got a ticket because the truck load of lube crashed into the river. all those poor fish..</li>
    <li> Bought based on another&#x27;s review compared to the expensive go toobs.  Theses Are better and so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as other reviewer posted go toobs are reactive to many products, where I did not notice any reaction with these.  Another plus, when my husband inevitably leaves them behind, I will not get mad.</li>
    <li> These tubes are easy to fill, and the included labels are nice.  Perfect, and work as advertised.  Get them now!</li>
    <li> I purchased these at a local drugstore with relatively low expectations considering the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they performed on a cross-Atlantic trip -- no leaks whatsoever! The tubes are quite supple and look like they&#x27;ll stay that way. I&#x27;d love to see them made in a smaller size but you can fill them with as much or as little product as you like so they&#x27;re quite versatile. It&#x27;s also amazing how much less space a travel tube takes up compared to a travel bottle. Great product! UPDATE 6/28/13: On a trip a few weeks ago (my third time traveling with these by air), the tube with my shampoo leaked. I&#x27;m not sure if that was the container&#x27;s fault or if I didn&#x27;t close it properly. Fortunately, I also have a plastic box that I pack all my liquids in (I have too many to carry on the plane) so the leak was contained.</li>
    <li> I did a bit of research before buying these travel tubes as during my last trip I had something break in my luggage and liquid leaked out.  These worked out great and held more than enough for 10 day trip.  I used them for face cleanser, body lotion, shampoo and conditioner.  They are easy to fill and the top snaps closed very tightly.  They come in a heavy, plastic zip closed bag which I kept them in and then put that inside another plastic bag (just in case).  I did not keep these in my carry-on but put them in my checked luggage.  No damage and nothing leaked.</li>
    <li> As many have noted, I received all clear containers.  I would have like colors but overall I&#x27;m happy with these containers.  The tubes are easy to fill (good sized mouth) and squishy enough to easily squeeze.  I&#x27;ve used these on 2 trips already and there is no sign of cracking and leaking.</li>
    <li> Great for travel. I used them to out shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion to avoid having to pack all the big bottles. They work perfect for this purpose. No leaks. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> There is a nasty smell coming from the storage pouch. If it doesn&#x27;t air out, I will just use a zip-lock bag. Like the tubes so far. I got 2 sets, one clear, one colored-perfect for those of us who need glasses. ;) Dinged one star because of the odor.</li>
    <li> I saw these recommended by a YouTuber who said they were the perfect travel containers for toiletries, &amp; she was right! I was able to fit just enough to last me the 2 wks. I was on vacation. Top twists off &amp; fill opening is a good size, so they&#x27;re very easy to fill. Then the top flips up for use &amp; closes nice &amp; tight, so no leaks! Another plus is that you can get the last bit out easily because you can squeeze the tube. A million times better than the usual, tiny, leaky, travel bottles. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these!</li>
    <li> I got a cheap set like this at Walmart, but the lids broke off the first trip I used them. So I got these. I though about more expensive ones, but these seemed solid. I just finished 10 day trip and these worked fine.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried traveling with these yet (if there is a problem I will write more) but so far so good! I received the exact colors as seen on the picture.</li>
    <li> These are PERFECT - couldn&#x27;t be happier with such a basic product.  They don&#x27;t leak, &amp;#34;3oz&amp;#34; is imprinted along the seam of each bottle for airplane travel, and I received the colored bottles as pictured.  I had some of the humangear bottles, but after reading all of the different products that couldn&#x27;t go in them, I decided to supplement those with this cheap set.  Good decision and saved a lot of money!</li>
    <li> These tubes are perfect for travel!!</li>
    <li> Works great for travel.  They area a healthy size for travel.  they don&#x27;t leak, stay sealed. It&#x27;s all good!  They are colored and came with pre printed labels such as shampoo, lotion etc and some blanks to use on the bottles. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I am traveling 3 weeks in Europe and looked everywhere for traveling bottles and tube. These are the best ones. They are very light and don&#x27;t waste space after usage (once the air is squeezed out, it takes less space). They do come in clear, mot in color like shown in picture though.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I received clear tubes instead of the colored tubes pictured. For me, it&#x27;s so much easier to associate color with a specific product since my shampoo, conditioner, soap, and face wash are all the same color and this was the main reason I purchased this product. I opened my package past the return date and haven&#x27;t used them so I cannot comment on their performance.</li>
    <li> Great set for a great price!!! I will definitely but this set again! Didn&#x27;t leak, was easy to fill, and was inexpensive!!</li>
    <li> I received all clear tubes and used them for homemade toothpaste. They worked great.</li>
    <li> Very useful, never leaked. Never had any problems with tsa. Very easy to fill up and reuse. Didn&#x27;t feel bad throwing a couple away at the end of my trip.</li>
    <li> I was considering the silicone travel tubes but having a hard time justifying the cost so I ordered these just to see what they were like. I&#x27;m glad I did; they&#x27;re good quality and the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Too big for the seasoned, minimalist traveler.  Also the sharp end edges will rip through your 311 travel bag.</li>
    <li> Originally was considering shelling out for Humangear&#x27;s very popular GoToobs but after seeing their non-compatible items list--apparently many popular and commonplace shampoos, sunscreens, lotions, and hair products react with the special silicone they&#x27;re made of--I decided to go with this set of simple plastic tubes.  I got two sets for a total of 8 tubes and they were perfect!  The tube shape ensured efficient space usage in the TSA-required 1-gallon Ziploc bag and I was able to fill them up with toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, sunscreen, facial moisturizer, shaving cream, and facial cleaner (Philosophy&#x27;s one-step Purity) with no leakage, easy fill, perfect dispensing, and no noticeable reactivity between the plastic of the tube and the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the prior reviewer noted, the tubes were clear rather than colored but that actually was a plus for me, since being able to see the contents helped me identify the contents more easily.  Only minor drawback--they provide a few pre-printed labels (conditioner, shampoo, lotion) and some blank labels; when using Sharpies on the blank labels, the ink tended to smear.  This was easily remedied however: I wrote directly on the tubes in permanent marker and those have yet to smear to this day.</li>
    <li> Took it with me through airport- size was perfect.  The tubes are actually pretty large, so I chose to only use two of them. One for conditioner and one for shampoo (did not leak). I think they would have lasted me almost a month.  I used smaller containers of other items to fill my quart-sized bag.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described tested and it is great  product !</li>
    <li> Used these to bring shampoo, hand soap, and the like with us on a trip recently. The openings are wide enough for thicker shampoos and such, but a bit big for thinner natural soaps like Dr. Bronners, which just runs right out and on to the counter, so you have be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smaller sizes for travel, and the ziploc-like bag they stow away in, just in case a bottle pops open during the flight. The different colors are nice. You can even skip using the included labels if you&#x27;re good at remember which color is which product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing the bottles out after the trip was a bit of work. Takes a while for all the reside to clear so that you can leave them to dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition for any traveller.These are just like the picture in 3 oz bottles for flying.The colors are very pretty.</li>
    <li> These are great! I bought some lower priced 3 oz containers at Wal-Mart but they were shaped in an hour glass so it was hard to get all of the product out. (When its not a whole lot to begin with!). I LOVE these. I bought two sets for good measure. I work for an airline and travel for leisure often. Every time I&#x27;ve pulled these someone asks me where I got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is functional, exactly as described, and GREAT for travel, even comes in its own quart sized zip lock plastic bag. (although i accidentally pulled off the zipper trying to close it when I tried jamming a bunch of stuff in with them)</li>
    <li> I was looking for containers that could be packed in my carry-on baggage for an overseas trip and these met the challenge.  I didn&#x27;t need to put these in a Zip-Loc as a clear, reusable bag was provided.  I filled one with conditioner, another with lotion, and the remaining two with a thin, liquid, castile soap and there was no leaking in any of the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciated that the bottles were different colors which made grabbing the right one in the shower a breeze.  The closure on the bag is not great and is prone to breaking but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer bought these for the plastic case they come in.  My  broke the first time I used it, so a Ziploc was a great substitute.  The bottles are very easy to squeeze, inexpensive, and did not leak so I will be using them for future trips.</li>
    <li> So far these haven&#x27;t broken or leaked.  I just wished there were more products like this!  I&#x27;m constantly leaving mine at the gym or on vacation.  Perhaps I should buy 5 sets next time.</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time during my last trip to Hungary - three weeks. Each bottle held enough for 21 days of face wash and foot cream, and they were very easy to use in the shower. They have flip-top caps, which I prefer over the type where you push the top in and the other side has a little hole. The ones I received were all clear, but that was fine - I write on them with a Sharpie, which works well, too.</li>
    <li> The zippered pouch is essentially worthless (I threw mine out!) but the 4 bottles are great. Flexible, colorful, and sturdy. They&#x27;ve held up well so far. The included labels are nice too, although you really need to hold the label down in place for a while before it sticks.</li>
    <li> These tubes have been great over my last year of travels! I took them on multiple airplanes, buses, trains, etc, and they never once leaked. I did my fair share of research in the review sections before I finally chose this product and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m currently using these bottles for a second year abroad and they&#x27;re still fantastic. I use them for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion and they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite travel tubes!  They are well made and work as described!  They are all clear though, which didn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
    <li> These are great. They are easy to fill, cool colors, come in a nice resealable bag. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> everything okay, thanks a lot</li>
    <li> These are more flexible than some I&#x27;ve seen and worked very well for my last trip.  They sealed tightly and did not leak. It was easy to get the contents (sun lotion and bug lotion in this case) out for use.</li>
    <li> got here fast, way useful for travel, and going to gym. I like the colors.</li>
    <li> Labels don&#x27;t stick for long. After 1 use in shower, they were off</li>
    <li> these are great, ease to fill and open/close. I love that they came with pre printed labels too.</li>
    <li> These bottles are great. I use them for making homemade lotions. They are durable and have a tight seal. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Felt cheap and hard to load b/c don&#x27;t have wide mouths</li>
    <li> Good for traveling and also too when I mix my oils together.</li>
    <li> These bottles made it through a round trip to China, 4 flights in China, and a round trip to San Francisco without leaking out in the quart baggie; unlike my previous stiff plastic bottles. The pop-up lids seem to seal well and the screw caps seal nicely so far. Being soft, they don&#x27;t want to leak as eagerly as the hard plastic bottles because they can flex more with the pressure changes and stuffed luggage they&#x27;re placed in. I just wrote on them with permanent marker, rather than using the paper stickers that came with them.</li>
    <li> The outer plastic container for the tubes is cheap and I don&#x27;t use it, put the tubes in a Ziplock bag instead.  The tubes are fine, which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Please note you will receive clear bottles.  I&#x27;m definitely okay with this because it&#x27;s easy to see what&#x27;s in them.  The labels come off easily so I highly suggest labeling them in sharpie, directly onto the bottles.  I got these for my hospital labor bag and they were super easy to fill.  No leaks yet.</li>
    <li> My first choice was the Goo-tubes, but upon reading the reviews - this set was rated better and more cost effective.  Will purchase more.  It even comes with labels, kudos to Mon Image...</li>
    <li> Nice for going through airports</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be multicoloured even if not as featured in the picture but I got boring plain clear tubes. Not happy</li>
