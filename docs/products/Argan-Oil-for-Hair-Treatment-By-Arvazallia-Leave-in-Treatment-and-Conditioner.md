<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this only once but it is fantastic!! My hair is super soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> didnt seem to do anything exceptional. Just plain oil, not worth the price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. This is her second bottle. She loves the product and even I notice that her hair is more softer and shiny. She uses this to protect her hair from her flat iron.The only complaint would be the size of the bottle vs cost...but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people that say it doesn&#x27;t grease your hands... well ...Still greasy in your hands. Not as much but still there.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and how it interacts with my hair; it is a bit pricy, so look for a sale when buying.</li>
    <li> I love this 100%.  I love all your products.  They smell good and they make my hair feel really good and strong.  I love, no complaints and yes I will continue to use all their products.  the only downfall it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! I have Caucasian hair type very thick, long, and normally have a lot of trouble with knots/tangling. I have been using this product for around 2 weeks but even with the first use AMAZING results. My dead ends almost feel non-existent. I feel like my hair is protected even with the damaging heat of the blow dryer. My tangled hair I can now run my fingers through, the entire day. My hair smells great, looks great and even feels super soft! They send you an email with tips for how you can use it, which is now a part of my hair regimen. They also sent me a $4 coupon, but its already amazingly inexpensive! I ABSOLUTELY looovveeee this stuff, and even though it doesn&#x27;t seem like I will be running out any time soon, I will be ordering more! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Much better than the coconut oil I was using (it left my hair feeling oily). Seller was great. I would definitely buy again.  I&#x27;m forced to update this review.  They must have changed the formula or something.  This is my third bottle.  It came in the normal box sealed in plastic I&#x27;ve it usually does and it looks the same.  But it has a smell to it,  is thinner,  the color is darker and more of it is required to do the same job.  Not happy with this bottle.  Why would you change a successful recipe while price remains the same? It&#x27;s idiotic.  It smells and feels like a different product.  Unexpected. The seller gave me back the money I spent even though I didn&#x27;t ask for it. As they have done such a very good job, I have increased my rating. I won&#x27;t buy Arvazallia again, however. If they have changed their product, then I don&#x27;t want it. Which is a pity. It really was very good until they changed it.</li>
    <li> Very soft argan oil, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too heavy after applying it. Great to use when using any heat activating device on your hair.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time as promised. I have long hair, nearly to waist but not thick just frizzy, use about 1/2 tsp in wet hair after shower and hair is smooth. Seems to take away some body, but hair feels great and healthy. Does not style as well as it used to, heat set waves tend to not set well and/or fall out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Acceptably pleasant smell, dissipates quickly so is not annoying.</li>
    <li> Okay so first off, my husband likes to put this in his beard haha but honestly this helped my hair so much. It repaired the split ends and my hair is so dry, I have to put some type of oil in it daily and I thought I would try this and I will continue to use this because it&#x27;s AMAZING. It smells like a warm sugary scent and it repairs and protects your hair. So happy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! amazing</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. It smells awesome; light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> My Argan Oil came wrapped very securely. The box was inside plastic shrink wrap, the bottle inside the box was wrapped in bubble wrap, and the bottle itself was also in plastic shrink wrap. Needless to say it arrived in perfect condition. The oil itself felt light unlike a previous oil I have used. My hair is very thick and styled in very small locks (dread locks that look more like small braids, sister locks). I would not recommend Argan oil for people with thin hair after all, it is an oil and the purpose is to sink into the hair and provide nourishment. With thin hair it is just going to be too oily. But for thick hair that needs moisture and nourishment, this works very well. It makes my hair soft and shiny. The smell is also very light, almost non existent. Even with thick hair, below shoulder length It didn&#x27;t take a lot to cover my hair so a little goes a long way. I will order this again although it will take a while to use the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible. No build up. Non oily. Defrizzes. Anti humidity . Incredible hair product!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> i got this product for free for a product review&lt;br /&gt;I tried this but i did not really care for it because it made my hair really greasy and my hair is not normally greasy that easily. so i would not use it again.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair detangled, soft, with great aroma and natural shine.  I also purchased the Arvazallia cream conditioner, an added bonus to my hair regimen, exceptional results.</li>
    <li> Oh lovely leaves my hair soft and would definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> love this product. I feel happier after using it. It makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Now for those ladies who can&#x27;t live without their Argan Oil (yes, I do mean me) and could use an extra boost of nutrients and hair protection there&#x27;s the phenomenal Arvazallia Argan Oil Hair Treatment: Leave in Treatment &amp; Conditioner. Whether you have straight, wavy, curly or hair that&#x27;s somewhere-in-between this Arvazallia Argan Oil works wonders. It&#x27;s instantly transforms your hair making it soft, silky and easy to manage. I can&#x27;t tell you how much we love it in my home, I&#x27;m thinking we need to start buying in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil Hair Treatment works best when combined with the other Arvazallia hair care products, but don&#x27;t fret ladies-- it also works great on it&#x27;s own.I&#x27;m so impressed with Arvazallia&#x27;s line of hair care products, they&#x27;ve not only worked wonders on my hair but have even helped me care for my daughter&#x27;s gorgeous curls. These products are so amazing and I really can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection with the rest of their products. It&#x27;s official, I&#x27;m obsessed with the shine, fullness and softness of my and my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to read my full review visit my blog meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given the products in this post for the purpose of a review. I was not paid in any way to write this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I like this very much. It has a pretty good smell and my hair is the softest I ever remembered it to be. I put about 4 pumps in my hand and rub, than rub it in my scalp and hair. Right now I have very short hair. My hair is not sticky or oily at all. Just soft and shinny!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Received it fast!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Makes my hair silky smooth and smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I love hair oils. They are definitely my favorite thing to use for my dry blonde hair. Arvazallia Premium Argan Oil Hair Treatment gives my hair enough moisture and hydration, and make it look soft, silky and shiny without weighing down the hair or leaving any sort of residue. It also smells amazing and calms down the stubborn top frizzy layer of my hair. Arvazallia Premium Argan Oil Hair Treatment does more than a great job detangling my hair and making it look smooth and manageable again. It will also work great for untangling wigs and hair extensions. I feel that Arvazallia Premium Argan Oil Hair Treatment could solve any hair problem and I highly recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;PR Sample. All opinions are my own and 100% honest</li>
    <li> This stuff smells SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good. I would use it just to add fragrance to my hair! Of course it also does wonders for smoothing out frizz and moisturizing my hair as well :)</li>
    <li> Its very very nice..I like it...it smells good..it makes my hair smooth and shiny without stickyness :)..</li>
    <li> My hair is so frizzy...have tried so many products...this is the best so far...keeps my hair frizz free and adds healthy shine to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for hair.  Keep hair shinny and silky.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is my new &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; hair product!  OMG, read the reviews but was still skeptical.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING else and my hair still looked awful until this oil!  Holy cow, what a difference thank you!</li>
    <li> This treatment does a great job of making my hair smooth and tames fly always. Using three pumps on my bra length straight hair when wet is the right amount for me. To find the right amount, I started with one pump and added one pump each day until I got a result that was too limp, and then dialed it back one pump. For those who complained that argan oil wasn&#x27;t the primary ingredient, they haven&#x27;t tried 100% argan oil on their hair yet! You really need a blend that is designed for use on hair.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and so far I have no complaints I&#x27;m just pacing myself to see the changes that will hopefully occur.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I had very damaged hair, from dying it a lot and honestly from a bad perm job. I hated my hair and was ready to chop all of it off. But I came across this argon oil and the reveiws were good so I said, &amp;#34;eh I&#x27;ll give it a shot&amp;#34;. After one use I could tell a big difference! The ends of my hair stopped breaking off! I love this stuff! A must buy for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy dry naturally wavy hair.  This product helps me to detangle it, cuts my blow drying time in half,and makes my hair shiny.  So happy I found it!  A bottle will last a long time .</li>
    <li> I won this item in a giveaway about 2 or 3 years ago when the company had a different name. It was a very light weight Argan oil which I loved for my hair as it was permed at the time. I am now coming close to a year of being natural, I decided to purchase this item again since I loved it the first time. The oil is now just a little thicker which is good &amp; I love it for my thick hair. Arvazallia is the best and is definitely for all hair types. I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TILL NEW PRODUCTS COME OUT.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product, it is not greasy and leaves your hair smelling good.  I would recommend this product to everybody!</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair but a lot of it and I love this oil to put on ends before I go to bed and a little on the ends in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Hair feels great after putting this on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many argan Moroccan oil. But this one is the best. It&#x27;s not oily and it won&#x27;t weigh down your hair and I have a very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia is absolutely lovely.It has a perfume scent which for some can be over powering.Most of the scent wears off rather quickly.I have fine hair so I don&#x27;t use much.In the winter I use it on my ends and it works well.I don&#x27;t experience any split ends or breakage.It also makes my hair color look more vibrant.You get an ample amount in the bottle which last a good amount time.With all that being said, I hide it from my mother because I know she would use it every chance she gets. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is much less frizzy and dry. I love the feel and smell of this oil. Absorbs and does not make my hair oily or limp. I use with the deep conditioner which smells amazing and makes my hair feel like silk! Will definitely purchase again. I am also very impressed by the company&#x27;s customer service.</li>
    <li> So, far this is the hair product I&#x27;ve liked.  My hair does feel softer and a little more manageable.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it very often, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll stick to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair is softer and my curls more defined. I can&#x27;t get enough. I&#x27;m also buying it for my mother.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It leaves the hair smooth silky and shiny :) plus it smells really good. Would recomend it :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these products from Arvazallia. The older I get the more difficult it is to tame my gray natural curly hair. I was looking for yet another solution for the frizzy dry mess that my hair has become. I come across the Arvazallia products here on Amazon. What a transformation my hair has gone through. I live in Houston Metro, only 3.5 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. I have problems with humidity year around. So I walk around looking like someone wearing a 1970&#x27;s Afro. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wore my hair pretty much that way through the disco era. But I want my hair to be curly not frizzy with that blown out look. These products have allowed me to pretty much achieve the natural curly look. I have embraced my curliness ignoring hair straighteners, and going with hair that looks healthy. Thank you Arvazallia, for the follow up emails that show your company actually cares about my hair problems, with follow up tips to use your products effectively. The smell of the products have a warm spice smell that I absolutely love. Goodbye frizzy hair 😊</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing!!!!!.  My hairstylist casually mentioned that my hair was really dry (which I knew) so I went on a hunt to find something to help it.  This oil is the perfect fix!  I have thick, naturally curly, frizzy hair and in the winter, it takes a beating with the dry heat in my house.  After only a few uses (I only need to use it once a week), at the next visit to my hair stylist (and ever since I started using this oil), she has commented on how much healthier and shinier my hair has been!  She actually asked me the brand to inquire whether she should carry it in her salon!  I highly recommend this product for people with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I also bought the Arvazallia Argan mask, and these products are amazing! My hair is thick, dry, curly, and I like to color it, so taming frizz can be difficult. This is the first oil/serum I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy. It immediately made my hair softer, shinier, and less frizzy. I put it in my hair while still damp, and just air dry. It&#x27;s also very effective when applied to dry hair... adding more shine and softness without a greasy feel. If your hair is similar to mine, I recommend using both the mask and oil!</li>
    <li> My hair became healthy again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  Although mine did not come in a pretty little box or anything.  :(&lt;br /&gt;But, the product smells wonderful, and has helped with my split ends, &amp; dryness.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS argan oil it smells so good. I have thick curry hair (iam Mexican American) I have dry hair it keeps it hydrated sleek with shine. I put it on after I shower on my damp hair as my hair drys it keeps my hair frizz free for 2-3 days also great for when I straight my hair keeps my slpit ends not so dry an brittle love this GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Hair looked dry.</li>
    <li> has a light-pleasant smell; a little goes a long way; doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy at all! Happy buyer :)</li>
    <li> I have only used a few times but I do feel a difference in less frizz and softness I would&#x27;ve given a 4.5 if I could but I would give a 5 before a 4</li>
    <li> I  had my hair done at my hairdressers, I had to call and ask her what she put in my hair! My hair was so smooth and shiny I couldn&#x27;t believe it. She told me what she used. I couldn&#x27;t find the exact brand so I tried a couple of them. They were not great. I came across this argan oil, the price was right so I decided to give it a try. My hair was soft, shiny and smooth! Amazing!  A little goes a long way. I will buy this brand from now on:)</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect solution for my overly tortured hair ;)</li>
    <li> Gives a gud relief wn massaged into scalp...works well in moisturizing the scalp... luv it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for hair other than make it greasy and the product in question appears to have very harsh chemicals in it. Definitely not a pure argan oil brand. It&#x27;s relatively cheap in regards to quality compared to better known and higher quality brands which is probably why I didn&#x27;t like it. Also noticed, it&#x27;s made in China. Additionally, it appears that this brand has hired on a paid reviewers to keep this product rating at or above 4 stars, because if you look at some of the recent reviews or low rated reviews you will notice that there&#x27;s an abnormal amount about of people who are rating down the review itself. Purchase at your peril.</li>
    <li> i use it after takiong head bath and it makes my hair feel lively</li>
    <li> It was my first time using this product and I absolutely loved it! My hair is so dry &amp; lifeless that I had no solution for it until I found this product. Now I apply it to my damp hair after showering and when I finish blow drying my hair also. It creates a smooth finish to my hair and makes my hair stay in place (goodbye static &amp; baby hairs!) I definitely recommend this product to everyone regardless of your hair type. Trust me you will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;-Review written by wife</li>
    <li> Sometimes I do decide on a purchase based on reviews that I&#x27;ve read. This product was one of them. I have been using this oil for several weeks and I am pleased with the results. My hair was dry and breaking, and I came on Amazon shopping for something that would help me, and this did!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great!, it is light so it does not weigh my hair down and after a few weeks of use I have noticed a big difference in my hair! It is no longer breaking! Everyone around me have noticed the difference in my hair! Thanks for a great product, I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders especially if your hair on the dry course side. I will definitely buy more. Smells great and does great when using the flat iron.</li>
    <li> Awesome product , leaves my hair looking strong and healthy , plus it smells really good !</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I bleached my hair from black to make it a pretty light copper red and my hair was fried from it! This stuff is a miracle. I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I put it on my damp hair after my shower helps to comb through the tangles much faster. I tried putting it on my dry hair but it does better for me on damp.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is soft, shiny, and smells great without being heavy or making my hair look greasy!</li>
    <li> very good but it weighs down curls</li>
    <li> This oil is pretty darn great! It has a really nice smell. I use it after towel drying my hair for softness and heat protectant prior to blowdrying. Not only does it make my dry, bleached hair feel very silky, but it makes it smell SO good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a VERY generous amount, and am impressed that it never leaves my hair greasy. Not only do I use it before blowdrying, but after as well as my hair is still prone to being dry. This makes it MUCH more manageable, healthy and shiny looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very pretty and is excellent quality. Even though it&#x27;s glass I&#x27;ve accidentally dropped it several times (oily, slippery hands are the worst!) and it didn&#x27;t even break or crack on the tile.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light not heavier or oily</li>
    <li> Thank you so much to life and style. They took such good care of ne when Amazon failed. The products amazing. Thank you for taking the time to help me .</li>
    <li> The hair product search is finally over love this!</li>
    <li> I have had an extremely hard time growing my hair and since using this produc5 3 months ago I have experienced healthier and longer hair than I&#x27;ve ever had and it&#x27;s safe and organic no harmful additives thanks so much I&#x27;m so glad to see someone in the industry cares about the environment and us</li>
    <li> Makes your hair EXTREMELY soft with the first use. Non-greasy, tames frizz, softens and gives moisture to dry/split ends, can be applied to wet or dry hair. If applied to wet hair and left to air dry, it feels unbelievably soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my textured hair soft and manageable.  The scent is light and my hair does not feel weighed down.</li>
    <li> I really love this one the first day ill try and my hair can say thank you I love it ;) Im really crazy about my hair i dont mind expending money on my hair products and this is one of the best thing I did for my hair I love it</li>
    <li> It seems to be a decent product. I didn&#x27;t really noticed a significant change until after the 2nd use. My hair was very dry and brittle. Now my hair felt much softer and more manageable. I will post a follow up review once I have had a chance to use it a few more times.</li>
    <li> My wife says this argan oil hair treatment deserves 5 stars. I can see and feel that it makes her hair nice and soft and we both like it for her :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, for dry and frizzy hair. I have very coarse, Mediterranean hair, and whenever I put this in my hair, it emphasizes my natural curls, and gives it a more shiny, smooth appearance. Definitely a recommendation.</li>
    <li> Very good Product. Amazing for my Hair. I love what it has done for my locks!</li>
    <li> This works great as a pre-poo.  Nice smell and feel.</li>
    <li> Def not too greasy! It moisturizers and revives your hair!</li>
    <li> My hair get so smooth right after using it. The smell is acceptable compared to what I read in other review before. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s lightweight and smells really nice. I use it on my hair for heat protector and it works great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Best my hair has felt in a while! Not sticky or too thick, just right consistency! Leaves hair feeling and smelling great! Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I m using  this product for about  3 weeks, so far I like the Argan oil for hair treatment, Good product for good price, definitely I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Super product! I used it and found it works amazing!  It made my hair really smooth and silky! I love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Argan oil is so beneficial for your hair. It helps to hydrate, protect from heat and leave you with a shiny, healthy, glowing hair. I prefer to add this to my hair AFTER it&#x27;s dried to give it a nice shine and control the frizzy, flyaways.  And can I just say how amazing this packaging is? This bottle is so luxurious! *product provided for honest review*</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVEEE This product ! It smells AMAZING, i wish i had a perfume with that scent ! It&#x27;s really delicious, not fruity just very sensual and womanly. It leaves my hair feeling nice and soft and with a beautiful shine. It tames fly-aways and it isnt greasy. Just saying i have long thick relaxed hair so this product is really good for me. I use it as needed so my hair doesnt look too heavy with oil. Some reason i thought this was a spray bottle but its actually a pump. Was kinda hoping for a spray bottle so that the product would come out light and misty but its okay, its light anyway, just use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Bought this with the curl defining cream. Even though my hair wasn&#x27;t a fan of the cream, I believe that using the oil to seal would be great. So I&#x27;m hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks expensive and the contact feels the same. Very little comes out of each pump but that is because you don&#x27;t need much for each section. Some of the ingredients may not sit well with others but I&#x27;m not condemning it before I try to make it work for me.</li>
    <li> Will never buy another hair oil again! Fabulous</li>
    <li> Very good hair treatment for all dry and had frizzy hair.Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Light pretty smell, no heavy residue, does wonders to revive hair. Hair becomes shiny, soft and flexible</li>
    <li> Amazinggg buying again again again &amp;#60;3 i have very oily hair im scared to use most of hair oils to add shine and softness on my hair coz it gets more greacy but since im using this oil my hair doesnt get greacy, it feels so soft and shiny. leave my hair silky and healthy looking. recommended.</li>
    <li> I like how my hair feels with this product!</li>
    <li> Love it would be better if it didn&#x27;t smell like powder but I still love it</li>
    <li> Great smell and great product. Love it! Did wonders to my hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really softens gray hair and make my hair feel healthy.  I will purchase this product again</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair soft and it smells great!</li>
    <li> a little heavy for fine hair</li>
    <li> Not worth the hype, my hair is still stringy and frizzy!</li>
    <li> I like it! It makes my hair very soft. You will feel not soft at all when you apply this oil on your wet hair. However, my hair gets very soft after your hair completely dry! I will definetly buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. As I have aged I an noticing my hair is not as soft and manageable any more. I have been using this for about a month now and I love the results. My hair is so soft and without an oily residue.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for frizzy hair.  Wonderful smell</li>
    <li> It is wonderful. It really helps to detangle and smooth out broken ends.  I have tried many products that are very expensive, and like this the best.  It works with my regular spa shampoo and is better than straight Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have wavy frizzy color treated hair. This did absolutely nothing when I tried using it on wet/damp hair. This product works great for me when I use it on my dry hair - it tames the left over frizzies without making my hair greasy. It smells great and gives a nice shine. It works well when I wear my hair curly/wavy, I tried it on my straightned hair and did not have as good results - it poofed out.  I can&#x27;t really comment on any of this products claims other than eliminating frizz. For my hair, this product cannot be used alone - but it is definatly one in my arsenal of hair managability products.</li>
    <li> This is such a good product.  It smells lovely and although it is a little strong when you put it on, it quickly fades.  My hair feels softer and it is not greasy.  I think it will also last a while, it is a big, easy to pump bottle.  I think I found my new favorite hair oil!</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic, especially if used with Arvazallia Hair Mask. My daughter and I both use this product. We have seen a major difference in our hair. It is softer with body, plus our hair is starting to grow again. We leave in a very dry climate and this effects our hair. We have long hair and it continually breaks.this Argan Oil has stopped this. I can&#x27;t say enough about the advantage of using this oil. I am so thankful I found this oil.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Would definitely recommend.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a must have oil treatment, I love the way it makes my hair feel.Smell nice!!!!!</li>
    <li> Argan oil is just what I wanted for my hair as I straighten my hair twice a week. It is light weight and has a very good smell. I use it on my damp hair before air drying and straightening it. So far I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have long curly hair and have tried a few other products, but none make it feel as soft and smooth and the smell is heavenly!</li>
    <li> I have tried every hair product under the sun to make my colored/highlighted hair look &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; again.  It looks dried out &amp; almost like straw on the ends.  I use only salon (expensive) products but could not get my hair to look good.  For the past few years I&#x27;ve had this trouble (I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s) &amp; thought nothing would help.  This product &amp; the hair mask by Arvazallia have given me back my normal looking hair as well as softness, all without weighing it down.  I have only been using these products for about a week but they&#x27;ve already made a huge difference.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Amazing,it makes my hair looks wonderful</li>
    <li> first time I used.  it I had complements all day on how pretty my hair is. im over 60 with course longest hair I pretty. much let ing it go grey. after years of coloring. I did nothing specia that day with hair just washed and used this and the hair mask. I never get pretty hair complements. ever. was. surprised each time. really. I had changed from a very much higher priced. popular product. . you see my.  hair is course and frizzes. so tangles and. is about 24 inches long. mostly to save on salon cuts . I just braid it let it dry so no.  tangles and thought I was happy with other but never.  ever could I just finger comb it. very happy to.  hhave discoved this wonderful hair treatment.  a.it also smells wonderful. really happy and highly recommend it for any hair type. also have split ends from years of pulling combs and brushes through it and rubber bands etc. I would love to find the shampoo and conditioner to add on line havent found it yet. but this is my new forever product. even with out others comements. just. for the pure pleasure of using it. this was after the first use. had. to comment which I dont do. it wascrasy to get the hair complements too im not that woman with great hair at all.lol. anyway really you will love it. let me know where I can find. the shampoo and conditioner.  also I saved so much over my last product.  but my hair is.  just so difficult. thankyou.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I have recommended this product to several friends.</li>
    <li> The argan oil is a great product to use for my dry hair. I just love it!</li>
    <li> Great for hair.  Great oil and it smell very good!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She is extremely happy with the results of her hair after use.  I myself can definitely feel a difference in the texture of her hair. It is noticeably softer, healthier and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Awesome product ! ! Will buy again⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS...EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It works wonders on my hair. I put it on before I blow dry my hair and then some more after I am done to seal the styling. I say it has dual action: before the blow dry it acts as heat protection and after the blow dry, it acts as humidity protection. I have freeze layered long hair, half way my back, and a little on your hand goes a long way. I pump two times on my hand, rub it and put it on. I do this times six around my head then I proceed to blow dry my hair. At the end I use less, maybe one or two pumps on my hand.  I finish up by  passing my hand all over my hair making sure I get all the tips and I am ready to go. It is a good addition to my hair styling routine.</li>
    <li> the hair oil of the gods it honestly works buy it</li>
    <li> Bought this a couple weeks ago but pump wouldn&#x27;t work.  Contacted customer service and they sent me a brand new one and a bonus of their hair mask. I tried once and absolutely love it. My hair got so smooth and soft I couldn&#x27;t believe. Loved the mask. Add for the oil, I am  also pleased. It has a great smell and it leaves my soft without being greasy.  I still want to try a little longer, but very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Terrible Product!!! Love the conditioners but this one is going in the TRASH!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of toxins they put in here but I&#x27;ve been losing hair since using it. I use it strictly as directed by for some reason, I am losing a lot of hair. Also, read all reviews carefully as many of them look planted. It&#x27;s MADE IN CHINA and has a strong (a bit too much) fragrance. Sucks... big time.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It smells good also.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it smells beyond amazing</li>
    <li> Has the best smell leaves my hair looking beautiful..definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my hair hydrated, shiny and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using a different brand of argan oil in my hair for about 4 years now.  Due to the great reviews, I wanted to try this out.  I&#x27;m very happy and thankful that people take the time to review.  :)&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to just washed, damp hair and blew it dry.  I was very happy with the results!  My hair which is very thick, wavy and coarse, looked smooth, silky and pretty!  It&#x27;s hard keeping from touching it.  The ultimate test was walking in 85 degree heat with high humidity...  my hair didn&#x27;t frizz!  I really like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and flat like others have.  I hope this will always be available as I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> NOT SURE ? I AM USING IT TO PROTECT MY HAIR FROM FRIZZ WHEN I USE FLAT IRON&lt;br /&gt;BUT SINCE I STARTED IT- MY HAIR IS EVEN FRIZZIER SO I GUESS I&#x27;LL NEED NOT USE IT FIRST TO R/O IF IT IS THE PROB OR THE FLAT IRON MAY HAVE ALREADY DAMAGED MY HAIR???</li>
    <li> Good product don&#x27;t make your hair look oily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product for an awesome price. It makes the hair look shiny but not oily, which happens by most of these products.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells good and not too strong.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I am in my 40s now and while my hair is still maintaining its curl and it is very thick, it has started to get dryer and dryer. This oil works wonders to soften it up and keep it that way for a few days before I wash it again. You can use a little for touch-ups on dry hair as well. Another tip is to wash hair at night, put the oil on and wrap your head overnight - it is SO SOFT in the morning!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this oil and I plan to order it again. This oil makes my hair very soft. I actually got it for my self but my husband tried it for his scalp and my son wanted to try it too. Now, we&#x27;re all using it. I especially love the smell, it smells really good! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its promises.  I hope amazon carries it again. I use it on my hair and also mix it with my face moisturizer.  Great for gifting, also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with ArganEsque Argan Oil. I apply this product to my hair after every wash as a leave in conditioner. It makes my hair soft ,, easy to comb and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I received the order on time and seller is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I received this as a complimentary gift. Been using this for two weeks now, I absolutely love it! It does everything it says it does. Very impress! Leaves a great scent, controls frizz and a little goes a long way. I sometimes use the oil before I blow dry my hair, but mostly before I flat iron my hair, and 1 pump after styling it. It gives it enough shine and leaves hair silky smooth and soft. OH, biggest change since using this and the system itself, I had a great amount of new growth. Great product and WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! WORKS GREAT ON ALL TYPES OF HAIR! ( yes, I have relaxed hair)</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very silky.  Also works well on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days, but am pleased with the results thus far.  It goes on really smooth and is a great shine and conditioner for my natural hair.  It works best for me on damp hair.  I would have given it five stars, but I&#x27;m not to happy with the pump.  You only get a drop of oil with each pump so it&#x27;s sort or dribbling down my fingers...other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> Thank you! I love this oil!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love it!</li>
    <li> It works alright, but not really spectacular when it comes to taming frizz</li>
    <li> Does not leave your hair greasy</li>
    <li> Very nice and light texture. I used pure oil before but it made my hair feel greedy and was hard to apply. This applies easy and does not make my hair feel oily. Thanks</li>
    <li> If you have a black hair, this oil will makes it shine. It has a good smell and treats dry hair immediately</li>
    <li> The oil is good i appreciate it</li>
    <li> The scent is strong fragrance but I am ok with it. It make my hair soft to touch. This oil is very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even I have very fine/thin long hair. I use it 3 to 4 pumps and my hair is not greasy at all. I have just re-ordered 4 more bottles. An additional point is the after-sale service from this seller(Lyfe and Style Goods) is very good indeed. The promotional discount is really very tempting to buy a few more bottles to stock up. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by ArganEsque deserve a 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Love and hate. I end up having to use about 6 pumps for my chemically treated hair after shower. Then when it&#x27;s damp I do another 6 pumps. Other than that, I like them enough to repurchase.</li>
    <li> My beauty routine pretty much consists of whatever I can fit into as little time as possible these days. With an almost three year old, I do not have time to put a million different hair products in my hair or a million different devices to use on my hair. Yet I love to have my hair long and looking, nice, healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try out Arvazallia’s line of hair care products because they help you fall in love with your hair again by hydrating it to maximize and restore it to your hair’s original state. I decided to try out the Arvazallia Ultra Curl Defining Cream with Argan Oil and the Argan Oil for Hair Treatment and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This can be used in a great many of ways much like Argan oil itself, which I am a huge fan of. This is a premium salon treatment that instantly transforms your hair making it soft, silky and easier to manage. It repairs, restores and strengthens over-processed, damaged, and brittle hair. It can be used to eliminate frizz or to protect against heat products. Arvazallia Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Conditioner is great for dry scalp or hair and is made from Moroccan grade cosmetic argan oil and promotes natural hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing to use Arvazallia Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Conditioner for is to put into my hair for about twenty minutes before I get into the shower. I let it soak into my scalp and hair for about fifteen to twenty minutes and then I shampoo, condition and rinse out and my hair is silky smooth and easy to manage. I also like to use it as a finishing touch on all my hair styles. It works great to tame frizz and give that extra shine a boost.&lt;br /&gt;Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives Arvazallia Hair Care 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is very light and has  a great smell. The bottle is big so it will last for months. I have used it with my hair dried but will also use it after I shampoo as a moisturizer and to protect it when I blow dry and iron it. I will buy again and also buy for my mom and sister as Mother&#x27; Day gifts. Very happy with this purchase and will recommend to all my family, friends and my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Treatment along with the shampoo, conditioner and masque and I have fallen in love with all 4 products! I am fortunate in that I have pretty decent hair genetics and don&#x27;t have issues with thinning, over frizziness, etc so most hair products do not result in a difference visually or in texture. After using the shampoo, condition and treatment just one time, I could actually feel that my hair was silkier and shinier. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and am still fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! Leaves my hair very soft and shiny without the added oiliness. It also smells great which is a plus!</li>
    <li> This product has really made great improvements to my hair in terms of softness and manageability.  My hair is really curly and I usually blow it out which can make it super frizzy.  This stuff really calms it down without making it look greasy.  It also smells really good which is always a plus ( :</li>
    <li> I usually have very dry ends and the fact that I color it makes it worse. I&#x27;ve been applying it to the ends only with good results. I tried applying all over but then my part and roots were too oily. My only suggestion would be to slowly increase the amount you use until you find what is right for you.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shinya and soft!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars. Cheesy, I know, but true. I love this oil so much! My hair is fairly long - currently about halfway down my back - but pretty fine. Either because of these factors or genetics or maybe even karma, I always have split ends. Leave the hairdresser? Split ends. Style my hair? Split ends. Windy day? SPLIT. ENDS. So I wasn&#x27;t going to get my hopes up too much based on other reviews, but it was on sale so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. I am so glad I did! The difference it has made is in noticeable, was noticeable from the first use. My hair looks and feels healthier, is much less frizzy and staticky (thank you, winter), and styling is quicker and easier. I use it before drying my hair (about 3-4 pumps), then another pump or two concentrating on the ends before straightening, and sometimes one more when I&#x27;m done. Admittedly, that may be excessive, but my hair has been pretty damaged for a while. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for about a month, and even using it that frequently, the amount in the bottle has gone down about an inch. The company was much more invested in the sale than I expected, having followed up with me twice so far to see if I&#x27;m satisfied. Answer: a resounding yes. This is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I am so irritated. I just bought this and it tipped over on my counter and completely shattered. I had glass all over, oil all over, and my nearly $20 product was gone in less than a couple months. I had barely used any!!</li>
    <li> Light weight, smells nice, not greasy at all, makes it easy to comb through your hair leaving it soft and fun!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping on this product and I love it on my natural hair.  I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Being in an area with hard water and the surroundings are not that great this product could not have been more help to me. I love the way it smells and the way it has softened my hair. I love this product and will definitely order it again and I recommend it to all my friends and will recommend it to all the ladies that come to this specific area.</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome for the most part. It made hair easy to detangle. Made it soft and less frizzy. Not at smooth as I&#x27;d hoped though but I&#x27;m still going to buy another when I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different products for my hair, which is really dry and coarse. Nothing works like this product. I am so happy to have finally found something that makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have thin hair that likes to get frizzy as I age. This Argan Oil is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Nor looks greasy. It helps control the frizzy&#x27;s, leaving my hair nice and straight. It also has a nice fragrance once it is on the hair. This is a repeat purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hash hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells great and you don&#x27;t need to use much. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This has changed my life!  We live in Italy and the water here is particularly harsh on  . . . . . everything, but especially hair.  My hair was super stiff, damaged, and breaking.  I could tell a difference after one day.  After three, it was like I had an entirely new head of hair.  Easy to use, subtle smell that is pleasing, and amazing.  My hair is much healthier, much shinier and smoother, and very easy to handle.  I tell everyone moving to Napoli to get it as it is a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Very easy to use and love, love the price!! I would promote the product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Just received this product couple days back. It smells amazing and I love how it doesn&#x27;t feel thick but gives shine to the hair. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use this after I get out of the shower and again to refresh the ends after styling.</li>
    <li> This oil is excellent for your hair and leaves it feeling so silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing, as it being an, &amp;#34;Oil based leave in&amp;#34; I thought,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These types of conditioning usually are way too oily to actually leave in, and&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t really smell good, or at all.&amp;#34; This product is NOT at all like that.&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells, looks and feels awesome. You&#x27;ll have to try it to believe it! ?&lt;br /&gt;Trust me buy it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. I use it before going to sleep at night. Keeps my hair soft and unfrizzy.</li>
    <li> This is my best purchase in life ever!</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! It smells great and really absorbs well into my hair without making it greasy. It does help with detangling as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will buy again!  12/3/15 - I purchased this oil again because it is so great for my hair.  I use it every time I wash my hair and it makes my hair so much more manageable.  It even breaks less.</li>
    <li> My new superstar tool to help manage unruly hair!  Even with curly, dry hair, only need a drop about the size of a pea.  Mixed in with the styling cream and my curls are soft, non-frizzy.  Am going to mix some in with their hair mask as recommended.  The smell is a little strong, but fades before too long.</li>
    <li> I have recently moved and have well water now.  The well water was destroying my hair causing it to be dull and frizzy. The Argan Oil has changed my hair.  It is so easy to straighten now and stays so soft and silky.  The only thing is you cannot use more than 2 or 3 drops or your hair will get really oily.  A little goes a long way with this.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and the softens my hair  very well.. would recommend and buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love it!!! Leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> great product, great service, thank you</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much I had to order it again. My hair  feels and smells absolutely amazing. I use it as a hot oil  treatment and as a regular hair oil. This is worth the money and it lasts  you very long.</li>
    <li> This is amazing oil. The scent is devine, and lasts for a long time. This oil is not heavy or leaves my hair feeling greasy. I use this everyday and have found a new go to product for oil.</li>
    <li> My wife tells me this oil makes her hair feel silky and smooth. She has slightly wavy hair and it gets frizzy in humid weather. Using this oil keeps it smooth and she says it feels very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service for this company is excellent. I had a problem with the bottle and they sent me a replacement immediately which took 1 day to arrive. You cant go wrong, give it a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well to tame my frizzies.  I have to use at least  pumps for my shoulder length thick hair.  Do be careful not to use to much though as it will make your hair look a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE OIL SOO MUCH THX.</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil treatment made my hair so soft. This product really works!!! The product smell amazing. I will definitely be buying Argan Oil treatment again.</li>
    <li> I have mid back length locks and had been looking for an oil that would help with my dry scalp. While I have only had this product for less than a week, the difference between this and other products I&#x27;ve tried is night and day!!! My scalp feels great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dry scalp (or eczema) since I began using it!! In just over a week, I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of this stuff!!</li>
    <li> It has a very nice smell, once applied to your hair, it becomes a wonderful clean scent, my hair is 31 inches long, so the scent of products are very important to me. I suggest rubbing it on your palms, then apply it to your hair. It tames fly aways and split ends, as well as making your hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially gave this oil 3 stars because the oil was spilled all over the bottle and inside the box..To my surprize, and as you can see below, their customer service contacted ME via Amazon and sent me a new bottle! I was shocked when it showed up at my door, I just couldn&#x27;t believe it. I didn&#x27;t ask for a refund or a replacement, they took it upon themselves to do so. I&#x27;m happy to say, not a drop of oil was spilled. :) I would have ordered it again, just because it works and I love the smell, but now..they have a customer for life, and I&#x27;m looking into the other products they sell!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing leave in treatment. I use it now every 2weeks after doing deep condition treatment from the same brand. Leaves my hair soft and manageble.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling so soft and smells delicious! Also makes it shine like crazy!! Love this product! Will order again soon!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have thick curly hair and it makes me hair feel silky and look shiny.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Leaves my blonde highlighted hair silky, shiny and does repair repeated flat iron use.  The only con is the containers the shampoo and conditioner come in.  Hard to get the product out.  I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! It&#x27;s been the only thing that keeps my hair moisturizer all day. Great product.</li>
    <li> Had very dry hair from coloring, was told to try this, really helped my hair recover! Fast delivery, great size. Great product</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use Aegean oil and I see the effect on my hair very smooth and shiny I recommend all the products for hair from this company</li>
    <li> Its a great product my thick curly damage hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have had the chance to use the Argan Oil for Hair for a couple of weeks now!  I am Amazed. I am 67 and have my hair professionally colored which is really harsh on hair. This oil has made my hair feel as soft as a babies!  I have been telling all of my girlfriends about this wonderful product. I will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky smooth doesn&#x27;t leave it all greasy and leaves a shine in the hair for hours (use it for my girlfriend and 7yr old daughter)</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for over 6 months now for both my daughter and myself.  I am very impressed with this product and will continue to order it through Amazon.  I have very long, thick, wavy hair and I put this product on my hair after towel drying and let air dry.  My natural waves look awesome with this product and my hair is silky smooth with a great shine to it.  I always have people asking what product I use in my hair, and this is what i attribute the great look to.  My daughter has shoulder length very thick coarse hair and this works awesome as well.  It is not a heavy, greasy oil and the smell is nice.  This product comes in an easy to use glass pump bottle and I have had no problems with this item arriving safe in the mail.  When the product is running low, you can easily unscrew the top to finish using the product in the bottle.  Great price, great product, and free shipping!</li>
    <li> Really good. Keeps the hair some and untangled.</li>
    <li> This is SERIOUSLY the best Argan oil out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all, it truly&lt;br /&gt;is a miracle! My hair WAS a dry frizzy mess, now omg my hair feels like hair&lt;br /&gt;again lol. This is the ONLY product you need period! Plus the customer service&lt;br /&gt;is outstanding! I received my bottle cracked, not only did they replace it they&lt;br /&gt;replaced it with the larger size bottle! Love!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry fly away hair and nothing helped make it feel soft and manageable.  This does the trick and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> I find that it calms my dry hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take much...a few drops after shampooing.  I have also tried it on dry hair before sleeping.</li>
    <li> I love this product as a compliment to the Avazallia hair mask.  It gives super duper shine without weighing my hair down and it smells absolutely divine.  Also, it helps with manageability in terms of giving staying power to my curls when I iron them in.  The bottle is beautiful too...made of glass.  I just LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> smells nice, but not much difference in appearance of hair</li>
    <li> This product is great. Leaves your hair soft, glossy, and not greasy. I would defiantly recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy thin hair and this works wonders for me. I use this 3 times a week, my hair has a healthier look and shine. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say, everything already said by reviewers. This is the best product I ever use and highly recommend to everyone. I am very happy with this Argan Oil so my hair : )</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smelling amazing! And soft!</li>
    <li> Best hair treatment I have ever used! Smells great, makes my hair soft, manageable and not greasy. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent , I like it!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft, not weighed down, and smooth. It smells nice too, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair. Highly recommend and you really get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helped me realize that my hair was horribly dry and lifeless. After just one week of using it daily, my hair feels softer and silkier. It looks healthier. Also, this hair oil smells nice and feels great. Love it!</li>
    <li> Used it the very first day and loved what it did to my hair. Very happy with the ArganEsque Moroccan Oil. It has changed the texture of my hair from being very dry to quite silky. In fact, I now put it in my hair after it is washed and do not have to repeat an application till I wash it again. My hair never becomes dry like before. I still can&#x27;t believe it! Would highly recommend this product,</li>
    <li> The product was as described and worked very well on my exceeding dry hair. It gave it managibility and a little shine.</li>
    <li> I live at over 9,000 ft. - though it is dry vs. the frizz of sea level - curly hair still needs something and this is it! Hair looks and feels healthy without flyaways.</li>
    <li> During the winter my hair is always so dry...this oil really assists dry hair and scalp. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and had it permed in order to get some body. I ended up with frizzy dry hair. Received this bottle of Argan oil yesterday. Put some on my hair soon as I opened it. Took a shower last night and washed my hair, then added some more of the oil. This morning I have beautiful shiny hair with no frizzies and lots of body. I ran right over to Amazon to order another bottle but unfortunately it isn&#x27;t available now. You can bet that if it comes back in stock, I&#x27;ll be stocking up!</li>
    <li> when i first got this in the mail i was a little bit skeptical because its Made In China.  I am very pre-cautious when i put anything in my hair and always prefer made in the US.  But i decided to give it a try (too much hassle to sent it back) so here is my 2 cents on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair Type: Thick, Long, and just recently bleach (i got a blonde ombre)&lt;br /&gt;Hair Condition before using this: After bleaching my hair became really dry and hard.&lt;br /&gt;Hair After Using this: Let me begin to say, I am completely shock and in love with this product.  It is amazing you guys! Most of all it does work! After using this products about 3x a day ( morning, mid-afternoon, and night ) my bleach hair became a lot softer in texture. (again if anyone has bleach hair i recommend this product and i recommend using it 3x a day. make sure u section your hair out so is evenly distribute among your dry hair. I use 2-3 pumps every time ~avoiding my roots! Another thing i love about this product is the smell! It smell amazing! and the best of all the smell does lock into your hair so throughout the day you will still smell this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do give this a try don&#x27;t be discourage about where its made because in the end it truly does work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got shoulder length naturally curly/frizzy hair that gets colored. The application of color, even just to the roots, leaves my hair looking and feeling dry and coarse. I&#x27;ve used plenty of products with varying results to tame the frizz and only wash my hair every other day. Other than using a blow dryer on my bangs, the rest of my hair dries naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearing a greasy look, I started off just using a couple of pumps and have since graduated to 6 or 7 pumps per application. My curls are better defined, the frizz has been cut by about 90%, my hair feels soft and one thing I absolutely love is that I&#x27;m practically tangle-free. Even on day two I only need to finger comb my hair. 7-8 pumps is needed to tame the frizz on a humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it damp hair, it also works as a de-tangler; one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for about 4 months now, using it every other day.  Have just under half a bottle left and have already re-ordered, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
    <li> Great product and smells sooooo good. The quality of this oil is by far the best I have used! This company stands behind their product and contacted me to ensure that I was satisfied!!! WOW! Only a few companies do this these days and this is one them. Thanks for the great oil and experience!</li>
    <li> My hair looks like I got a blow out everyday when I use this product!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My hair has been dry.  Living in 110 plus degree heat right now.  It feels so soft after using.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for close to a month.I love it and it takes a very small amount for my hair to look ready for the day.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> this item smells so nice, the bottle is very nice too. it&#x27;s not too greasy. this will last a long time. every time i see some dryness, this helps instantly. it gives the shine without wearing your hair down. good stuff.</li>
    <li> This oil is mostly silicones and argan oil is one of the last ingredients. I had better results with pure argan oil than this. And this stuff has a horrible smell! Hate it.</li>
    <li> I have medium curly hair and I use this product before drying (diffusing) my hair and after its dry for any frizzies. Also great to reactivate curl for second day hair. Also smells wonderful and I think the bottle will last forever</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has very curly hair. She uses a flat iron everyday. I have tried many different products on her hair to try to prevent her hair from getting dried out. This oil works great</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair.  Lately, my hair became very dry and not healthy.  I tried everything, natural oil masks, expensive saloon treatments, etc...and nothing seemed to be working.&lt;br /&gt;I finally saw this oil and read the reviews,  I then decided that I will order a bottle.  Why not with this cheap price!  I did not think that I will have the answer to all my hair problems.  This Oil makes my hair silky and manageable ALL DAY.  At the beginning, I thought that the smell is strong, but it is not overwhelming.  I like the smell now.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the bottle is big so the oil will last long,  it&#x27;s a steal in this price.  I just bought two more bottles.  I am in love with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Arvazallia hair oil works very well for me. I have very dry curly/frizzy hair and 3 drops of this oil makes all the difference in how managable and soft my hair is. I just rub it on my hands and then work it into wet hair. Let it air dry and my hair is soft and curly with very little frizz! No chemical feel or heaviness.</li>
    <li> This really works well. My hair is quite happy.  I have had dry hair for years, thanks to a medical condition, and have used a lot of conditioners.  But this one actually nourishes my hair and makes it feel great.</li>
    <li> Great hair product! I had dry, over processed hair. After using argan oil my hair feels healthy and is very smooth. No need to use hair straightening iron anymore. It also has a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  I have very curly and often very frizzy hair.  This helped calm the frizz and kept my hair moisturized even after drying.</li>
    <li> Out of the many oil products I&#x27;ve tried, I like this best. When I apply it on my towel dried hair and than use the comb and the dryer to straiten my hair, my hair gets a nice shine and it&#x27;s tamed down. No other oil does that for me. I also like to add it to my finished hairstyles, to add more definition or tame my hair down. It&#x27;s probably my 4th bottle. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have below the shoulders fine, color-treated hair and I use 4 pumps of this worked though the lengths and ends of my hair after I get out of the shower. My hair looks and feels so great and so healthy when I use this oil. I ordered it because of the crazy good reviews, but I did not have high hopes for this product (most hair products do not live up to their claims with my hair). This stuff blew me away. You should absolutely 100% order this product now. It is the best product I use on my hair- and I have used so many different products (Alterna, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Terax, Healthy Sexy Hair, drug store brands like L&#x27;Oreal, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, and many more). By the way, I still layer on my other hair products (heat protectant, volumizer, sometimes anti-frizz spray or beach spray) and there&#x27;s no issues with my hair being weighed down or anything like that. This is a high quality product for a great price.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didnt give this a five is because of the smell. It&#x27;s just to strong for me. But, other than that, let me tell you, if your looking for something to get your hair to grow back in, this is it!! I put this oil on my scalp ,massaged , my hair grew back!</li>
    <li> Great product love hair my hair feels after one application.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It smells great and it super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all. It has made my hair super shiny and soft and mends the split ends and tames frizzies. It&#x27;s well worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down and leave hair smooth along with the mask. I recommend using both for BEST results. can use just one but I like the combination.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. I use it, and my hair becomes bouncy and fuller in an instant! Not to mention the smell... Simply heavenly.</li>
    <li> This product does not fall short, I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Stinks. Was in the sun a day and lost the color (probably doesn&#x27;t work now)</li>
    <li> Amazing product, from the smell to the texture, it is fantastic!!! Leaves my hair so smooth and shiny and I have frizzy thick hair. I was worry that the smell was going to be too strong(from other reviews) and I can not stand strong smells, but the fragance that the oil has is very delicate, my husband absolutely loves how it makes my hair smell.Will totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received it free to test and share my honest opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I really like the smell. Secondly, I like this leave in treatment! Because of this treatment, my hair is softer and the ends are not tangled after hours like usual. It also gives it a nice shine. One thing to point out that&#x27;s really important is, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair. My hair still feels as if I just washed it, so there&#x27;s no oily residue to complain about. I will be buying another when this finishes because it&#x27;s better than using &amp;#34;shine spray&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Terrific product is great for dry hair. I apply about 4-5 pumps to my almost waist-long hair. Works great, never greasy!</li>
    <li> I love it,  my hair is damaged,  and this product is recovering it,  my hair is more healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading all the great reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair at all, terrible cheap perfume smell</li>
    <li> It makes the hair soft and it&#x27;s smell is awesume. It still not decrease the fuzzy hair, but  love it.</li>
    <li> great product.  works as advertised. hair feels clean and manageable after using it daily.  recommend for anyone who has had dry scalp or flaking as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product. leaves my hair shinny and protects from daily hair drying and straightener  . 5TH TIME I buy it and will continue buying it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrives very fast every time I buy it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. First time I used it I got exactly the results I wanted. I have been looking for a product like this for a long time. Smooth silky shiny hair .... no fuss no muss.</li>
    <li> My only criticism is the packaging for the Argaon Oil.  It is difficult to pump the liquid out the glass container.  It would be better if the Argan oil ws in a plastic bottle with a spray nozzle.</li>
    <li> Very good product, my hair is improving the first time I used it. My dry, frizzy dull hair is much better now, my coworker asked what I did to my hair.</li>
    <li> Only after 4-5 uses my hair is getting brownish from dark black...i hate it..</li>
    <li> Not greasy or sticky at all. Keeps my hair nice and soft and adds life back to dull, dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second time repurchasing this item. It has made such a difference in my hair.. Thank you for creating a wonderful product :) it works on my sensitive scalp and leaves my hair shiny, bouncy and full of life !!!</li>
    <li> Nice and light non sticky hair oil. Ideal for daily usage . I have been using it for a while now and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Very strong perfumey smell. Will not use again.</li>
    <li> The product is good for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on wet or dry hair.A little&lt;br /&gt;goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but I have used silicone products in the past, with over time they leave my hair dry.  I found using your product my hair felt light, full of bounce the first two times, then my next time my hair was full of static like I have never experienced before.  I haven&#x27;t used it since, maybe I will uses during the humid summers occasionally.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring (highlights etc...) my hair since I was 20, I am 48 so it&#x27;s been awhile.  I&#x27;ve just added blonde highlights to my hair and the highlighted areas were very dry or hay like.  I have tried high-end products and every conditioner under the sun but have never had results like this with an over the counter product or even a professional product.  I bought the oil to replace my biosilk at my stylist&#x27;s suggestion, I was so excited when I got the product and read it could also be used to repair damaged hair as well, so I tried it.  I applied it to my hair for a couple of hours and then washed my hair and applied a couple of pumps (fine hair and don&#x27;t have volume so I didn&#x27;t want to over apply) to my regular products and let my hair air dry overnight.  I was AMAZED my hair normally dries and looks frizzy due to color processing, my hair looked healthy, supple, and was soft even where my highlights were, the texture was not like my regular hair but the texture improved overnight, my daughter asked me what I had used!!!!  I am a believer and will continue to use this product.  Thank you for the other reviews that were posted and convinced me to at least try the product, I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have blond naturally curly and frizzy hair. I was very surprised how well this softens my curls and controls the frizziness!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia makes hair smell awesome. And for me, unfortunately that is all it does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week, and I can see a difference in hair: it seems thicker and has more volume. I put this on every other day, and it is doing wonders. The pump also doesn&#x27;t give out a lot of the product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It is the best among all the argan oils that i have tried. It straighten my hair without ironing it, leaves my hair soft and silky, and hair smells fresh everyday..</li>
    <li> I like this product and the smell is nice too! I would reorder this product again . Be careful with glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the mask for 2 weeks now. I do the 30 mins treatment and use it before I blow dry my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and smells great! I feel the hair more soft and shinny. Just waiting to see the biggest results after sticking to the treatment for a month!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, not greasy at all. Excellent customer service! They contacted me to make sure I was happy with my product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling very soft and smells great too.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or look, nothing but beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> I recently had a nightmare of a hair episode where I had to strip, bleach, and dye my hair back in to submission and my hair was totally thin, scraggly, and wrecked. This argan oil has been a god send. I have thin, semi oily hair white-girl hair and this did not make my head too oily. I just squirted a couple pumps in to my palms and applied to hair as directed and it has made my overly processed hair soft and beautiful again. I highly recommend. Also, it came tightly wrapped in plastic and shipping was right on time.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for your hair. it leaves it silkie and no frizz or fly away hairs. you can use this wet hair or dry hair. everyone should try this  product its great. and you receive it packaged good and in ts quick shipping  k.m.e</li>
    <li> This product is just OK. I am not big into perfumy things and this is definitely perfumy, but not an intolerable smell. It just sort of tames my hair, but I will say it does not make it greasy at all, which I appreciate. Not sure if I would buy it again, but it is not terrible.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Not oily so doesn&#x27;t weight down hair. I have thin color-damaged hair and this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I received this 2 weeks ago and have used it every other day since.  It&#x27;s a great product, makes my hair shine, relieves scalp itch.  I have had two people asking what have I done to my hair and are shocked when I tell them about the oil.  I&#x27;m sure they will buy some.  I feared that it would leave my hair &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but it does not!  It just seem to make my hair feel better and shinier.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried HSI Professional argon oil and I think between these two, I would choose Argan Oil by Arvazallia.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the HSI Professional, it&#x27;s definitely lighter and gives your hair that &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; feel rather than heavy and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair (not too thin but not too thick) and my hair is pretty healthy (except split ends). However, I do live in Las Vegas so it&#x27;s really dry here. So I need something to keep my hair frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely feel the difference when I do not use this product and when I do.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product about 3 weeks ago and started using it and I could immediately tell the difference of the quality of the oil (I was using HSI Professional Argan Oil before I made the switch) and then after using it for about a week, I went to a salon to get my hair done (color transformation &amp; cut) and as you ladies know, at hair salons they use quality products in your hair, but after I walked out of the salon, I definitely missed this argan oil. My hair was not as soft and smooth compared to when I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion is: if you are looking for something light and works well, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have dry color damaged hair and having only been using the product for a month but its keep my frizz at ease and smoothed out my curls. Here&#x27;s hoping it only gets better.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. My hair is smooth and soft and takes way less time to dry. I love this hair product!</li>
    <li> THis is has a nice smell to it. its package nice and its in a glass bottle so it can easily slip from hands after you gloss your hair. It smells nice sort of like a perfume. It has made hair soft and cant really give full disclosure because i just started using this last night</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, I love the way it feels on my hair. Silk like butter. Its light and a little goes a long way. This product is a must have. Also rub o alittle on my skin....it drives my mate crazy. Love it.......</li>
    <li> Fabulous product!!  I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Actually gives my hair more body, and absorbs completely into the hair without leaving an oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, and use more than suggested and still no oily feel.  I believe this will be a fantastic aid in restoring health to my somewhat dry hair.</li>
    <li> absolutely  love love this product.  My hair is  definitely more manageable and softer. Will definitely this product  again.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so I don&#x27;t see any change in my hair yet. But will continue to us and let you know more later. It does smell really nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was cheaper than another brand that I was using.  This product works just as well as some of the leading brands, and smells amazing.  I would highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My hair feels and looks amazing! I am very excited about this product and planning sharing with all of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple of times and like the way it makes my hair feel but the scent is a little cloying to me.  I would prefer it unscented if that is possible.</li>
    <li> this is amazing stuff! i have purchased 3 bottles of it now  and wont go back to anything else.  I have very fine long hair and was afraid it would weigh it down, but the opposite actually happened. I had fuller, softer, hair!  It took a few trys to guess the right amount for my hair type. You dont want to overdo it.  A little goes a long way and it will last a long time.  I even use it on my hair when its dry and brush it out or lightly blow dry. And it smells great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating to my scalp! : )  Easy to use and no oily after feel. I really love it! A+++</li>
    <li> I work outside and this product helps keep my hair soft and manageable with added shine!</li>
    <li> I really like the product and have been using it for almost a year and now I bought it for my family . It give my hair a natural look without having an oily shine and it helps enhancing my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells a lot like Revlon&#x27;s Fire and Ice perfume, only richer and more luxurious. The bottle is huge and a few squirts is enough for medium-longish hair, so the bottle will last you a long time. My hair is so soft and shiny, I only wish I had found this stuff sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle as a birthday gift for my mother, along with a couple of other hair-based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is very pretty. The glassy look, curved ends and honey golden color of the oil can pass for an expensive perfume, in fact. And the smell is soft and not at all overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at how much oil this brought; I actually expected a smaller bottle. And for the price I paid, both my mother and I were very pleased with the sheen and smoothness it gave her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need to use a very, very small amount. The smaller, the better I say since it is oil based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate the email reminders by the seller in asking if the product was okay. I&#x27;m sure they send the emails to every buyer, but it felt considerate.</li>
    <li> My man ask me what have you put in your hair, it look so soft and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feel on the side of my face when my hair touch. Just wish the bottle was&lt;br /&gt;bigger....I have very long hair... I need more product ASAP!!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!! My hair is so silky and soft after using the conditioner. I love the way it smells. Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle now and have been so happy with it. It&#x27;s almost July and my hair has survived up to 98% humidity with no frizz. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to wrap it in a pony tail because my hair gets so frizzy in humidity. Without this product I would have chopped off my hair like I normally do in the summer but not this summer.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Smells amazing and leaves hair shiny without weighing it down. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use this before styling my hair and ive noticed how much healthier and softer my hair is, i love this product :)</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, wet hair, dry hair, it works great!</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair, so this product really helps smooth out my hair without weighing it down.  It is also great in taming the fly-aways especially in the winter when there is a lot of static electricity.  I will be getting this product again.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy transaction! I feel it is a good product makes my scalp feels less dry and my hair is smoother and I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only this this a few times and I can already tell the difference that it has made</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good argan oil conditioner.  My regular brand was no longer available.  Glad I found this.  It smells great and does not make hair oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every anti-frizz product on the market and Argan Oil by Arvazilla is by far the best.  The oil is incredibly light with a subtle, pleasant scent.  It does not &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; my hair down like most anti-frizz products, and it leaves my hair natural looking with the frizz under control all day long.  I have fine, curly, long hair and Arvazilla Argan Oil works wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> My hair always gets tangled up after washing, so I use Argan Oil to help me comb my hair without pain. This product work well so far.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Makes hair soft and silky instead of greasy like other products.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! You only need a little bit &amp; your good to go . It leave my hair  so soft  shny &amp; more this product is worth every penny .</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and smooth, with ease of use and application.</li>
    <li> Shortly after I bought this product, I got an email from the seller making sure I had received the package and offering tips for use. I was highly impressed by this! The smell of this oil is heady. I can&#x27;t describe it, but I LOVE the smell. I think the product itself works pretty well, but as this is my first experience with argan oil I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I have very thick hair. I find it works best when I let it air dry and then while it is still just slightly wet, placing 5 drops through it. I still have to use the flat iron, but drying seems to be faster. I&#x27;ll also use a tiny bit for flyaways. I would consider buying again, but this one bottle will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This oil was a great addition to my hair regimen. I have thick course natural hair that I blow out twice a month. This product leaves my hair moisturized but not weighed down.</li>
    <li> Perfecct product if u want ti help ur hair get healthy, smell nice and help with dry damaged hair, recommended</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is amazing it makes my hair so soft and less frizzy. Which is great because I have naturally curly hair and I live is a highly humid area.</li>
    <li> good product. it smells good. I have not yet seen any dramatic change in hair growth but I hope it will help slow down the hair loss .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I originally purchased it to add shine to my dull hair and it did not disappoint. Not only does it add shine, it eliminates frizz and makes my hair managable. Surprisingly, it has a pleasant smell and does not weigh my hair down. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a try.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful and luxurious product. It makes my hair feel soft and silky and the smell is very pleasant. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and do hope it will work  for my hair.</li>
    <li> I noticed the most difference when I first started using it a couple months ago but it is a miracle product!!! It made/makes my hair so healthy, soft and strong. I recommend it to only close people because it&#x27;s so wonderful I almost want it to stay a secret. I use it every time I shower. I have fine hair that is somewhat thin and gets greasy so fast but this product doesn&#x27;t make it greasy at all. Truly love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months now and it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out so I&#x27;ve been pushing the length of time between hair cuts and my stylist said my hair is super healthy! This product keeps my hair shiny and soft and it smells great! I would highly recommend this product! In fact I just bought a bottle for my mom!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff ! I put my hair through a ton of torture last weekend &amp; about killed it, lol. This, along with the mask from the same brand, made it soft &amp; shiny again :) I&#x27;ll absolutely buy both products again &amp; again !</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase the ArganEsque Argan Oil, and I love it. Its leave my hair feeling silky, smooth, and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Also smells great. I usually apply the stuff after my hair dries.</li>
    <li> Glass bottle + oil...no good. The bottle slipped from my hands after the third use, I had glassy oil all over my counters. Shame, because I really liked the product. Too expensive for only three uses. :(</li>
    <li> My hair went from straw to silk!</li>
    <li> Love this. I have extremely dry, tight curls. I mix this with my conditioner and leave it in. There is no residue or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Thia is great oil! I have used all kinds of argon and Moroccan oils and this one beats all. It smells lovely, adds a nice shine to my colored and keratined hair. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil, it&#x27;s the only one that I&#x27;ve found that I like and use all the time. It keeps my hair feeling soft, light, and manageable, without every feeling oily or greasy. This product is definetly a must!</li>
    <li> Great product and even greater customer service.  Other companies should take lessons from this company on customer service.  The oil reduces the frizz in my dry coarse curly hair.  Leaves it soft and silky, not oily.  My hair is much more manageable.  I noticed that it works better on my dry hair then wet hair.  But you should try it both ways and see which works better for your hair since everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My hair looks and feels so silky soft. I definitely recommend this oil treatment for anyone wanting a smoother and shinier feel for their hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic customer service.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hair feels like silk:)</li>
    <li> My hair gets frizzy and I am always looking for a good product to calm it down,  I purchased other brands, some were alright, some were stinky. I was still on the hunt for something great so I tried ArganEsque Argan oil. I found great!  I massage 4 squirts in my wet hair, air dry a little and blow dry some more.  I finish with another squirt for shine. I leave the house sleek and chic, no frizzies!  And they stay away. The scent is nice, mild and not overpowering. I recommend ArganEsque Argan Oil. It&#x27;s a great product at a good price,</li>
    <li> I had used another argan oil product on my hair in the past so I knew that it provided results that I wanted.  I tried the Arvazallia &amp; found it less expensive and just as good if not better than the one I had used before.  I have color treated hair and it can tend to dry out on the ends. This oil adds moisture and sheen without unnecessary heaviness or greasiness.  I&#x27;ve even received compliments because I think it tends to enhance my highlights and enrich my color. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been reviewing many hair products lately and really taking an interest in a good product that works well for my type of hair as over the counter products just seemed like a waste of money. Lucky for me that I never gave up and found this oil. It is and does what it says. I love a good fine and this is just that. The customer service and company should be recognized for being 5 stars as well. Glad I took the chance. Hair is looking better then ever</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes based on other reviews. I have course wavy hair, not really curly, but thick course biracial hair. I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a product that can tame my hair so that I don&#x27;t have to flat iron it into submission. I used this for the first time after swimming. After washing my hair I worked two pumps of this oil into my hair, not sure what to expect, I let it air dry outside in humid conditions. Wow!!! My hair had no frizz and appeared sectioned into beautiful waves. Did I mention the humidity? This is a first for me. There is no oily finish, my hair just appears naturally smooth with thick waves. Usually I find a product will smooth my hair at the expense of a heavy oily finish. Many thanks, I have finally found my holy grail hair product after over 15 years of searching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day since I arrived. I feel like I have a priceless piece of liquid gold. Works very well, leaves my hair shiny and much less frizzier. I&#x27;m able to let my hair air-dry more with this product. Enhances my natural curls without making my hair look bizarre and unflattering. I appreciate you, Argan.</li>
    <li> Great product love it the best I have tried so far. It smooths my hair and gives shine . My hair looks healthy</li>
    <li> This oil treatment leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have tried many serum that claim to repair your hair. This product has actually improved my color treated hair. I will buy this again when I run out. It does not leave your greasy. It is weightless on fine hair</li>
    <li> Not a magical product that makes my hair feel completely different, but I think it does the job :)&lt;br /&gt;Bought this product few months ago and I am still using it.&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than the Macadamia Hair Treatment line as I found it to be too heavy for my hair &amp; better than It&#x27;s A 10.</li>
    <li> Very nice every day oil that keeps hair soft and well conditioned.  Not greasy and has the best smell ever.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. I don&#x27;t care too much for the smell and can be a little overwhelming. If you&#x27;re super sensitive to strong scents you may want to reconsider but if you can get passed it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Your Feedback&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Excellent packaging and equally excellent product. An &amp;#34;X factor&amp;#34; for an improved appearance.</li>
    <li> The scent is divine-works really well</li>
    <li> Made my hair stronger, shinier, frizz and tangle free. Love it!</li>
    <li> This oil smelled great and seemed to last forever. Did not order because it was a bit on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thin hair that likes to become static infused in dry weather, and doesn&#x27;t like to lay flat during humid weather. Just 304 squirts of this in your hand, rub it in your hands, and disburse through wet hair (yes, even my roots), and it helps control both problems and leaves hair much smoother and softer, than had I just blow-dried it with no treatment.</li>
    <li> Product is fine , however the spray mechanism broke leading to waste of the product</li>
    <li> Absolutely luv this product and will buy it again once I run out!!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love the way this made my dry damaged hair feel.  I have never had such soft silky hair.  I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
    <li> The Argan oil works beautifully with my hair expecially on hot and humid days. I just use two  or three drops of the oil when my hair looks dry and lifeless and the oil just puts immediate shine into my hair and revitalizes it.</li>
    <li> I have curly wavy hair that gets curlier and frizzy during humid summers. This product controls the frizz and gives me soft, manageable curls. Since I have started using it, I also do not need to wash my hair as frequently. Instead of washing it every day or two, I can go up to three days between washes. My hair stays clean, shiny and fresh without excessive oil. I have shoulder&#x3D;length hair and use three pumps of the hair oil on freshly washed (not yet dry hair and then one pump each morning to control overnight frizzing until I wash again. Love it!</li>
    <li> Be careful not to use too much, otherwise, it&#x27;s great on hair.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life because it removed all the stress of maintaining my hair. I was ready to cut the hair short and start over and that was prevented by Argan oil.The unintended dread locks are gone and the long high volume fine hair is back!.I wish I had been aware of these products years ago.I am aware now and will continue to purchase and utilize them in the future..</li>
    <li> It had a minor effect on my hair. I don&#x27;t honestly notice any significant change.</li>
    <li> My only reason for 4 stars is that this product is full of silicones, so it&#x27;s not actually helping to make your hair stronger/healthier, it just feels that way. But it certainly does help manageability and shine. You just have to figure out a good about to use for your specific hair.</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp get very dry in the winter, and was looking for a product to help alleviate some of that.  My hairdresser suggested Moroccan oil, and I decided to give Argan a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this oil, and for the price and quality, I would definitely recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because the odor is very pleasant, but just a little strong for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a definite buy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Erased years of damage to my hair and now it&#x27;s silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, colored hair.  This helps control the frizz, give my hair a nice shine, help weigh down the curls all without feeling greasy.  If I could change 1 thing about this product it would be the container.  I find it hard to grasp when my hands are wet with the argon oil and more than once it has slipped out of my hands and on the floor.  If it falls on my tile instead of the area rug it will break.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Truly enhanced the look, feel and overall health of my hair, all without leaving my hair limp.</li>
    <li> After YEARS of frizzy unmanageable hair, this is the first and only product that tamed my hair and made it soft and silky.  I constantly get compliments about my hair now, and I tell all my friends to try this out.  LOVE!!</li>
    <li> It does make a difference. After few uses I already see the difference in my hair. It&#x27;s much softer and easier to manage. However, I was looking for something that would fix my dry scalp and this oil isn&#x27;t as effective for that purpose, or maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough.</li>
    <li> it really works! my hair is so smooth an bright. but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent, but it&#x27;s ok...</li>
    <li> This is the perfect hair oil product. Some oils leave your hair greasy (in fact, most do), but this one is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or attract more oil. It also smells amazing! Bonus was when the seller reached out to me with more tips on how to use.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous hair products over the years trying to find one that got rid of frizzy, dry hair without looking oily. This product is by far the best. I can honestly say this is the only one I will use from now on. I love the softness and shine and I love that I can use it on wet or dry hair. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this product...you will love it! I have recommended it to so many people and everyone ends up loving it. I&#x27;m soooo happy that I found this!!</li>
    <li> Great hair oil, makes my hair very soft without making it too oily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I now consider myself an Arvazallia girl!  The packaging is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love it I use this on my hair every morning.</li>
    <li> I love it 👌 After the shower i tried with the first time my hair felt so amazing... I felt like those girls on the commercials with there hair so amazing I wouldn&#x27;t write a review if I didn&#x27;t like it I so love it 😍💁</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It smells great and I noticed a difference with one day of use.  I used the Hydrating mask first (I had to buy the hydrating mask separately) then I used the oil after (I put it on while my hair was wet and I let it dry that way).  My hair is naturally curly and very thin and my curls looked really nice after I used it.</li>
    <li> It worked wonders on my dry hairs..simply loved this product</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 other brands of hair oils  and have never been this satisfied.  I use this everyday in my damp hair and when it dry&#x27;s as well.  I have stringy and fine hair. This product keeps my hair tangle free, smooth, shiny, and healthy looking not stringy!  I also use the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair mask once a week which helps alot!  Great products even after long time use my hair still takes to the products.  I highly recommend these products!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in good condition.  Love this for not only my hair but skin as well.</li>
    <li> My product was ship in large box which cause my fee extremely high y shipment was poor.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product recently without checking the country of origin. I just found out its made in China. It&#x27;s not even a good product but no way am I using this now. Why didn&#x27;t the sellers advertise this fact?? I would advise people to,think twice before buying this.</li>
    <li> Pretty dispenser, but this product did not work for me... I took a gamble, because I could not find the ingredients when ordering this product...I thought this product was argan oil, but it is silicone based and my hair was a little stiff from use...when is says argan oil Hair Treatment, be aware that it is mixed with other ingredients... My hair is coarse like/kinky/curly and so I go to the Dominican hair salon&#x27;s in Queens, NY for a blow dry to get a sleek and flowy look...My salon did an excellent job with my hair, but once adding the product upon wrapping my hair at night, I noticed when I combed it out in the morning my hair looked and appeared a little/slightly stiff....it might be little, but to me that&#x27;s a BIG DEAL...no beueno!!! From now on I am sticking to pure argan oil which I have started using instead...not too keen on the smell of pure argan oil, but I can get past the smell if it means healthier and flowy looking hair.... I dumped the product and refilled the bottle with my smelly argan oil...it dispenses just the right amount of oil for my hair...wasted my money, but the bottle works great!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Arvazallia&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful to some of the viewers</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product, has renewed my fine lifeless hair and also a very pleasing aroma.</li>
    <li> I got this item for a month ago. It works amazingly. My hair is soft and shinny, plus it&#x27;s very inexpensive. I am glade I made my purchase. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived on time and as described thank you very much</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It has a great smell and mades my hair soft and shinny! I love it. MUST HAVE ITEM &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have to first mention the custom service. It is absolutely the best! I review this product and mentioned the pump breaking and they contacted me the same day. This Vendor has provided me with the BEST customer service I have received. And I shop a lot, and do mean a lot, and not just as online purchase but a purchase all together.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to thank the vendor for the amazing, amazing service provided..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing the product, it&#x27;s is ahhhhhmazing! I use 3-4 drops on towel dried hair. I also at night put it on my ends, and use it before I straighten or curl my hair for heat protection. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t make my hairy stringy, oily or wet looking. The shine it adds is beautiful and I constantly get compliments on it. I will stay a customer forever!!</li>
    <li> As they promised - my hair has been soft and smells so good too!!</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair very soft and has a really nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair.  It&#x27;s done nothing terrible or awesome to my hair.  I&#x27;d like to believe it&#x27;s doing something to my dry scalp so I continue to buy it.  It&#x27;s not bad enough to return it...just nothing special (to me).</li>
    <li> The product works very well for damaged hair. I have fine hair that was damaged from a drug reaction. Just one pump in the palm of my hands, then rubbed into the hair, tames the damaged hair and gives it a nice natural shine.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the product I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled. Even though it was packaged properly, when I opened the wrapping it felt slick.  I wondered if the bottle had cracked but to my delight it hadn&#x27;t. I washed the sticky stuff off and let it dry.  The next day I used the product and voilà, perfection in the bottle. Though I do prefer the long lasting and comforting scent of Moroccan Oil this product matches and might even defeat how it hydrates and fixes your hair. Although the gross stuff that I will never be identified did gross me out this product is defiantly a 9. They just need to work on having a stronger, longer lasting scent.</li>
    <li> I love this for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave it super oily or wet looking, but does seem to help hide split and dead ends. My hair looks beautiful, healthy and shiny now.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Morrocan oil light and though I would try this but feel a little disappointed as no matter how little I use it still seems to make my hair look greasy so I have now reverted to my original product...</li>
    <li> This oil works wonders! I have over processed hair, which is coarse and frizzy, and this oilf makes my hair shiny and soft. Just a drop will do you. would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very well package and on time delivery no complaint about that and the product is real.  My hair looking better than ever before and I try different brand names with no result I recommended it!!</li>
    <li> I love it and the smell is delicious. It leaves my hair very soft. I really recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> This product does makes your very hair soft.  Basically odorless. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! light weight doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down leaving it nice and soft I use it on damp clean hair and after styling give me extra shine and it smell great. You could also apply like directed on the box.. but this is how I use it I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product by recommendation.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I love it.  Everyday I find more ways to use it.  My hair is thick, course and dry.  I mix this into my wet hair and style as usual and my hair is amazing.  The bottle is glass and feels and looks like an even more expensive product.  The sellers sent it to me quickly and wrapped it very well.  I also purchased the deep conditioning hair mask and it&#x27;s just as amazing.  I&#x27;ve used a very expensive mask for years and this is just as good for half the $$$$.  I will be buying more of both in the future.</li>
    <li> This is very good product and,  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The oil gives my hair a slightly better shine and softness. It is easy to apply, leaves my hair  frizzie free and does not feel greasy or oily. Excellent treatment for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This product has particularly been great this summer.  My hair has a tendency to want to curl in the heat but this helps it stay straight and smooth.  It&#x27;s a must have if you have any frizziness</li>
    <li> My hair loves this oil.  It is not heavy and just enough to keep my hair healthy and happy!</li>
    <li> Oh Arvazallia!  Where have you been all of my life?  This product is MAGIC!!!  The compliments I&#x27;ve gotten about my hair, the looks I&#x27;ve gotten, the questions about it all, it&#x27;s all so much more than I ever expected.  Please, don&#x27;t ever stop making this product.  I&#x27;d pay any amount for this, it&#x27;s that good!  5 Big, Bright, Shiny Stars On This!  Kathleen Gilbert</li>
    <li> I had very long hair that was very thick but coloring it destroyed my hair. I was highlighting it blond. My hair was just breaking off. Now my hair is so damaged. This is an amazing product. It make my hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> Very good product relative to the price. My hair looks healthy and shiny when I use it.</li>
    <li> Had tangled unmanageable broken hair .. feels and looks healthier</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I highly recommend it! I was hesitant at first because of the price, but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This oil smells really nice and does provide good shine. I have frizzy 3C/4A African American hair. I find this product works better and provide a shinier look when applied to freshly washed hair than when dry. One pump per small section was plenty. The scent stays on your hair for quite a while too. There is no greasy feeling - very smooth and soft. Definitely would not purchase from a salon but for the Amazon price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> I am using this on the two different hair types: Asian/ European wavy and Asian/ African-American coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is actually working since we have gotten done our hair professionally first.&lt;br /&gt;At least, it is not interfering the pro result.</li>
    <li> It does control the hair and it smells nice. I will give it an excellent rating after I have used it more.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Sep 10 and it came today really fast shipping. Love the Argan Oil. Makes my hair smooth and frizz free. Only thing is when i first got it i went to pull the cap off and the whole thing came open and pour all over clothes. Still the this Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Very good product for relaxed hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and smells great. My hair feels and looks healthier</li>
    <li> So far so good!  This leaves my hair very sily, and keeps it from becoming dry.  My hair is very thick and tends to be dry and breaks.  I&#x27;ve ben using this for a couple of weeks now, and notices less shedding, and shine.  I&#x27;m thinking about taking this to the salon with me for my next appointment to see how my stylist likes it.  I&#x27;ll provide another update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and was afraid to use it after washing as I thought it might make my hair too limp and oily. So I applied it to my dry hair and left it on for a few minutes before washing and I was amazed at how nice it made my hair. Without styling or blow drying my hair had more body and bounce than ever and wasn&#x27;t at all oily. I think I&#x27;m going to like this :).</li>
    <li> Work great and smells nice. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with the results. I use this as well as the deep conditioner so I don&#x27;t know how it would be alone, but together, the results are amazing. It makes my hair so soft and smooth that I no longer have to flat iron it. I love it.</li>
    <li> I personally loves this oil, the scent of it but others say it&#x27;s  overpowering. (Only 1 person)  it works really well on dry  hair and  usually keeps my hair soft for about 2-3 days before washing with a soap bar shampoo.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the effect on my hair but so far so good. I apply it after I take a shower, when my hair is a Lil bit wet. Smell is not that bad too... I will update my review once I&#x27;ve tried the hot oil method.....</li>
    <li> Smells great and a little goes a LOOOONG way.  Start with just a bit through damp hair and towel dry or style.</li>
    <li> light weight smell good hair treatment oil. This first week that I have used this treatment, leave my hair moisturized and conditioned.it mends split ends to. I&#x27;m wondering how much my hair will grow by next month</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product fully before posting a review.  I have fine hair with highlights that got over processed by an inexperienced stylist.  Even after getting a cut my ends still looked like poof balls and I had been wearing it up or in a ponytail everyday.  I have been trying everything I could get my hands on to rehydrate without success.  When I read the reviews on this they really sounded too good to be true.  The day I received this I had already washed my hair, but still put a few drops through my dry hair and could see a slight difference in the shine.  The smell was good but not as intense as I thought it would be.  The next day I washed my hair and used an increased amount on my towel dried hair from scalp to ends.  I let it air dry and then put some more product through my hair before daring to take an ion straightening iron through it. WOW!  I could not believe the difference.  Not only was my hair shiny it looked healthy too.  I am so happy I ordered this!  I continue using at night and in the morning taking a drop and warming it in my hands and running them through my ends.  I can actually wear my hair down again.  Not sure how it would be for other hair types, but it definitely works for mine! Highly, highly recommend this and using in the prescribed way for the best results.</li>
    <li> Feels great in my hair, not heavy or greasy, just shiny great smelling hair.  Really nice.</li>
    <li> it has helped my hair so much not as dry and getting better every time I use it I&#x27;ll buy more!!!</li>
    <li> It does not weigh my hair down which is a plus! I use it on wet hair before styling and on dry hair to condition my hair. I have no complaints but I cannot tell if my hair benefits from it. I assume it is good for my hair so I will continue to use. I bought also for my daughter and I will see if she likes it.  My hairdresser did say it is good to put in to get a better deposit of color.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent hair products.  This is the best treatment for your hair and not as expensive as brazillian blowouts.  Would recommend to everyone who wants silky hair..</li>
    <li> Love it, I have seen a difference already and my hair feels silky afterwards.  Been getting lots of complaints since using it.</li>
    <li> Great oil...it is  lightweight oil, which is nice for my long thick hair. It has  a pretty scent too. I use it often as a detangler before blow drying. I like that it isn&#x27;t as greasy feeling on my hair as other oils have been.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and was reluctant to apply any type of oil to my hair. I use two pumps of the oil and work it through my hair before styling with a blow dryer. I love how shiny and smooth my hair looks. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> i am a african american  sixty three years old.over the years my hair has become very hard  and crusty. i have tried every conditioner  that i could get my hands on.none of them worked . this oi[ has restored the softness  and lustre of yester years.i woud recommend this oil to all of my family  and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair!</li>
    <li> My hair was shedding very badly! Went to my dermatologist and a biopsy was taken from my scalp. Diagnosis was stress not alopecia related! I&#x27;ve been using this oil since the day it arrived and I&#x27;ve had 100000000% percent results! :D I&#x27;ve been using this oil along with what my dermatologist prescribed, and haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions. No more tangles, hair is stronger, it actually shines now, and a major change in the shedding I WAS going through. When I return for follow up with my dermatologist&amp;#62;I&#x27;m going to recommend this product to him for use in his practice. I will add, if you&#x27;re actually going bald (alopecia); I don&#x27;t think this oil will help restart hair roots! I suggest you see a dermatologist first to determine why you&#x27;re shedding, so there is no disappointment or loss of funds trying to condition hair that isn&#x27;t going to be there no matter what you do.This is a great product and deserves the right reaction and knowledge for it to continue to be as great as it is!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped and it is *really* heavily perfumed.  It also isn&#x27;t pure argan oil and I don&#x27;t like all the additives.  I tried the Vizeri organic pure argan oil and I am MUCH happier with that product.</li>
    <li> Smells like expired oil.... I expected more.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this product from the very first time I used it I had results, good results my hair is shinny and soft and manageable I will keep using this product and keep telling everyone how great it is</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair feel really soft &amp; helps with my frizz issues. I use on my wet hair &amp; when it dries I have nice curls that I can fluff up. I was a little worried as the smell was a bit perfumy for my tastes but it does calm down after a bit and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I don&#x27;t use, I can see the difference as my hair does look duller and drier. My natural hair state is dry and frizzy. I can&#x27;t usually leave my hair down and air dry as it looks like a bit of a mess. What a difference when I use the argan oil treatment. I can actually let it air dry and it doesn&#x27;t look like I didn&#x27;t comb my hair ha ha!</li>
    <li> I bought this Moroccan Argan oil after doing my research, and fell in love. We ran out and my husband picked up a $5 cheap &amp;#34;moroccan&amp;#34; oil from the drug store (he&#x27;s obsessed now, too)... and it was horrible. This is the only kind that has not made my hair greasy or weighed down. It smells fabulous and the shine is incredible. Since I&#x27;ve started using this oil, my hair has grown out fast and is healthier than ever. I hadn&#x27;t had a hair cut for 5 months and when I went in to have it trimmed, I was surprisingly informed there were barely enough split end to justify a cut. Super happy with this product! I use it daily for frizz and heat protection. If using before blow drying, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t soaking wet when you put it in.. otherwise it&#x27;ll take forever to dry and you may not like the results.</li>
    <li> Very excellent product.  I get exactly the day specified by the Seller. Thanks Amazon and Seller for sell high quality product.</li>
    <li> So far i have used this product twice since purchasing it. I have natural hair while i can say it has moisturized my hair i cannot say it has stopped the breakage thus far. I will continue using and see.  June 3, 2015 review So I have been using this product along with the mask and my shoulder length hair started to fall to the point where it is way above shoulders now. I now have to be repairing my hair for re-growth. I kept treating  my hair with the product thinking maybe my diet etc.was causing the breakage. Since I stopped using this product and went back to using Black Castor Oil the breaking has stopped so I realized the issue was these products. I have very thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves your hair silky smooth and shiny. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> It smells great! Leaves hair looking nice after applying and then blowing drying!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair treatment for me; my hair loss has sharply decreased. I would recommend this to anyone that needs to revitalize their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product an &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; because it worked for me unlike A LOT of other products I&#x27;ve used. I have wavy-curly hair that frizzes up when it&#x27;s humid, and it is humid ALL THE TIME where I live.&lt;br /&gt;This product- combined with others I&#x27;m using- has definitely made my hair softer and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have extremely damaged hair bleached me a grade 1 and this is the only treatment that has left my hair soft and silky and moisturized and with a twinkle to end &#x27;m 100 % satisfied. if I could give it 10 stars . Now &#x27;ll buy two before they sell out .</li>
    <li> Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning it because I used it everyday since I received it (four days) and my hair was still really dry and frizzy. I also noticed that it made my scalp itchy, possibly from an allergic reaction, which is another reason why I didn&#x27;t want to continue to use this product and send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the way it smelled and appreciate the money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased my third bottle, am officially &amp;#34;hooked,&amp;#34; I guess. It leaves my hair soft as a baby&#x27;s and is a champion frizz fighter. Economical: one bottle lasts me at least a year. Elegant glass bottle with silvery cap. Only complaint: the pump dispenses itsy bitsy amounts (for ME, anyhow), and I wind up screwing off the top and pouring the oil into my palm, which gets a bit messy. That&#x27;s only a small drawback given the product&#x27;s excellence.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product hence the reason I have given it 4stars. After I have used it a while I will return and update accordingly. So far I LOVEEE what I am experiencing. First the scent is so so so good, it smells like an oil you should be using on the skin. The texture is rich, non greasy and light. It goes into the scalp and hair easily and makes the hair feel smooth and manageable. For those sisters who have all natural hair. . .you CAN use this product. It is great. I do recommend it to anyone who want a great smelling easy to work with product. You do not even need to wash hands after using it because it is not oily and smells superb. I will be back after a few weeks when I can better speak on the long term effects.</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s amazing and it smells really good</li>
    <li> i usually hate the Morocco products in my life, because it has no pure ingredients in ,this product came with a high packaging  &amp; has a great healthy ingredients for the hair i used this oil yesterday and i left it for more than 5 hours,when i wash my hair i noticed a big deference ,my hair become softer and shiny also when its dried i applied a little amount of the same oil and i mixed it with the mask,then applied t to my ends,and i left it for 2 hours ,the result is the BOOMB .</li>
    <li> I am not fan of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a great product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It protects from heat, shines my hair, manageable, and keep it moist &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of split ends, but it makes my hair feel really healthy, soft, and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wavy frizzy long hair. If I don&#x27;t manage it, it&#x27;s like a birds nest.&lt;br /&gt;I usually straight my hair or curl with curling iron. (I said this product protects from heat, because my hair started to grow longer even I straighten or curled my hair often).&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t have to curl or straighten my hair when I use this. It makes my hair style like beach girl hair style look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it smells good for some people. Not for me, but I got use to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore... it smells like Eastern Europe, maybe it&#x27;s Moroccan fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I wash my hair and towel dried. I use 15 pumps, because my hair is very long. Very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this argan oil! My hair feels so good! It made my hair silky, and shiny. It is safe for color treated hair. I got so many compliments from my friends. I can&#x27;t think of any other product. This is my all time fav! Give it a try! Your hair will thank u!</li>
    <li> Its the perfect leave in conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;-not too grease&lt;br /&gt;-has a pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;-really moisturises the hair&lt;br /&gt;-very good to my hair so far</li>
    <li> Let me first day that this oil smells amazing. However, I have not seen any difference in my hair as far as less breakage. What I have noticed is that when I wash my hair with the matching shampoo and conditioner that I lose a lot of hair. This was not the case before I start using the shampoo conditioner and this hair treatment so at this point I believe that it&#x27;s these products that&#x27;s making my hair fall out. I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for about 6 weeks now and I just started using the hair treatment 2 weeks ago. I will give another update in about 4 weeks</li>
    <li> great for flat ironing my african american hair, i just hate the grandma perfume scent it has</li>
    <li> It smells great. It makes my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love my hair!!! It means I constantly look for products to experiment,  looking for &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;.  My hair is elbow length, wavy, highlighted and &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; if I don&#x27;t use anything. When I received this oil, I had my hair highlighted and had trouble brushing, because it was &amp;#34;over dried&amp;#34;.  With this oil, my hair was so easy to brush and my puffiness was gone.  Also I really liked the smell.  To me it was like a very pleasant perfume. I loved it.</li>
    <li> Did leave your hair greasy the next day if you put too much.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Amazing service!!</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair type, long, fine and curly.  In-between washes I will work in a small amount of oil and somehow it will refresh my curls and I&#x27;m ready for the day.  I would recommend this product and purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  For the first time, my hair has a sheen and has lost its brittleness.  Previously, I was using expensive products that my hairdresser recommended.  The effect of these only lasted a few days.  Argan oil smells wonderful, and you only need a small amount each time.  Am very pleased with it, also the packaging and speedy delivery of the shipment.</li>
    <li> Leaves your had soft without weighing it down, does not leave it feeling greasy like some other products and love the smell reminds me of baby powder.</li>
    <li> I love this product: It has stopped the shedding and breakage that I was experiencing. Use it daily to protect my hair  from the heat that I put in it everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister - she has a bit of damage from multiple colorings. SHE LOVES THIS PRODUCT!! She said it made her hair feel so much softer and smoother after just a few uses!</li>
    <li> amazing product! leaves my hair so soft and also smells like heaven! love love love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this oil treatment just once prior to color treating my fine, frizzy, dry hair. The color took better, and hair is softer, shinier, and smoother.  It looks and feels healthier and hydrated.  The oil didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down...  a little goes a long way!  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair and its bouncier curls!!  I&#x27;m sold and so would you!!</li>
    <li> I am a real customer used it for the first time last week and man it truly helped me. This is me black hair, I had over dryed it always trying to cover gray. It&#x27;s was dull, dry. Ends were horrible and heat damaged. My scalp was itching severely. It has bouced my hair fast. I will continue to us it. And I probably won&#x27;t have tried it had I not seen the many reviews. Thank you all before me. Cause it really helped me out. For the record I am not some person that got it for free or writing fake reviews.</li>
    <li> if it weren&#x27;t for the overwhelming fragrance, I&#x27;d have given this product 5 stars. I love what it does for my hair. I have bleached hair that gets tangled easily and ends up looking fried if I&#x27;m not careful. Since using this oil, I&#x27;ve stopped needing to use conditioner on my hair. I&#x27;ve also started using it as shave oil on my legs and it does an amazing job there too. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> ALL products by Arvazallia pass my approval.  They meet and exceed my expectations.  Follow instructions and you will not be disappointed.  This oil makes hair so silky it will hardly stay in a pony tail elastic!  so I use a clip:)  truly a good product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Why long term? It only takes a little  oil dab ,to gloss over  shoulder length hair  that has some fly away hairs .&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and does not make hair heavy , unless you use a tablespoon or more. Use a just a little  and then increase if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;No need to waste this great product.&lt;br /&gt;r.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE HAIR OIL USE IT ONCE A WEEK MAKES HAIR LOOK HEALTHY.</li>
    <li> Excellent immediate treatment for dry, flyaway hair! On days my hair won&#x27;t behave and I have no time to wash it, I apply some to my dry hair and cover with a cap when showering, and afterwards my hair looks and feels great for the day, as well as smelling beautifully. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE!!! Does what it is supposed to. Make my hair VERY soft and NOT greasy no matter how much I use (I don&#x27;t use alot either) used with an Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan oil but I am not a fan of the price tag.  I have very kinky, frizzy hair that is prone to being dry.  I put product in that often makes it feel a little stiff and drab. Every so often I would treat myself to a bottle of Moroccan Oil.  True Story....  I went to the broadway production of \\&quot;hair\\&quot; and one of the actors ran over to me and scrunched his face in my hair (this is part of the show.... they do interact spontaneously with the audience) and proclaimed \\&quot;your hair smells fantastic\\&quot;  That was with the Moroccan oil.  So recently I set about to order another bottle of the stuff when this Argan oil popped up under the \\&quot;people who viewed this item also viewed...........\\&quot;  So I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous.  I find this to be just as good as the Moroccan Oil.  It has a fabulous scent and it instantly rejuvenates my hair and makes it so soft and silky.  Believe me, my hair does not easily convert to soft and silky.  And the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Fabulous product.  At least as good as Moroccan oil.  I will purchase this again and again.  And, it seems to last longer than the Moroccan Oil as well.</li>
    <li> love this product so much already! I am seeing such a huge difference in my hair...it looks and feels so healthy! I received an email from the company with tips on how to use it most effectively and I appreciated that, but I don&#x27;t use nearly as much as they say. I used two pumps in damp hair and it was too much. This bottle will last forever!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Its not greasy and leaves my hair incredibly soft, shiny and manageable...and it smells so good!! Definitely recommend this product, even for us oily scalp people.</li>
    <li> Smells really wonderful and makes hair easier to untangle.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. The oil works well on my beach damaged hair. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for years and decided to give this a try.  I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> All I gotta say is that its worth buying! You wont regret it honestly.</li>
    <li> Its. A great product I have ever used</li>
    <li> This is the that product I exactly want. After treatment, my long hair become very smooth and easy to brush. The most good thing, I won&#x27;t feel my hands and hairs oily after applying. This is an highly recommended product for hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I just love this Argan Oil, I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones in the past, but this one really makes a difference. My hair is silky, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Used the product twice already!!! My hair looks shiny and smooth...I bought both products and I am really satisfied with the results I am getting with these products.. Cant wait to see more hair progress with these products</li>
    <li> Really good product.  Will last me quite a while.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bleach my black hair to platinum and couldn&#x27;t find a way for it to stay healthy and grow out. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and it has changed my stringy, dry ends to something that can be considered hair again. It has also been growing quicker than usual so be prepared if you bleach your hair because root touch ups have to be a little more frequent.</li>
    <li> Nice, But i found it to be too oily</li>
    <li> Worked for my fine hair.  I put two pumps on my towel-dried hair and let my hair dry (I do not use a blow dryer).  I noticed the scent faded quickly, so now I put one more pump on my totally dry hair and now the scent last longer.  The damaged ends of my hair still need cut off; however, this product makes them the split ends look and feel better.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dried out hair extensions. Did not help at all. Makes my normal thin, fine hair greasy after a few hours of wearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I randomly came across this product because after just a couple of uses it has become my holy grail. I have extremely long thick hair which comes with numerous split ends and this oil does wonders for my hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair. It&#x27;s pretty hard to manage. It frizzes, and dries out. My daughter also has curly hair. We love this stuff! This does not weigh our hair down, gives it a shine, and brings out the curl.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good too.. I will buy again.,&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. Best hair products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I have very dry hair due to excessive heat use (blowdryer, flat iron, and curler) and Arvazallia products have definitely improved my hair texture in two applications.</li>
    <li> product is okay, soothes hair but isnt long lasting</li>
    <li> I pair this with the hair mask! Smells great and works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and it seems to be really good stuff.  Makes my hair really shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;Smells so very good.&lt;br /&gt;Feels as if my hair is more healthy and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I have been using argon oil for three years - this is the best so for.  I have straight but thin hair.  This product makes my hair very shiny and silky. I use flat iron daily causing damage my hair - hopefully it helps for protect my hair as well :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging and wonderful product at great price.  I will never buy Moroccan Oil again!  Avazalia Oil is my new go to product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely 100% satisfied with this product!&lt;br /&gt;My curly hair shine and look much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am going to buy it for my mom and mother-in-low :)</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes hair soft, price is great for the product</li>
    <li> I love this. Makes my hair look really great. It works really great. I would recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> Love this. The seller explained to me how to use it after I received it and it works great. My hair is so shiny and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Wow...is all I can say.  This is an amazing product.  I use it when I let my hair air dry and I also use it when I blow dry my hair.  My hair is silky soft all day.</li>
    <li> Just fantastic for my hair.  Will be a regular buy for me</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does not make my hair greasy. The fact that it gets absorbed so thoroughly by my scalp &amp; hair shafts is great. This was the third product I had tired as the other brands made my hair greasy and ugh! I have very fine very thin hair and things that go on heavy make it worse. Plus it really does help to de-tangle. I could not believe how the brush went thru my hair after I very roughly towel dried it. I was very tired that night and had no patients for going slow. It&#x27;s to soon to tell what the good is but my hair fluffed out thicker by the second app. Not because there is more of it, obviously, but because the hair shafts are truly absorbing the Argan oil and are fatter for it. Even if I don&#x27;t see any better result long term than that, I am still thrilled with this stuff. Will try to remember in the future to post further progress and impressions.</li>
    <li> This oil has helped my porous, curly hair (with gray) to SHINE!  It is softer and much more manageable since I started using this treatment.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I was desperate to find an affordable product that would help my long, fine, and flyaway hair to settle down! I recently moved from a humid climate in the southeast to the southwest desert and my hair now snaps, crackles, and pops sending sparks zipping through the air. When you were a kid, did you ever rub a balloon on your hair to produce static electricity, which then caused your hair to stand up?  Well, that is my hair in the desert sans balloon.  Not pretty!  My hair attaches itself to my clothing and floats in the air up around my ears!  I&#x27;ve moisturized and conditioned.  I&#x27;ve applied other products but either of two things happened, after an hour or so my hair would be dancing around my ears again or it was limp and oily looking!  I want silky, soft, shiny, calm, and in its place hair; not oily-limp.  This Argan Oil does the trick on my hair. It is now smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the oil while my hair is still damp after shampooing and conditioning.  I smooth the oil on the ends of my hair from ear level to the tips.  I particularly pay attention to the very ends making sure to apply enough oil to not just tame but treat them.  I don&#x27;t apply the oil all the way to the scalp on a daily basis.  I do however use this oil once per week on my scalp.  I apply it directly to my scalp, this takes several squirts.  I rub it in well and leave it on while I do things about the house.  Later, I shampoo and condition and then reapply the oil as described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also apply this oil on my skin.  Since moving to the desert, I&#x27;m about to dry up and blow away with the tumbleweeds!  One morning, after doing my hair I was enjoying the feeling of the oil on the palms of my hands.  So, I pumped a bit more and smoothed it on the back of my hands. Ooh!  I pumped a bit more and smoothed the oil over my forehead.  Ahh!  From then on, I went crazy and dobbed it around my eyes, cheeks, and throat, avoiding the T-zone area.  I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m old enough to be past breakouts to my skin so using it thus is not a problem for me.  I also don&#x27;t apply it to my skin on a daily basis as I have facial moisturizers with sunscreen that I love and use.  However, this argan oil feels marvelous on my skin! It&#x27;s great on my nails and cuticles.  And you know what else? I&#x27;ve used it on my feet! At first, I just rubbed some in and then I had the brilliant idea, well, I thought it was brilliant, of putting a few pumps in a pan of water, and soaking my feet in it! Ding, ding, winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil smells fabulous!  The fragrance is warm and soft.  It isn&#x27;t an overpowering, make your eyes water, and your nose sneeze kind of scent.  It&#x27;s soft and wafting.  Which is a darned good thing since I now am covered in it...head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might laugh but you know where else I use this amazing oil?  On my dog&#x27;s fly-away hair! Yes, I do!  Boone is a Shih-Tzu and the hair on his long tail and ears is also acting up and flying around in this desert clime, hey, he can&#x27;t be walking around looking like that!  I&#x27;m a good dog-mother and will not let my little guy be embarrassed in the neighborhood!  This great product works on his hair too!  And he looks, hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you have a similar need to mine...and Boone&#x27;s!past breakouts to my skin so using it thus is not a problem for me.

    <li> My wife uses it and so far she&#x27;s happy with the results; she said she will stick to it for a while as she thinks she found what she was looking for</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exetrmely nice and wonderful aroma and rather good volume.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Product!&lt;br /&gt;Congradulations!</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil for Hair Treatment was for my mom and she loves it, so I guess it&#x27;s all that matters</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair and my 4 year old daughter has curly hair.  It&#x27;s amazing in our hair and my daughter feel in love with the smell immediately.  I enjoy it too.  Not too oily or greasy.  I used about 7 pumps, work it through my hair and then a few more pumps.  It makes my hair so soft.  A great conditioner to compliment your hair is Alba Botanical Coconut Conditioner.  WOW!  It will be hard to stop running your fingers through your hair.  Leaves your hair buttery velvety smooth with out the greasy look.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is light; not greasy. I have been using this treatment for the past few weeks; like how it feels on my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> I love the hair more even more if that&#x27;s possible! It literally glides ever so lightly on the hair without a greasy build up. My husband LOVES the smell and can&#x27;t keep his nose out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Have used and continue to use.  Love the Argan Oil treatment.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awsome! i love their hair mask but i love this even more. with this i  no longer have to straighte my hair just to take care of some frizz in the front...just two three pumps, i apply it where i need it more and brush it down, its simple the best hair product i&#x27;ve tried...oh and leaves hair with a beautiful shine, the bit bonus is that it smell heavenly! Its also doen&#x27;t do too much damage to my bank account, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this product leaves hair shiny and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Average results.</li>
    <li> I loved it. The smell is very good but the best thing is that I can use it and my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy or dirty. I have thin hair and this product worked very good for me.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Makes hair a little shiny after applying it.</li>
    <li> thought it would work better.... no soft hair but kind of greas.I have tred better italian products for hair.</li>
    <li> It smells beautiful, tames the frizz and calms down my itchy scalp. I also use it as a body lotion because I love the smell so much.</li>
    <li> I used this oil treatment along with the deep conditioning. Although not the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used, it did help a lot with the hair damage my hair faced when I had it colored ombre. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but my fiance has already noticed the shine coming back to my hair. My hair is starting to feel softer as well (it felt like a rug after getting it ombre colored). So far it does what it says it would. Only star though because the packaging really sucks. the pump already slipped off the glass bottle after the first use...leaking oil everywhere. I was able to get it back into place, but definitely would never try traveling with this bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product, do not greasy my hair and give silk results.</li>
    <li> AMAZING my hair is healthier and thicker. I will be back for more  I just bought second bottle, this product is just outstanding.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> BEST product I have used so far! My hair is extremely coarse with kinky, tight curls. I straighen it once a week and let it stay straight until I wash it again about 7 days later.  I dont use any other products on my hair to avoid build up.  I use this serum in the morning when I wake up and it makes my hair shiny (but not greasy) and tames any frizz I may have. An added bonus... it smells amazing!  I would recommend to anyone.  And if you are nervous about the price, dont be... it is worth it.  The bottle is large and will last long! I cant say enough how happy I am I found this!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves my hair soft and more manageable. I will purchase it again.I appreciated the email follow-up with suggestions.</li>
    <li> I started using the Argan Oil by Arvazallia one week ago. My hair ends were very dried, I already could notice less dry ends and more shine hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for this product as I&#x27;ve tried other oils before but after reading the reviews, I thought what the heck.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it!  It has helped my dry, damaged hair immensely.  My hair looks healthier now than it has in a long time (probably since my last keratin treatment!) It is also much softer.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Your hair will be happier each time you you use!  I could tell the difference in the first application.  It has a nice fragrance but I am sensitive to artificial scents.  I would prefer a fragrance free choice.  However, the quality and results of using this product is well worth.  I even had some sent to my daughter.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It made my dry hair shiny.</li>
    <li> smells great, and helps my hair. I can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This is terrible I ordered this it came in the mail broken and leaking.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!  Makes my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  It smells wonderful, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy feeling/looking, and has vastly improved the condition of my hair (especially the ends).  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Works great, hair looks, feels and smells great all the time.</li>
    <li> Great for your hair I use more than recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice , love the smell , but not that good</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis and it helps keep my hair from getting frizzy. It absorbs really well and smells nice.</li>
    <li> The oil is fine but the bottle is literally the worst bottle that I have ever seen.  I had to throw the entire thing in the garbage after barely using any of it because I took it on a trip. It leaked the entire way to Europe because the seal is faulty (this was a new bottle). After using it two or three times, the spray top came off inside the larger lid and is stuck there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine if you leave it at home and don&#x27;t put the lid on.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product! Love it, put in about 2-3 pumps in my hands and then rub it into my damp hair. Helps with detangling when I&#x27;m combing it out and makes my hair super soft! Love it! Thanks for the great product and prompt service!</li>
    <li> Used the product with the mask and it completely transformed my hair. My hair was dry, thin, and fried. Now it has volume, less split ends, soft and looks healthy. The oil on its own works great after shower when hair is still damp. It makes combing hair easier even when I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love it so much. It makes my hair shiny whether I straighten it or not. My roots are growing in silkier than before. Note I have very thick, FRIZZY, curlish hair (3c/4a, more 4a) and I can manage it with this oil added to my hair regime. I will of course continue to buy more. Thank you soooo much</li>
    <li> It makes hair soft and shiny. BUT is smells so strong, I can&#x27;t be in the same room with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My hair tangles as soon as water hits it and the Argan Oil worked wonders.  I will buy again.  I was very impressed that the seller sent and email on how to use.  Many kudos for their customer service.</li>
    <li> Smells disgusting and lingers. The oil barely made a difference and made my hair look dirty as if I hadn&#x27;t showered for a few days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. ..my girlfriends wants another bottle just as a back up</li>
    <li> The argan oil veels so soft on my skin. When I used it in my hair; it brought out the shine and presented a healthy hair look. I love it. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good oil for your hair. Not greasy and has a great smell.</li>
    <li> The price was great and I use it daily on my wet hair before I blow dry.  I bought it on the recommendations on Amazon and I love it.</li>
    <li> After about 3 weeks of use my fiancee&#x27;s exact words were &amp;#34;It&#x27;s really very, very good.  It makes my hair feel so silky smooth.&amp;#34;  We also appreciated the prompt shipping and the price.</li>
    <li> Been at 65% off today only now for at least a month. Nevertheless, Except for the fragrance, I like it. However, being a fella, I don&#x27;t particularly appreciate the feminine fragrance.</li>
    <li> I opened this only to have a hairline crack bust open and pour all over my bathroom counter and floor.  Needless to say I was not happy, but didn&#x27;t want to judge the product based on that.  I used a bit (off my counter ha ha) in my hair and it didn&#x27;t really do much for my thick, wavy, course hair.  I&#x27;ll continue to search for another Argan oil because I do believe there are superior brands out there.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to give my hair shine and body, mostly shine, but it left my hair limp and to soft , very oily and could not even style my hair after using it. If you have really dry hair it might work for you, but I have normal straight hair, and it was to oily for me. Would probably be good for flat iron use or course curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great Argan oil, I love it! I put it on after shower and it really makes difference. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> Nice product, it made my frizzy hair nice and wavy again. Has a very light scent which I like. Gives your hair a little shine . I put it directly on my comb or brush because my dry hands absorb it also.</li>
    <li> Really great stuff. You only need two tiny pumps to cover alot of hair. I use a flat iron every day so this has softened and protected my hair from damage</li>
    <li> Received today. Packaging wicked difficult to open. Wasted product in the process. Messy process and top wouldn&#x27;t come off as a result. Seems like the oil is high quality and nice to have. Will transfer to another bottle and yes will probably order again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see a difference.</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell!  I&#x27;m African American and never had a perm. So my hair is pretty thick and hard to manage. But this product helps a lot! I use is on damp hair before flat ironing and it works wonders! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an oil that was light, but an effective moisturizer. This works and smells great. It also does not leave a residue on your hair. I am an african american woman and sometimes I could use extra but with this product a little goes a long way. Even though it is expensive it is worth it. I will reorder when I need more</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The water here in Germany has high calcium rates and kills my curly hair. This argan oil had saved the day and makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a great experience with this oil! My hair is very dry, so I can use with my mask and after that.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair feeling very soft! One of the best oil treatments out there! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK and the smell is nice</li>
    <li> It was for my wife and she says it works so much better than she thought it would.</li>
    <li> I have used the oil treatment for one week and I am already loving it. I have oily hair and it had turned frizzy because of swimming. I used just a little oil after every shampoo (which I do alternate days) and it has really softened my hair without showing an oily scalp. Oh, and I love the smell too :) I am definitely coming back for more and will try other products from the seller too.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t use too much as it tends to make your hair look oily.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Leaves my hair so soft and shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has this and gave me half her bottle since I ordered it but didn&#x27;t receive the product I got a full refund but since I am able to I will do my review!!:) I absolutely love the smell of this.... personally I use as a leave In conditioner..... I generously apply to all of my hair and blow dry my hair and style it!! It helps my hair tremendously! ! I have done so much to my hair it&#x27;s fried and this oil leaves it looking so healthy. It does give a little oily appearance but it  builds and strengthens my dead and or split ends and make my hair look so healthy. This stuff is the gold and diamonds of hair products!!</li>
    <li> Works great for getting rid of frizz and tames down the hair.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Helps with tangling, smoothness, shine and it dries so fast, I don&#x27;t have to put a dryer to my hair. Helps prevent some damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never felt more inclined to write a review!! In fact, I believe this is a first. I bought both the conditioner and oil... All I can say is this stuff is ah-mazinggg! Never has anything made my hair so soft. I use relaxers btw... Just in awe!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday after blow drying my hair and it keeps my hair nice and sleek, I love the smell too</li>
    <li> I love the product but I find the pump delivery system frustrating. The first time I opened it, a bunch of oil leaked out as I tried to remove the plastic seal that prevented leaking during delivery. The bottle has become so slippery no matter how many times I&#x27;ve cleaned it up that I struggle to hold onto the bottle while I activate the pump. Also, such a minute amount comes out with each pump that it&#x27;s frustrating as well. I love the product so I gave it four stars. If I could review the delivery system I would give it one star.</li>
    <li> I have not used it very long but so far it really does keep my hair softer after washing.</li>
    <li> This product has my hair shining and my skin, very soft.</li>
    <li> Once you have used this oil, you will be addicted. Nothing has softened my hair like this oil. The product leaves your hair so shiny and soft. I dont use any other oils, this is &amp;#34;THE ONE&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> love this product!  it&#x27;s not greasy and feels great on the hair..shiny and smooth!  best when you apply to damp hair and let it naturally dries.  I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair anymore.</li>
    <li> Makes my daughter&#x27;s dry, curly hair soft &amp; manageable. Smells nice, too. A little goes a long way! My hair is straight &amp; fine, but colored. This helped the ends not looked overdried/processed from my drugstore color.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell,shines in hair !!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is good for straight or permed hair. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough for natural Black hair.</li>
    <li> This Hair Treatment is the boom. I love this product very much, the only thing the price is a little high for my taste.</li>
    <li> great, my hair looks so shine and healthy!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have been a fan of argan oil products for years now.  I always used One and Only Argan and thought i would try something different.  This makes my hair so soft and manageable especially with winter coming.  Even when I apply a little to dry hair to just smooth out my frizzies it never looks greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this oil because it is very light and gives my hair a nice sheen as well.  The smell is truly amazing and I just love it.  I was really surprised by this oil and I will purchase this again.  When my daughter&#x27;s hair gets dry, i just rub a little and massage it in her hair.  What a difference it makes, Please give this oil a try and you will be satisfied customer like me.</li>
    <li> I am currently in the process of growing out my hair, so to cut down on trims and still keep my hair (especially the ends) looking nice and healthy, I decided to try this product. It does not disappoint! I apply several pumps to my towel dried hair before styling, and then after blowing it dry I add a couple of more pumps concentrating on the ends before using the flat iron. My hair is shiny and smooth and looks and feels really healthy. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> ok well this company has done it again this product does everything they claim it will my hair was awful bleched blond used the mask and this oil for 2 weeks ...i am in love with my hair and these products</li>
    <li> It has been three weeks since I started using Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia Leave in Treatment and Conditioner. I use the product before I blow dry my hair every morning after shampooing my hair. I have noticed my hair being softer. I use the product instead of the hair conditioner and I like it very much. It does work!!!</li>
    <li> This hair oil is fantastic. Every time I use it there is a noticeable difference. My hair is softer and shinier. It also smells fantastic. I love using this oil -- highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nothing miraculous abouth this product as found by other reviewers, just an average oil, that smells good and do exactly the same than other brands.</li>
    <li> I love that I can use this product on wet or dry hair. My hair is so shiny and soft.  It&#x27;s simply amazing and smells incredible!</li>
    <li> I have been using the arganesque oil for about a month now for both me and my sons hair. We have kinky hair and it&#x27;s makes it very soft and easy to deal with. As soon as I finish washing our hair I use this oil and it&#x27;s so easy to comb through. Great product</li>
    <li> I love this!!! This works just like they say it does!!!  I will buy it again.... Life and&lt;br /&gt;Style goods is the best place to buy this product from!!!! they really have the best customer service.... thank you</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  I would buy again</li>
    <li> As an African American with color treated, fine hair, I find it difficult to find the right products that will leave a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking shine that is not greasy.  This product gives my hair that healthy look and feel. I love it. I have a bottle in use and a bottle on reserve.  It&#x27;s my new fave.</li>
    <li> I am amazed how wonderful this oil is. I have really fuzzy hair and just applying few drop makes it shiny and soft. like pure silk on your head.</li>
    <li> A great product in perfect packaging. I used it right away... Love the smell so much and it doesn&#x27;t fade, your hair will smell great even the next day. I bought it to treat my bleached hair, it&#x27;s only 3 days of use so far but I&#x27;m seeing improvements. Definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have dry and dull hair and have been looking for something to not only condition my hair but make it look healthy and shiny. I finally found the right product! I have used argan oil products on my skin so I figured why not try it on my hair. I can honestly say that after the first time using this product I noticed a huge difference in the way my hair felt and looked.  I have been using the product for about a week now and my hair is so healthy and shiny it looks like I have just stepped out of the salon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago and I see great results ! Not only has my nappy hair became smoother but it has become longer as well &#x27;</li>
    <li> My colored, fine hair always need some level of styling-leave it to air dry, frizz, or style it with product, a little less frizz but still frizz.Not with this product.The first day I used it it looked like I just came from the salon and I am really untalented when it comes to styling my hair so, for me, that is amazing!Love this product.Giving it to all my girlfriends for Xmas.</li>
    <li> Have to use a VERY little bit or hair gets gooey and greasy looking.</li>
    <li> I like it, it smells good, n is good for the hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product....It made my hair so much softer</li>
    <li> Quick shipping..product works great and smells great</li>
    <li> Misleading advertising is my main complaint. They don&#x27;t post ingredients to the product description, and Argan Oil is the FIFTH ingredient. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient is cyclopentasiloxane, which is basically a silicone-based lubricant. I don&#x27;t trust the stuff. There&#x27;s research that says it&#x27;s safe. But that research doesn&#x27;t necessarily prove it doesn&#x27;t have long-term bad effects. I&#x27;m also concerned that it might do some things that the research wouldn&#x27;t call harmful, but that I&#x27;d still find undesirable (long-term drying of skin. Clogging of pores. Stuff like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the product itself, if you want something to add sheen to your hair without adding weight, it seems to accomplish that. Silicone lubricant is very light stuff, relatively. Good luck ever washing it out, though. BUT for me, I want some weight to my hair product, so even if I was okay with the deceptive description, I wouldn&#x27;t like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product has a BOATLOAD of reviews, and none of them referenced this problem until more recently. I really think that the Arvazalia company probably cheated the review system somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and here&#x27;s the full list of ingredients, which I copy/pasted from the comments of another review. I checked them against what&#x27;s on the package that I got:&lt;br /&gt;cyclopentasiloxane&lt;br /&gt;dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;cyclomethicone&lt;br /&gt;butylphenyl methylpropional&lt;br /&gt;argania spinosa kernel oil (argan oil)&lt;br /&gt;linseed (linum usitatissimum) extract&lt;br /&gt;fragrance supplement&lt;br /&gt;CI 47000 yellow no 11&lt;br /&gt;CI 26100 red no 17&lt;br /&gt;coumarin&lt;br /&gt;benzyl benzoate&lt;br /&gt;alpha isomethyl ionone</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Leaves my hair soft and frizz free (mostly) after blow drying. I have yet to see any new split ends, but I&#x27;ve only been using this product two weeks or so.</li>
    <li> I use this oil religiously.  It smells nice and leaves my hair looking so rich and smooth.  I have very coarse hair and it&#x27;s really prone to split ends but I think this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Made my fine hair greasy with even the most minute amount.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff is a little thick and heavy, you need to use only a little.  What I do is heat it a little bit in the mircrowave to thin it out before using so that my hair will not feel oily and weighed down.  It gives it great sheen and leaves hair manageable.</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling soft and manageable. it is a great product and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wow. I have tried numerous other oils and this is amazing. you get what you pay for. Bigger than expected and don&#x27;t have to use too much</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smelling great  and help me to get rid of my frizzy and dull hair.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I have well water and the iron content in my water is high.  I never had frizzy/damaged hair until I started washing my hair in this water.  The damage and frizz has continued to get worse. I ordered the Arvazallia Argon oil just to try it out.  So glad that I did.  Have only used it twice and the damage is starting to repair. The frizz is going away. My hair is starting to look healthier.  Another great feature is this this oil doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your hair.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Calms my frizz and makes my hair soft and manageable. Was worried that the oil would breakout my sensitive skin but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product!!! Best hair oil I have ever used!</li>
    <li> oil smells great, but its not as thick as a high quality argan oil. I am not sure if this is a pure blend. also it did not absorp into my skin after i applied it. IT felt very weird like the slime form okra</li>
    <li> Great product for hair, especially for those of us in dry, cold winter areas.  I have fine blonde hair, use the oil after shampooing and before drying.  Makes it much more manageable.  I also put it on at night before bed on dry hair.  I wake up with hair that isn&#x27;t stuck out all over the place.  It does not make my fine hair look greasy or dirty at all.  Comes in a good sized bottle.  Over all, I am extremely pleased with it and will order it again.</li>
    <li> This hair care product is wow!! I love this product.I have very frizzy and dry hair and this product solve my permanent problem.One of the best Argan Oil treatment. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this light oil! I use just a squirt daily, rub between my hands and run my hands through my hair; it adds shine and keeps my hair very soft! I can&#x27;t prove it, but I also think it has helped with my hair growth. If Im showering, I add the oil, put on a shower cap and then have my shower.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my daughter. But her hair is super dry and it didn&#x27;t really work to good on hers. But on mine it makes my hair shiny and smell great.</li>
    <li> Love it! make damaged hair look great and gives it so much shine</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t live without this product. It makes my hair super soft, silky and manageable even after dying and bleaching it uncountable times. Reordered it the 2nd, 3rd time and it definitely will not be my last! I love this so much!!</li>
    <li> The product was sold at a reasonable price and is certainly a luxury item that lives up to its claims.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and a lot of it...I put 4 pumps of the ArganEsque Argan Oil for Hair into my hands and rub them together...then hand-comb it throughout my hair.  My hair dries significantly faster and I have less tangling in the process.  The added bonus is the scent...it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> This is great.  Great smell.  It&#x27;s helped with My hair growth.  I reviewed a lot of different oils and hair growth products, this seemed to heal My bad scalp.  It&#x27;s the great fragrance that I love, and the results are awesome.</li>
    <li> The product has a pleasant smell, and it makes my hair feel soft, more manageable and less frizzy.  I will likely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product has a very faint smell.  It&#x27;s hard to use the pump application and you only get a tiny drop.  As for the quality, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than cheap Aragon oil except its nicely packaged appearance which does not do my hair any good.</li>
    <li> A little does go a long way, I really like how it works.  It&#x27;s not heavy, for me I still need the blow dryer after I apply it to help it sink in and really reduce frizz.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of argan oil was from amazon but it was a 1.5 oz bottle for quite a bit of money and the product did not really have a smell.  Well... I&#x27;ve finished that bottle and I moved on to this Argan OIl by Arvazallia.... WOW... WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! This product is exceptional to my first purchase.  First of all, the size of this product for the price is top notch!!!  This is a 3.4 oz and you only use like 1 squirt per application... two at most if you have longer hair.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the price vs. the quantity that you get.  Secondly, this company takes great CARE in the packaging. My box was plastic sealed and then the botle itself was plastic sealed.  They really protect their product in the shipping process!!! Lastly, the smell, in my opinion is exceptional!!! Very nice and clean.  I only smell it on my hands when I&#x27;m applying it to my hair.  After it&#x27;s on my hair I don&#x27;t smell it at all.  I have not gotten comments from people around me saying they can smell my hair, so that&#x27;s good.  It leaves my hair shiny, less frizzy and to my tastes... very managable.  I will order again.....HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> The oil is not too heavy or light, it helps to bring shine to my hair. My only complain is the shape of the bottle and the pump. The bottle is hard to grab and the pump does not work very well, Sometimes, it takes more than 10 pumps to get the oil out.</li>
    <li> I have heavily processed hair.  My hair is colored and I have, in the past, had Keratin treatments.  I wanted to give my hair a break from the Keratin this fall/winter and decided to try this product.  At first I was a little skeptical as I haven&#x27;t had to use oils in the past and I really didn&#x27;t know how greasy or weighed down my hair would look after applying.  My hair is past my shoulders, but not at my bra line, so I really didn&#x27;t know how many pumps of the oil I should use.  I started with 4 and then upped it to 10 pumps.  WOW!!  At first, of course it&#x27;s an oil, it goes on really greasy.  However, when I blow dried each section of hair, it seemed like the oil just melted away, leaving nothing but silkiness, softness and an incredible shine, just as if I had a Keratin treatment.  My hair did not look weighed down or greasy and it sure did smell good.  I am so happy I bought this product.  As with everything, not only should your hair treatment be top of the line but your blow dryer should be too, they go hand in hand. So for the skeptics, try it you will not be disappointed.  I also purchased the hair mask, but have not tried it yet, I know though, that I will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is good to give shine to dull hair. It smells good too :) The product was shipped quickly and arrived as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The oil is too perfumed for my liking. I would have appreciated a coconut scent or something of the sort, but it smells like cheap perfume. It does a good job of taming fly away hairs and is very light- doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long hair. I like the functionality, but I could do with a lighter smell.</li>
    <li> Best argan oil I have used. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and provides manageability when drying.&lt;br /&gt;the big plus! It&#x27;s a big bottle for the price!</li>
    <li> Wow that&#x27;s all I can say incredible</li>
    <li> I like this very much, I just wished that they sold an unscented version.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very light oil. It smoothes my hair and makes it smell wonderful.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my husband about a week ago but wanted to wait until I tried it to post a review. I am deducting one star because while it does give my hair a shine to me it looks more greasy then shiny. That being said I have been using it as a repairing treatment by following the instructions, put it in and leave it on for 30 minutes then wash it out, and it has worked wonderfully. My hair seems softer and less frizzy. The smell isn&#x27;t over powering as some have said unless you use a lot in an enclosed space. I put it on in the bathroom with the door open and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I have think curly hair and it takes about 20 pumps to get it through all of it but because you get a lot for the price it should last me approximately 2 or 3 months but I will be ordering it again when I get low.</li>
    <li> this oil does not leave your hair feeling greasy. it&#x27;s so lovely!</li>
    <li> bought this along with the Mask for my GF. leave in after drying hair to style it and your hair will be soft all day !</li>
    <li> Leaves hair oily even when only one drop is used as directed.  Does help smooth and shine hair.  Hair feels soft.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair, so can&#x27;t use it during the day.  I put it on at night and wash it out in the morning.  Can&#x27;t really say it makes my hair shine, just make it look greasy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected and works great.</li>
    <li> makes my long hair shinny and less fly away.</li>
    <li> All you have to use are a  few drops and you will see in that instant how shiny your hair looks,  plus it also gets so silky! !!! And doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  Try it , you will love it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say if I actually liked this product because it came broken and leaked all over the box. I never actually got to use it but was very disappointed with how it arrived broken.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very great product. Smells good and makes the hair nice shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best thing that has ever happened to my hair.. my hair has always been dry and I was looking for something to tame my hair.. I tried to give it a shot oil and I instantly felt that my hair was smooth and was very manageable just after  first application. My hair feels so much softer and silkier. . Just squeeze out 3 pumps of oils and put it all over your hair especially at the ends and leave it.. in few minutes comb your hair and you will notice that it de tangles your hair too.. which is awesome if you have long hair like mine... I say this is a must for everyone who wants awesome natural hair.  By the way it smells great too !</li>
    <li> Very good treatment... leaves my hair healthy looking and not oily</li>
    <li> This has been a hair life saver! I&#x27;m currently overseas and the water here is killer so my hair was drying out. I ordered this and the argan oil leave in conditioner and within days I could already start to see improvements. I will continue to use this even after I redeploy.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It makes me forget how damaged my hair was. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair looks and feels so much more healthy. It is once again shiny and so much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as ordered.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> This along with the Argan Mask is absolutely fantastic. I am going to purchase again...Don&#x27;t want to run out of these products! My hair is so soft and just looks so much better!</li>
    <li> None greasy very lite keeps my hair moist and soft love it definitely recommend this and the hair mask</li>
    <li> Best product for your hair to fight that dry winter hair.  Also very good at taming the frizz in curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t have that greasy look or feel, just great soft hair!</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  It is great for my hair!</li>
    <li> Chose this product after reading reviews and am not disappointed. Have used numerous hair serums from drug store brands to salon products. This is by far the best. Thought it was a bit expensive when ordered it but it is a generous supply and should last a long time. If you compare cost and quantity to the other products out there, this one is actually a bargain. And it does nice things for your hair.</li>
    <li> At first I was kind of skeptical that this hair oil could really be high quality because of the low price----basically a fraction of what you pay in fancy salons for products, and definitely cheaper than the more highly advertised Morocain Oil--which really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I was like--how good could it be if I&#x27;ve never even heard of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it turned out totally awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real secret to getting the most out of this oil is to make sure you put it on DAMP hair, then it has a chance to work it&#x27;s magic and change the texture of your hair from frizzy/curly to silky/smooth.  Then I also apply it to dry hair once it&#x27;s styled just to lock in a few stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive, you can also afford to have a bottle at home, and keep a bottle in your desk at work, and it smells great too!!!  I&#x27;ve even gotten away from having to use a flat iron because it works so well. Would totally recommend.</li>
    <li> One of the very few products I have purchased that reduces frizz while producing shines and healthy looking hair. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes my hair very shiny and frizz free. The only downfall is the bottle they send it in. I had it for three days and accidentally dropped it. It shattered completely. Fortunately I was able to save some and put it in a Johnson and Johnson small bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited to leave a review until after I&#x27;d had a chance to use it for awhile. After using it for a couple of months now, I can safely say, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d given my daughter, who has very long, full hair, a bottle for Christmas last year. She used the bottle up in 7 months and begged for more. I didn&#x27;t realize she&#x27;d quit using conditioner once she started using Argan Oil. I, too, no longer need conditioner for my thick hair. A little of this wonderfully smelling oil leaves my hair soft and flowing for days. It never looks oily, which can happen with conditioner after a day or two of not washing my hair, but not with the Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with the condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but they do have sales, during which I&#x27;ll buy it. It&#x27;s absolutely fabulous, as is the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a minor issue with our first order and the company immediately went above and beyond to fix the issue to our complete satisfaction. They have followed up with us on each order. So rare in today&#x27;s culture where customer service has taken a back seat. I&#x27;m sold on Argan Oil and Arvazallia. (And no, they didn&#x27;t pay me for this endorsement or offer me anything for this endorsement.)</li>
    <li> Product is ok, my hair seems to soak up more of it than the Redken one that I usually buy.  It does contain alcohol so it could contribute to dryness.  I will probably give to my kids.  The main reason for the one star is that the straw that brings the product up to the pump is so long that the top was not screwed on to the bottle at all.  The product was packed well in the box and was shrink wrapped.  As soon as I broke the cellophane, about 10% of the product spilled.  Was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Leave hair soft and shiny and I love the way it smells.  Ordered an extra bottle to have on hand.  I like to use it on my skin also.</li>
    <li> it is a good product.  I don&#x27;t like the fact it has \\&quot;CONES\\&quot; silicone derivatives in it.  That being said it is very lightweight!  Really for me you can&#x27;t really use too much as happens with other types of products like this.  This makes it worth it if you are doing a lot of styling.  I am cutting my long hair off (waist) to shoulder length today in fact!  And so I will use this product more when I am doing more styling and update soon.</li>
    <li> Works great! Not oily or weighty at all!</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Not greasy</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful! It smells amazing and is very light. It&#x27;s perfect for my fine hair and my daughter&#x27;s thick/curly hair. I will definitely purchase again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> it is a very good oil. not at all sticky, very light. Keeps my hair very shiny/silky, it has also reduced my hair fall. However i am yet to see any new hair growth. i do recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> This product is working really well for my hair texture - Black African decent. When applied to wet hair, you instantly feel the difference and it makes the detanglling process very smooth and effortless and hardly any hair being pulled. When applied to dry hair, which I do every other day, it keeps it shiny, silky, and smooth yet not oily or heavy. Perfect for all kind of styles - natural, curly, flat iron etc. I have tried other Argan Oil brands and this is by far the best. And it has a very pleasing light scent which is a plus as I am very allergic to most hair products&#x27; scents. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST AT CALMING DOWN MY FRIZZY HAIR</li>
    <li> I love this product. In the past, I never had a problem with frizz, but because of hormones, medication, or something I started getting the worst frizz ever. My hair look fried at the roots. Having red hair doesn&#x27;t help in keeping frizz inconspicuous. I tried many products, some of which worked a bit, but nothing seemed to keep the frizz down. This helped more than most things. I use about three or four squirts, rub it in my hands, and the then work it into my scalp, roots, and down to the tip. I rub all the oil off my hands by by rubbing it throughout my hair, which is pretty long. I use it in conjunction with VO5 Detangle and Shine, and it works great. I blow dry my hair or flat iron it (even though it is naturally straight) right before my hair dries. My hair is shiny and I don&#x27;t have any many problems with frizz after I brush it out dry a couple of times, so this product will help bad frizz.</li>
    <li> It worked well with my course hair.  It gave it&#x27;s soft &amp; silky texture.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair with heavy oil residue but with a shine.</li>
    <li> My son uses this for his curly hair that is prone to get frizzy.  It works well for him.  I bought him a second bottle thinking he would be out of it, but he wasn&#x27;t even half way through the first bottle, even though he uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> I had left a review about the Argan Oil for my hair.  I mentioned that the pump did not work too good.  The product was good.  Without asking the company sent me another bottle and it works great.  It is refreshing to see that a company without having to ask cares enough about their rating that they went out of their way to see I was satisfied and I am.  I will do business with this company again and would highly recommend them to anyone.  They stand behind their product without fail.  I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I love that its in a glass bottle! The product works well, my hair feels softer and smells nice after use. I wish there was less time i had to keep it on my hair (30min) is a little long for my morning routine. Overall i am pretty happy</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair is healthy and shiney after using this oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair soft and gives it body.</li>
    <li> Through all my Christmas shopping on Amazon, this is the only product that truly deserves a five star. I read the other reviewers and I was still skeptic. Could this &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; really make my unmanageable hair silky? Yes! It restored my hair to life. I only wish they made a bigger bottle cause my hair is soaking it all up!</li>
    <li> In the past I used another Moroccan oil product  but it&#x27;s always been very expensive.  I decided to give this brand a try and I love it.  I get the same results as the pricy product for a lot less money.  I&#x27;m so happy I discovered this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My hair is soft and smooth- I like it!  I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  Just would rather have a pump bottle.  It&#x27;s a little hard to get amount needed by pushing the little spray thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allyson Nelson</li>
    <li> This is an excellent price for a very good product. I&#x27;ve used other natural leave-in conditioners but they always felt like I was putting something on my hair that should be rinsed out -- they were heavy and/or oily. However, when I use the argan oil -- and it only takes a few drops as I wear my hair very short -- the smell is pleasant and not too strong, and it makes (and keeps) my hair very soft without a heavy feel. I&#x27;ve been very impressed and will very likely order it again, although that likely won&#x27;t be a while as a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> This product works as stated. It took my dry, over processed and brittle hair and turned it to a shiny, soft, manageable miracle.</li>
    <li> The product makes your hair very soft! Love it! The sellers are prompt and provide how to use it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently went to a hair salon that damaged my hair with over processing.  My hair was in the worst shape of my life, and I needed help right away!  I did some quick research, and learned that argan oil and other argan-based products were the way to go to help fix split-ends that also had breakage.  I noticed the exceptional deal provided by Arvazallia, and hoped that this product (along with the hair mask in the jar --I needed help!) would do the trick.  I could not believe the difference after using both products for 1-2 weeks!!  You only need to use these once or twice a week, but my hair visually looks a lot better and is back on the mend.  I plan on using these products on a regular basis in the future, just for maintenance.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A FAIR PRICE.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes  my hair a little more shiny and it smells nice, but I think I will try a different brand next time. It&#x27;s good, but I think if you spend a little more you might find better.</li>
    <li> This product sucks! does not work with my hair</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly 3c. This helped me so much. My hair was fried and split from chemicals and hair color. Nothing gave me moisture. I tried redken, coconut oil and and every type of revival leave in. Love it. My hair is moist and healthy</li>
    <li> Excellent product I purchased two bottles for both myself and my husband.  My husbands hair felt like Straw before he started using the product.  I smells great does not weight the hair down. Best hair decision you can make..</li>
    <li> My hair is softer than it&#x27;s been in years!</li>
    <li> Keeps the hair smooth and shiny...really like it. would recommend to if your hair gets really frizzy like mine especially in summer.</li>
    <li> Someone else said it smells amazing and I agree fully.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as thick as another argon oil I have used, so it&#x27;s easy to get a good amount of that wonderful scent without causing the hair to look greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product to use before , during, or after styling.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Huge bottle and actually does what it says on the label.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and frizzy.. when I applied it the product it left my hair soft smelling good and with a healthy look&lt;br /&gt;. Frizziness was on lock down and I was able to show off my natural curls... I recommend it</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes hair look great when blown dried into hair for styling, if you air dry it does seem to leave residue which is nice. Only complaint, haven&#x27;t seen any result in the aspect of health at all and have been using as directed for 3 months. I would buy this again, mainly for the nice shine it gives my hair, but not as a treatment.</li>
    <li> This is just really great hair oil.  Whenever I use it the shine in my hair is great.  I really feel like it&#x27;s helping my hair and I Hope that is true.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, sometimes I like to straight it with flat iron, I use a little amount of oil before and after, my hair looks shiny and healthy. Some other times I like my waves and let it air dry, I have used the oil to easy tangles it works great, however once my hair is dry it looks like the oil had been totally absorved leaving my hair looking dry and freezy.</li>
    <li> In terms of the oil, I would give this product 5 stars. Unfortunately, when I opened the package (which was not padded nearly enough for a product that came in such a fragile bottle), the bottle was smashed at the top. When I unwrapped the bottle, it imploded!&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is wonderful though! The best hair oil I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton. I have very fine hair that gets oily at the roots and dry and frizzy at the ends, and this product makes it smooth and healthy but never weighs it down or makes it look oily. I always use it on my hair after my shower while it&#x27;s still damp, and even when I think I used too much it still dries perfect! Not only does it make my hair super smooth and shiny, it also makes it feel sooo soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly my favorite hair product of all time. Would definitely recommend, but have a spare jar or something lying around just in case it comes with the bottle broken.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this keeps the fly away under control. I have to be careful how much I use, or I have to wash my hair every day.</li>
    <li> I like the oil, it leaves my hard soft. I love the detangled power it has, I used it in my damp or dry hair and is so easy to style. is really nice but im not sure if is helping me with my dry scalp. It did make me break out badly on my scalp but I guess is normal since isan oily product. The shipping company they used this time left the box outside my door without care that&#x27;s why I took a star off. In the other hand the customer service is really nice. The wrote me an email following my purchase, the delivery, and the results. I really feel warm for this. Definitely buying again for the product and the costumer service. (:</li>
    <li> This product is top notch. It leaves my hair shiny &amp; sleek without weighing it down or making it look greasy. It also smells delicious. This will be on my full time hair care kit!</li>
    <li> The item arrived yesterday, I was so excited until I pumped a drop on to my fingertip....  It has a strong cheap-powdery scent.  I thought, let me try it first before thinking negatively.  So I pumped out one more drop and rub it in to a section of my hair.  Big mistake!  I was bothered all day by the smell.  It has gotten worse and worse through out the day that I began to feel nauseous.  Finally, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to notice any improvement of my hair (of course).  However, just by the initial application, I felt that it is like any other hair treatment product that targets frizzes.  And if you buy those products in Walmart, you will only pay a fraction of this price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the hair treatment about two weeks ago and love the way it makes my hair feel and look. I would recommend this produt to anybody that uses heat to their hair it really works.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 2weeks now. I like it so far. Does what it says. Keeps my dead splitends looking a little softer. I basically like the concept of a leave in oil.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and hopefully will help with hair loss too. Will recommend it.</li>
    <li> She was so pleased with this Arran oil! She has long thick hair. Needless to say, she irons, curls, and abuses her hair.  This gives her the protection she needs to maintain vibrant gorgeous, flowing locks!</li>
    <li> I just received this Argan Oil and have already used it several times.  I also have a heat cap and put the oil on and sit with the cap on it for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for conditioning hair before a color treatment.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I have very difficult hair. Like I have 3x as much hair as most people. It is thick, curly, and dry. I use a lot of product on my hair just to manage it, but it will still get slightly frizzy.  I think this product will probably work on most people&#x27;s hair but not mine. I am still searching for hair products for my hair, and I am disappointing that this one didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t regret buying it and I think to most people it will work just fine but not me.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product. My hair loves it and so do I..:-) Thank You!!</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, the moment I put it on I can feel my hair get smooth and silky. I put it on damp hair and then again once it dries. Awesome, I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super shiny without weighing it down!</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil for about 8 months or so now and love it. The other brands seem to leave my hair really oily, so I just rub in it my washed hair at night and get up in the am and wet again and it works fine.  With this, I have been using it every morning when I am getting ready for work and it does not make it to oily at all.  This is my second bottle.  I have also used on my Aunt&#x27;s hair and she is also a believer now.  She has even ordered for her friends. Thanks,</li>
    <li> Use every other day and it keeps my tangled hair very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Good product!  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing Best oil out there !!!!! I&#x27;m in love I have very thin hair and this does miracles u won&#x27;t regret buying it I promise!!!! Better the morrocan oil same price !!</li>
    <li> Little bit more oily than I expected.. but like it</li>
    <li> I bought this to tame my frizzy hair - it does a decent job and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> Definitely going to purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this product. Use it religously every day on my very long hair. It helps with the frizzy ends and fly away hairs yet is light and does not weigh my hair down, just makes it soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> It seems to work very well. Hair is much softer and so far seems to be healthy. Does not appear to be a fake product, it actually works.</li>
    <li> Leaving my Hair silky smooth and frizz free... great product and worth the price. A few drops go a long way..&lt;br /&gt;one of my favs!!!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is okay... The smell is okay, not as intoxicating as people made it out to be in the reviews. Paul Mitchell&#x27;s super skinny serum works waaaaay better!!</li>
    <li> Arvazallia Argan oil for hair treatment is the best Argan oil treatment that I have used in my hair to date it has a very pleasant scent it is light aqqqqnd easily absorbs into my hair without making it oily or greasy. My hair is smoother, softer and silkier and brushes and combs out easily and still retains its curl. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product.  I am very satisfied with how it makes my hair feel, so silky and soft.  My hair is thick with some natural curl and in humid weather can become quite a mess.  I still have some humidity effects but not as severe when using the Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> The pump broke so I could not use it so I had to rub it in my hand then Tito my hair that a mess because it&#x27;s a thick product</li>
    <li> Love the smell and that I can put it on many times a day without oiliness.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for a few years now, lately been going the blond way and as a result my hair has been very dry and normal on the stand hair products just made the situation worst, so started to look for other solution, came across a few reviews that praised the quality and effective result, ordered and arrived just on time. Bought this together with the hair mask and have been using it for two weeks now and the results have been amazing. my hair no longer look like someone killed it! i&#x27;m so happy! it&#x27;s really not as oily as i thought it would be, more like silky and the smell is super nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I love it, no complaints.  Does not make my hair greasy at all.  For reference I have long thick somewhat coarse/dry hair that is subjected to highlights and I think this does a nice job making my hair soft and smooth.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff will last you forever! It works very welland does not leave my hair looking or feeling greasy. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I can drag my finger through my hair after shower with only two pumps of the oil, no pulling whatsoever. This oil is amazingly good. My husband love the way my hair smell. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle to stock up. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this. It&#x27;s honestly pretty good. My hair is less frizzy and I&#x27;ve used multiple products.</li>
    <li> Works ok and smells great. The only part I don&#x27;t like is all the silicone. You can feel it on your hands there is so much. Not sure it would be good for your hair if you used it too much.</li>
    <li> Just the lovely smell by itself is enough to want to keep this stuff on hand.  But it does make my hair softer and shinier...Looks like it will last for quite a while so even tho it is a little expensive up front, it&#x27;s worth the cost for a little pampering.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff! My hair feels so soft! will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Just what I have read from all the reviews, my hair came out shiny and smooth upon using it most esp after hair drying. Happiness!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old guy with white, shoulder length hair and with the white hair, I need to use some shampoo&#x27;s that &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; out the yellow color left from the shampoo and water.  When I do that, my hair looks like it was attacked by static electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really helps, if you have dry hair that needs a little gentleness...this is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I like this product, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I bought it EXPRESSLY in lieu of other spray leave-ins I use. The directions on this discuss deep conditioning as in shampooing it out and using it for fly aways but nowhere does it say it is just a leave it and also it is WAY too heavy to be a  leave in. I wish they&#x27;d stop billing it as this as it isn&#x27;t like other leave ins.</li>
    <li> See my review on the shampoo product page.  Apply this to the ends first, then if you like distribute throughout.  A little bit (2-3 pumps) goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The oil is light, and very concentrated at the same time. A little goes a long way especially on thick hair.  I would recommend a monthly purchase!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over 3 months now, overall it is very moisturizing and helps control the frizz, hair feels very smooth and less statics, but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell &#x3D;(  It&#x27;s too strong, like overly scented makeup/ cream?  I had to use it when my hair is half wet and blow dry it so the smell is not that overpowering....</li>
    <li> delivery was fast and I started using the oil right away after taking a shower . my hair was dry and weak ,with the oil everyday I noticed results right away ,my hair is no longer dry after 3 weeks ,and now it is growing in thicker and richer .thank you ..</li>
    <li> i noticed a difference in my hair the first time i used argan oil.  i love using it right before coloring my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is a dream. Obviously the argan oil is the main reason but it also smells dreamy. Skin feels so much better. Plus for hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Smells great and limited frizz even at the beach! It gives a nice shine as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using Argan oil shampoo and conditioner, and this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; afterward.  My hair has gotten very dry (due to a recently diagnosed vitamin deficiency), and I bought into the hype about Argan oil.  Soy Renewal by Healthy Sexy Hair works better at a better price.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Gripe:  I bought the shampoo and conditioner together here through Amazon, and this Argan oil through Amazon as well.  And my e-mail box has been filled with notes from the manufacturers.  I finally got rid of them after unsubscribing four or five times, but would like to know how they got my e-mail address since Amazon stocks and sells these products.</li>
    <li> This is a great size bottle.  I use two pumps in my hair daily for shine.</li>
    <li> I originally tried a version of this a few months ago when I got my hair cut last and loved it. The person at the hair salon recommended I look into this specific brand and I was a bit skeptical because of the price.  Surprisingly enough it worked just as well as the salon style and lasts for several days. The bottle is larger than expected as well, and you only need to use a tiny amount on your hair to get the needed effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer applying it to my hair when it is damp and massaging it in, though you can apply it to dry hair as well.  When your hair is dry it is harder to evenly spread throughout your hair and some areas might get a bit over oiled.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I was very satisified with the oil and the bottle is very attractive I can leave it on my vanity.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 months now. I wanted to love it but it&#x27;s just okay for me. I did not see any noticeable difference with my hair. But I do have to say that the seller was great. They followed up with me after I purchased and when they found out that the pump was defective they automatically sent a replacement. Unfortunately I will probably go back to using Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment.</li>
    <li> would only recommend if you don&#x27;t mind a cloying perfume scented product. Did try the oil once and seems to work well de frizzing curly hair  due to allergies this hair oil did not work for me so ended on passing on to a friend..</li>
    <li> I purchased the Argan Mask Conditioner and loved the results so I purchased the oil and now I am in love!  This oil is fantastic!  My hair feels so silky where it was looking dull and dry.  I have not done the oil treatment yet, I just added a few drops to my hair while dry to test and see how it will work and I loved the results.  I can&#x27;t wait to do the full oil treatment.  Highly recommend this product to anyone that has dull and dry hair, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> This is the 4th day I use this oil and so far so good.  I hope to see good results.</li>
    <li> Garbage.  Utterly inferior product.  Of no value whatsoever.  This purchase has convinced me:  I will never again buy a health and beauty item on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been burned too many times.  Many, if not most, listings are flooded with fake five-star reviews that suckers, such as myself, have fallen for.  Please read all one-star reviews before you click &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Argan oils I have tried and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little nervous about spending so much on a little bottle, but when I first used it I was blown away. I often dye my hair, with the occasional bleaching thrown in. Add a dry climate and I end up with rough, frizzy hair that makes no one happy. But one application of this with shampoo and my hair is the softest it has even been. I use it about once every two weeks, more often if I feel like it is getting too bad. But it lasts a lot longer than I expected it would. This is going to be a lifelong purchase of mine.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil work grate on my sons hair but leave my hair a little dry but soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!  I&#x27;m older, my hair is long and dry and brittle. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair is now bright, shining, and manageable. It also helps my color, red, stay bright and strong.  I did the color the other fir the first time in 2 months and put several drops of this into the solution. The color came out brilliant, and glistening. Very happy. Finally, something that works like it says it will.</li>
    <li> Helped my extremely dry hair have more body.  But makes my hair go flat after a day of use.  Have to wash hair daily when using this product.  So now have started using it only 2 times a week.  It did help my hair out though.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very coarse, frizzy and dry hair-unfortunately- and this product helps tame all of those problems. Although it is an oil it does not leave your hair greasy. It smells great too. The customer service is wonderful as they follow up with you to make sure you are truly happy with their product. Nothing bad to say at all about this product or the seller.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came quick.</li>
    <li> I love this product its so perfect&lt;br /&gt;Its natural and very nice smell very soft in  the hand use it daily</li>
    <li> My wife and I are in our sixties and it makes our hair look younger and more alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also feels good on the skin. similar to a hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third time I have got the Argan oil .  Like it !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, leaves my hair shiny without weight it down or making it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Love it definitely buying again</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for about a year now. I decided to try this product based on the reviews and I have to say that I really like it. I have long, blonde highlighted hair and my hair feels silkier and has less flyaways. I&#x27;m very pleased with how my hair looks and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The oil is great. I use it in my hair and on my body. The packaging is flawed. The automizer (plastic button the dispenses the drop of oil) on one bottle was broken and I could not use it with opening the cap.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because of all the reviews but my hair didn&#x27;t feel great while using it. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like this oil treatment. I will rate as a 5 if it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. I put two pumps and still make my hair greasy so now I&#x27;m trying just one pump.  That works better and best of all - the bottle last longer. This is the best oil treatment so far I&#x27;ve come across.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works great  I have fine thin dry hair and  it works wonders</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is very effective.  My hair is not straight or curly and it is always frizzy.  When I applied the oil, my hair felt much softer and much of the frizz was deminished.</li>
    <li> Really good product. I just started to use it and it smells really good plus it leaves your hair soft and shiny. I washed my hair and put the product while my hair was damp. Next day hair was soft and not freezy at all. I guess it will depend on each person, but for me it works.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but cut my hair extremely short and so have given it to my daughter, who really loves the smell and how nice her hair is behaving these days!</li>
    <li> I bought this solely on the 399 positive reviews. When I got it I had already washed my hair the night before so I applied it to dry hair. Paying attention to the ends only cause thats my problem area. It seemed to help some. I washed my hair the next night and did the leave-in treatment. After I applied to wet hair &amp; let my hair air dry as always. It looked was too greasy, so I rewahed it out &amp; tried less product to my hair &amp; didnt use any other serums. Im still trying to find the right amount for my hair. It not severely damaged. I cut off almost all the dead last month. As on now, its not my HG product. Im still looking for that. I do notice some added softness &amp; some shine but not the miracles others reported. I have only used it 3xs so maybe after a few more uses I&#x27;ll better understand how much to use on my hair. I love its smell. Kinda smells like Revlon&#x27;s fire &amp; ice perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I recieved a very nice email from the customer service giving me advice for using this. After trying different amounts &amp; being very careful to distribute it just where my hair needs it I now love this product. Ive added to my hair color mixture &amp; did the leave-in treatment. I can definitely tell when I dont use this product now. Ive already purchased a second bottle so I dont run out. Im going to also get some for my daughter, her hair is very over processed from bad dye jobs. It is now my HG hair treatment &amp; if you try it &amp; aren&#x27;t satisfied at first keep using it. It works.</li>
    <li> Great oil, you will see the difference next day if you apply it in the night</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Great customer service !  Smells great.  This is my new go to product.  I spare no expense on hair care products and this one is not only reasonably priced, it is a quality product!</li>
    <li> Works great! I put it in my hair wet (two small squirts) after a shower and blow dry and it works great.  Also great to put on 30 minutes before a shower to really saturate the hair.  Smells fantastic, but not strong.  Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Great ! Smells great feels great. Used for myself and daughter.</li>
    <li> i love it . my hair was very dry now it is soft and managable</li>
    <li> I think I have about 10 different hair oils in my bathroom cabinet. This is the one that I use all the time now, Leaves my hair smooth, soft and silky. My hair is very dry, but this helps it stay hydrated</li>
    <li> Great service and wonderful product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews about how it helped thin, fine hair.  It does make my hair really soft.  It takes some time to find out how much to use. Too little and your hair will still be frizzy.  Too much and it will be flat and greasy looking.  I use it at night after my shower to soften my hair so it doesn&#x27;t end up frizzing by morning, and very little in the morning before I use a hair product to style my hair.  This seems to work best for me.  Without hair product (gel, mousse etc.) in my hair, it is too soft to style.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for softening your hair and it exudes a delightful scent after applying</li>
    <li> absolutely did nothing for my hair</li>
    <li> Love this smells great feels great and an awesome price.</li>
    <li> My hair felt very soft and fresh after applying the oil</li>
    <li> I hate the way this smells!</li>
    <li> YES, Argan Oil is a miracle for dull, dry, damaged hair.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  But note:  this Argan Oil is no greater than any other, and you can buy Argan Oil for your hair at Walmart for a fraction of this price.</li>
    <li> I have used the product twice and I love the way may hair feels after using the product: my hair is soft and manageable. After only two uses I noticed that my hair is not falling out as much. I am grateful for that. I also use it on my feet I know it is for hair but I love the way it softens my feet. I will definitely reorder this product and highly recommend it. Excellent customer service. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> love it gave one to friend she loved it</li>
    <li> I recieved this yesterday and tried it on my naturally wavy, frizzy hair. It was great, it did what it said. I got up this worming and styled my hair with it, all I can say is FINALLY a product that did what it says it does. Soft , silky and easy to style... Thank you Thank you......</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 10+ stars. This is the best product I have ever bought. It substitutes my leave in, gel, mousse, ect. Now I wash my hair put this on and let my hair air dry, and the smell is outstanding...Amazing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My  hair looks absolutely amazing!!! I mean as I walk it looks healthy, it shine is everything a beauty parlor would wanting  and more</li>
    <li> Clearly this company is using fake reviews&lt;br /&gt;to highlight their &amp;#34;5-star&amp;#34; good-for-nothing hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair product does nothing. It makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;slightly oily for 1 minute then it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s original state.&lt;br /&gt;If anything it makes it frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could pour the entire bottle on my head and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll just dry up and still remain the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, REAL argan oil makes your hair really oily and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;This.. I don&#x27;t even know what this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+1 star for the attractive packaging. Other than that,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great oil and a great value. Works great in combo with the cream.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, shiny, smelling good. Have short, above shoulder-length hair, and I use about 3-4 squirts after shower and/or while drying.</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or greasy feeling after I apply it to my damp or dry hair. It is very lightweight and it claims to have heat protecting abilities which is a plus. I especially like to add it after I style my hair and it tames my flyways and gives a nice shine. It is good for me because I don&#x27;t like to put too much product in my hair!</li>
    <li> Great oil, this oil help my dry hair so well, use it on mt face also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it does its job, makes my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and feels so good too! I love it! I used it at least once a week. I will be back for more for sure. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is no longer straw but soft and looking healthy looking. Great customer service</li>
    <li> I use it around one month and it works! My damaged hair seems healthier and it is softer to touch.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, and I have tried so many. Hydrates my hair and leaves a softness. No greasy residue. Hands feel soft afterwards, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair and this is a terrific product to keep the ends hydrated.</li>
    <li> This was an okay oil treatment.  It did detangle my hair which was very surprising, but as far as shine and softness, I did not notice a difference.  I ordered the entire line because I love using systems but the line doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe they are not for African-Americans after all.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful leave in condition oil.  It works on my dry hair,&lt;br /&gt;  makes my hair feel  light and soft.  No sticky residue.  Love the smell,&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tried many products, none compare to getting the job done as this one does.&lt;br /&gt; Also, I received my shipment very quick. The price is really great and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I am from middle east and I have rather thick hair. I have used a variety of products to control frizz. Arvazallia has been my best experience! It smells good and is light compared to other products.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to out to write a review for something unless I truly feel strongly about it positively or negatively.  I just received this hair oil and I had to write about it so others can possibly experience the same thing I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil when I first received it, on dry hair, and it gave me the most beautiful sheen without weighing my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I used it as recommended. I washed my hair and applied it to damp hair and proceeded to blow dry and flat iron my hair.  I haven&#x27;t seen my hair look this good in a long time. Lots of body and shine and so healthy looking.  I received compliments all day the next day.  It seemed this oil even brought out the highlights in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve never had an oil that&#x27;s worked this well with my hair.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to others and hope Arvazallia is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> Loved this product, it calmed the freez in my hair in just one use gave it amazing shine, will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ! Makes my hair so soft and healthy. My hair is so beautiful!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, which is very important to me, when I use any type of hair product! I have used one n only Argan Oil before, smell very nice.  I think this is the same product, just different name! I will update once I used it!  Update on &amp;#34;ARVAZALLIA&amp;#34; I color my hair platinum blonde. As I mentioned, Previously used one n only Argan, not Arvazallia, I decided to order it, since it is part of Argan Oil hair product, which I love love love.  I used organic hair color product, to avoid chemically produced  hair color, I could not get the color I want!  Because of that, to have platinum blonde,  I have to use chemically produced color.. that is the fact! At the same time token, I want to make sure, my colored hair is treated the best product available in the market, to avoid color hair dry scalp and overall conditions!  I am sure, we all used different hair product, some stinks at the same time cheap price, some expensive at the same time does not deliver the result we want, which is &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL HEALTHY HAIR&amp;#34; My conclusion, &amp;#34;ARVAZALLIA GIVES YOU BEAUTIFUL HEALTHY HAIR&amp;#34; In addition I love the smell of it! &amp;#34; It will be nice if they have a deal like.. buy two get one free or buy one the second half off...I will look for that type of deal on this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year ago and I can only say is the best hair oil treatment.</li>
    <li> First, let me start off by saying I rarely write reviews. But this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this product: I am 20 years old. My hair has never been dyed/colored/chemically treated. I would describe my hair as regular-to-fine strands with not super thick hair. My hair will pretty much do anything I want it to as far as straightening with an iron (stays straight on less humid days--I live in Florida) and curling with an iron (stays with no hairspray). When I was younger I had fairly straight hair but it curled right up when I hit puberty. I never knew what to do with it in middle school so I fried the crap out of it. It took me until high school to embrace the wavy-curly that my hair had become. My hair has always been pretty soft especially when I straighten it--definitely not coarse hair. In college I started taking care of my hair and skin a lot more but still used heat tools occasionally for events and special occasions. It had become this curly-at-the-top-straight-at-the-bottom ordeal and I was not so thrilled. I&#x27;m terrible at blowing out my hair with a brush so that it would all be smooth so I would usually end up with a weird wave in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR NOW: I found this product watching a hair tutorial on YouTube by MakeupWearables. She raved about it but my hair is nothing like hers. I decided to try it anyways and bought both the Oil treatment and the deep conditioner. OH. MY. GOSH. I have been using them for about a month or so now and this is probably one of my favorite beauty products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They both smell amazing... kind of like a salon. They both make your hair super soft, really manageable, and my favorite part was that they kind of straightened out the waves I was having problems with. Now I use 4 pumps of the Argan oil (chest/breast-length hair) and finger comb it through my hair before blowdrying. It speeds up drying time, protects the hair, and prevents my hair from being a wavy mess like every other time. I would HIGHLY recommend this to everyone and anyone.. I would HIGHLY recommend this to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and this product world perfectly.</li>
    <li> After I had my hair turned platinum blonde, it was quite stiff and dried out. I had done some reading on how important a hair care regimen is post-bleaching to restore life to hair, and I knew I needed a serum. I had read conflicting things about silicon serum, so I didn&#x27;t want to go that route. I&#x27;m not the type that is huge on natural or organic solutions (after all, poison ivy is natural so not everything natural is automatically good), but this seemed like a great alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some months of aggressive conditioning and daily applications of running this serum through my hair, but now I hardly need it anymore! It works great. It&#x27;s given shine and moisture back to my hair and smoothed it out without making it oily. Also, it smells nice, which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has been a great purchase. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It&#x27;s one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. It keeps my hair soft and smooth. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands but this is the one I like best.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. My order was here within 3 days. It smells great, and makes my hair shine. No oily residue.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I am trying to grow out layers in my collarbone length hair.  While I have gotten regular trims on the bottom, I haven&#x27;t had my layers trimmed in over 9 months.  They looked so unhealthy that I was about to chop 3 inches off my hair just to get rid of the bottom layer.  After reading the reviews on this product (found it on Pinterest), I decided to give it a try before getting my hair cut.  So, I received it today, did the leave in treatment for 30 minutes, washed my hair, then applied a tiny amount to the ends after towel drying.  Holy cow, I cannot stop looking at my hair!  It looks shiny, soft and healthy....and no more straw!  Love this product and highly recommend!  Will be stocking up on this stuff :).</li>
    <li> At last i got what i was expecting of a leave on... This is awesome.. I have my hair till waist and very waivy bush !! This product tames it like charm!!! Thank you !!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased I found the Arvazallia products which leave the hair silky soft. This product is highly recommended. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products to help manage my curly, frizzy hair, and this product smells great and does seem to help make it softer and more manageable.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wow!! My hair is in much better shape after using this product just one time! My hair is frizzy and this just made it so smooth and manageable.... Definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing....I&#x27;ve been using since I first got it and my hair feels so healthy, soft, silky and looks way better than before. I&#x27;ve tried countless products to help me repair the damage to my hair and this is the only product that&#x27;s has been consistent and it also doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp</li>
    <li> Love this product...makes my hair feel so clean and smooth...contains the frizzies and flyaways..</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable.......everything is true about it and more. It has a soft pleasing fragrance and my thick - dry hair has never responded to a product as well as it does this one. Transformed my hair into shiny healthy hair in two applications.....seriously!! I will buy again and I use every day now. I love it. Thank you for this great product!! A+++</li>
    <li> This oil smells amazing and works well when used with the argan oil hair mask for a very deep conditioner.  The bottle looks very high end but is prone to spilling so make sure the bottle is always upright!  Finally, the customer service I received from the vendor was superb!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have natural hair. My hair gets freeze but this product makes it soft, shiny, and healthy looking. I also have thin hair and this product does not make it greasy. A little goes a long way. Luv it n I do recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I took the suggestion from other review and bought the hydrating mask which it&#x27;s a great product too&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service by the way.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  one word sums up this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer and hair strengthener</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand of Moroccan argan oil for at least 2 years, and it was &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but would leave a residue on my hands, and if I happened to use a little bit too much it made my hair noticeably oily. However, this Argan oil is PHENOMENAL! High quality, light weight and for my long, decently thick hair, I only use 2 pumps of it all over my hair after I get out of the shower and it works wonders. Combined with the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask, my hair feels 200% better. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!! It completely &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; my hair!!! I used it in damp clean hair and after styling too, truly amazing! Big bottle too for that price, I will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> Only had this stuff for a few days but I have already noticed a difference! I just finished my bottle of very expensive morrocan oil and was looking for a cheaper alternative !  I can say that so far this stuff makes my hair feel 100% softer . Will not be purchasing the pricy stuff ever again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I massage it into my scalp and through my thick hair.  It smells marvelous and my hair has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itch terribly, I don&#x27;t recommend this at all</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer and seals hair perfectly.  Really good for summer.  Wish it came in a spray form too.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this!  Very disappointed.  It smells SO good, but doesn&#x27;t work.  I have frizzy, curly hair, mid-back length hair and the first time I used it, I only put around four pumps in my hair because I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it.  Over the last few days I have worked up to 12 pumps.  Still there&#x27;s no change.  Lots of frizz.  Will go back to using Paul Mitchell Super skinny serum, which works quite well.  Might try this on my skin, as I saw some other reviewers have done.  I wish they could just bottle the smell!  Make a perfume, please!    ******UPDATE: I found a perfume that smells just like this oil!!  Revlon Fire &amp; Ice :D ******</li>
    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;Smell so good</li>
    <li> A bit too greasy for my white girl hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good product I switched from cocnut oil to this on my hair its not greasy either!</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a nice sheen and takes out the frizz. I wish I would have bought two bottles!!</li>
    <li> The product made my hair feel silky..loved it!..great product I would use again..,.you too would love the silky texture as you run your fingers through your hair...I would recommend enjoy!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It definitely helps the texture of my hair---an absolutely necessary item for those with coarse or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair care product. Invigorates and restores dull dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it feels on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product was so so.  It did not work as well as my other oil.  Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Great oil! Smells really good! Gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s kinda heavy and it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair oiled for more then 48 hrs. I have to use it every other day which is kinda dreadful since the oil is so heavy and weighs my hair down!</li>
    <li> The oil is very good and has a nice smell.  It&#x27;s a lot of oil for the price.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Love love this oil! It&#x27;s light but yet potent. I use it to seal before styling and then again once hair is dry to break the slight cast, no greasiness left behind. The smell is amazing And i love the packaging, very easy to pump out desired amount.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as much as the deep conditioning product. It has a musky smell that is a little too strong for me to it but it works well.</li>
    <li> Exceptional product! I have had issues with my hair being severely dry for a couple of years now.... No products seemed to work. This product has finally given me my soft hair again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not as I expected. still when I put it I have a frizzy hair</li>
    <li> It smells really good and makes your hair really soft.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil I only need to use 1 or two pumps and it seals my end well</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I use it on my thick coarse hair and on my daughter&#x27;s fine thin hair.  We have soft shining hair now that never looks oily.</li>
    <li> Love it! After few weeks of using Arvazallia Argan Oil my hair were so smooth and looks healthy...</li>
    <li> I bought this for 18.99.  I love how the bottle is made of glass. Best hair oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, I figured with such positive responses I would have the same to deliver but I was wrong.  Let me start by saying my hair is the typical highlighted, straightened type of hair that is natural curly with an unmanagable amount of frizz to it on humid days.  I tried this treatment several ways just in case I was using it wrong... I tried it as a leave in conditioner after towel drying, left it fuzzy.  I tried it as a leave in conditioner without ANY drying, still left it fuzzy.  I tried it as a protector AFTER my hair was dry and before I straightened it, left it fluffy and fuzzy sorta like the south end of a north bound Poodle.  So... needless to say, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Yes, it does smell ok, yes it feels silky in your hands and yes I had high hopes it would work but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I have a tight curl pattern, and enjoy flat ironing as well as wearing my hair natural. These were the results after using the serum on my curly hair https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5s7qmHOIdYs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the results on my straightened hair : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;TQUTP5V4rX4</li>
    <li> This oil is great for your hair. It is not oily as one would think. It has a great smell and makes your hair look and feel healthy. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with this product. I have thick Asian hair, 2 pumps when hair is half dry, shine and soft and smells very nice. The bottle can last long time, money is well spend.</li>
    <li> it works and is excellent. The reason I purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of oils.  I like trying them to find out which ones I like so I&#x27;ve gone through at least 7-8 different brands. From pure tea tree oil (works wonders for an itchy scalp if you can get over the terrible smell. Mixes well with peppermint) to what you can find in your local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair.  I straighten on a relatively normal basis.  I use a heat protector and oil.  For the most part, that&#x27;s it unless I need a pomade.  I use the liquid pomade from Carol&#x27;s Daughter and the Silk Elements heat protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because of the great reviews but I was a little disappointed after using it.  What does it do?  To start, it has a silicone feel to it.  I didn&#x27;t really look to see if it has silicone in it, but it was definitely more slick then most oils I&#x27;ve used.  The one thing I did love about it was the smell.  That&#x27;s really about it.  I didn&#x27;t feel as if it improved my hair in any way nor did it ruin my hair which is why I rated it in the center. I&#x27;ll stick with my coconut oil for now.  So far, it&#x27;s my oil of choice. I won&#x27;t be buying this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. My hair has never felt this soft:)</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because my scalp was dry and itchy due to hard water.  I no longer have the problem.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It has a lovely fragrance. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product! Makes you hair moisturized, shiney, not greasy at all, and smells amazing! The smell reminds me of VS True Romance. I can put this product in my hair damp or dry and it still makes my hair silky soft and shiney. I have corse, wavy, thick hair and flat iron it basically everyday and this product has made my hair feel amazing. It comes in a decent sized bottle and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so this bottle will last me a very long time. Definitely worth the price!! I&#x27;m very satisfied and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> best argan oil love it</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair!!! Definitely buying again..:)</li>
