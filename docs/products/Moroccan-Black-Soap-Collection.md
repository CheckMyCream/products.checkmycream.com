<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the Moroccan Black Soap with Argan Oil for my wife. This is exactly what she said &amp;#34;the black soap smoothed my skin,removed the dead skin from my body, and I especially loved it when I am using it with Kae Exfoliating Hammam Glove.&amp;#34; Would definitely buy again for her.</li>
    <li> I love the Black Soap, makes my skin feel so good . I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Hard to use because it&#x27;s in a kind of thick, Slippery clump. It drops on the shower floor and makes it slick. So slippery it&#x27;s hard to use so I only used it once.  It&#x27;s probably very nice but not user-friendly.</li>
    <li> I am not in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel nice and it takes some time to dissolve  in water.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a strange smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, so this may be better for someone with oilier skin.</li>
    <li> This soap leaves my skin feeling so nice. Try it with a hammam mitt. Let this soap sit on your skin about 5 minutes, rinse, then rub your skin down with the hammam glove and it&#x27;s amazing (and gross) how much dead skin, dirt, and oil you will SEE being removed.&lt;br /&gt;This container could almost be smaller, a little goes such a long way.</li>
    <li> Living in the northeast this winter has been quite a nightmare especially on my skin which has been very dry. I stumbled across this product and purchased it with the exfoliating glove and use about once every other week. It is so soothing and makes my skin feel baby soft especially the back of my arms and elbows. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Softest smoothest skin I have had in years. Has not alleviated some of my minor back acne but does wonders for the rest of me. I&#x27;m really happy I found this product. Make sure to use an exfoliating glove!</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for bringing these amazing items into my life. I am hooked on Japanese products Korean products and now this wonderful Moroccan black soap. I used this with my clarisonic and got amazing results. I have to say though the smell is not so great but there are 4 ingredients in this and no fragrance sooo I love that. I have acne prone skin. I spent most of my life in the sun. I surf and lived in Florida so my skin was pretty damaged. Now I reversed the damage and now this is a staple in my anti aging acne prone skin regime. How did I ever live without this?? I used this on my face knees and elbows and omg just pure silky softness. I just received this yesterday and am sooo happy. I am achieving the skin I always dreamed about. I also notice a little bit goes a long long way. I got the Argan oil one. I use Argan oil in my hair or coconut oil. Depends on the day :-)  Now Argan oil on my face too. I love it!! I got a beautiful pinky glow after using this and it stayed that way today. Also the few blemishes I had are gone :-) You have to try this. Yes it smells and looks like tar but what matters is what it does. I give myself glycolic and acid peels. This is a wonderful product to use in between for that fresh glow. All natural paraben free and not tested on animals just another plus. No wonder Moroccan women have such beautiful skin. They use this!!  I am done with American products unless they are formulated by recipes by other countries. I had a mild breakout from using coconut oil on my face. I am one of the rare people that coconut oil made me breakout:( this cleared it right up. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will be purchasing again and again. Also now that I fixed my face I will always wear sunblock and spray tan ONLY!!  I highly recommend this to everyone. Dont be put off by the smell!! Well time to roller derm put on my Japanese collagen mask and be plumped up for the weekend :-)</li>
    <li> Okay. The smell is awful, and it leaves my skin feeling somewhat tight.</li>
    <li> This soap has a natural, earthy small.  I used it at the hammam in Mauritania but never knew what it was called.  Upon trying it stateside, I realized it was nearly identical.  This is a very high-quality product that will leave your skin incredibly soft and smooth.I have very fair, sensitive skin but can even use it on my face.  The service from Zakia&#x27;s was prompt and courteous.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. I have very dry skin and this helps to keep it moisturized. I&#x27;m really pleased with the product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The Moroccan Black Soap Lavender with Argan oil is indeed a much superior cleansing product than any that I&#x27;ve used before.  I find its medicinal and moisturizing properties outstanding and I&#x27;d readily recommend this product to anyone and everyone.  Great service as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my girlfriend at the time, after a recommendation from a lady who seemed to actually know what she was talking about. My girlfriend really loved this product and was curious &amp; suspicious as to how would I possibly know about such a specific and quality hair product? Seeing as this was her first introduction to this product and she&#x27;s a so-called hair expert....    Long story short, we&#x27;re no longer together. But hey, you win some &amp; lose some....no regrets in that department though. We&#x27;re still cool.</li>
    <li> Zakia’s Morocco, Moroccan Black Soap with Argan Oil-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the jar and it’s a dark colored solution that is more a very dark brown but the hue is maybe 2 shades lighter before black. Not the hue you associate with soap and then I thought about charcoal and again I was wrong! I open the jar and the scent is earthy but not unpleasant. I then realize after reading that the product is made with an olive pulp that is sometimes called “olive pumice”. The pulp is classified as a by-product, meaning it’s the left-over from production and on most times it’s olive oil. Now, the color makes sense! When you produce olive oil, the pulp left is about 50 to 70 percent and some manufactures will then produce a lesser quality oil on the second press or find a second use elsewhere. The olive pulp is rich in antioxidants and nutrients (lipids, oleic acid to Vitamin E), so it’s not in any way just trying to find a use for left-overs. These left-overs will not only feed your skin but are gentle enough to be used for all skin types. I can see why the pulp is used and makes for a great emollient and for exfoliating applications. Zakia’s Morocco then takes this rich ingredient and adds Argan oil and a little salt and it’s really simply created but beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I used the soap two times a week for a period of 3.5 weeks. It’s gentle and feels good on the skin once you add a little bit of water and you work the lather up between your hands, before applying it to your skin. The Moroccan Black Soap by Zakia’s Morocco can be applied to your face and body, so great for the back and chest area. The soap did not ever over dry or cause patchy areas, it remains gentle but effective because my skin was soft and clean. My feet start getting dry being in sandals during warmer weather and the pool’s chlorine water tends to exasperate it but once I started using the soap on my feet, it not only felt nice but left my skin soft and helped it retain moisture. Even my nail’s cuticle improved. You use small amounts and it’s really a nicer soap for your skin that enriches it but also cleanses it. I received the above product(s) free of charge from Zakia’s Morocco.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.nail’s cuticle improved.

    <li> Too small. (Cheating) The pic is decieving. I haven&#x27;t noticed changes yet like how i used to notice using another morrocan soap product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and she was absolutely ecstatic with it. She loves the scent and the feeling of her skin after using the product.It takes her back to our trip to Morocco last year. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the product and it&#x27;s after effect, body feels silky after use, it has this glowing effect too. No reactions to the body</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It leaves your skin soft and feeling great.  I have never exfoliated my face before and was a little cautious about it. However, this product made it easy.  I will buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Let me start off saying that it&#x27;s nice to read glowing reviews about a product, then to try it and have the same positive results. My legs have always been dry compared to other parts of my body, and prone to roughness without diligent and consistent care. I happened upon Gold Bond Rough and Bumpy skin cream and was disappointed that after two weeks I noticed no improvement in my skin. After my first use of Zakia&#x27;s black soap, I felt the difference in my skin, but after the second use, I was definitely sold. The softness and smoothness are incredible. This is a product that can be effective on the face and body. For an extra measure of smoothness, I also use an exfoliating lotion, which may seem like overkill, but my skin can take it. I also use a nice moisturizing lotion later in the evening for extra softness. Will definitely keep this product in my skin care arsenal.</li>
    <li> Very nice, would repurchase.</li>
    <li> My wife is Moroccon and she swears that this is exactly what they use in Morocco and now she is in love of this product! Argan oil is awesome and is only found in specific areas of Morocco and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it. You are paying a US price for this product, but at least its a very nice product and is easily available to US customers.</li>
    <li> It is amazing For the first time in my life my skin become very silky and no more checkin skin (skin condition )</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this - but I love it.  It takes a little time to get the hang of it, but once you do you will be pleased.  I&#x27;m just using on my face right now - and I think it will last forever.  The trick is that you don&#x27;t need much.  Make sure your face is damp and rub into a lather into wet hands first.</li>
    <li> So happy that I purchased this product.  Face feels soft and clean.  Wish that I would of learned of this years ago.  Great product especially for the cost</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel cleaner and clearer and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Its really good, however, it dries your skin out when you wash your face with it. But the after result is amazing. :-)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Skin feels so good after using.  Really helps winter dry skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap! I can&#x27;t believe how squeaky clean it gets my skin, but not only that it leaves it very moisturized and soft as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it the last time alongside my exfoliating glove, scrubbing while the soap was still on my skin and it was even more effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I came across a random review about this magical stuff. I had never even heard of it but when another viewer was talking about effective ways to make self tanner go on rough skin patches smoothly and mentioned Moroccan black soap, I had to check it out. I saw all the great reviews on this brand and got it. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s in my top 10 beauty favs now</li>
    <li> I love this product! It left my skin softer than it has ever been. It was like having a mini spa day at home! I would recommend this to everyone looking to add that something extra to their routine. I used this with an exfoliating glove and it was the perfect combination.</li>
    <li> Great product. Skin is silky smooth!!!</li>
    <li> The soap is a gross consistency and color. It reminds me of the tar that sometime ends up on your feet in the ocean! It doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant, nor does it smell bad.....but you are not using this for the way IT looks- it&#x27;s about how it makes YOU look! Since I received this I have only used it twice. It&#x27;s amazing, in three days my skin looks better. I am using the argan oil as well. The soap is leaving my face feeling ultra clean, and moist. I have normal to dry, sun exposed skin. I&#x27;m feeling like I wish I would have discovered this ten years ago. I think if you had to have it smelling fresh like some soaps, you could add an essential oil, like eucalyptus or citrus. I like my perfume or body lotion to have the scent, not my face products. I would definitely recommend this product, in combo with the oil. (Just got the MIT )</li>
    <li> Great product, &amp; was received quickly.  Purchased this soap &amp; another with orange oil.  Makes my skin feel wonderful.  So glad there is a vendor who is able to provide these products, &amp; I would purchase the soap again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is one of those treatments everyone should have! By far my favorite facial soaps because your face really feels clean after one use. My face takes a week or so to adjust but once it did it cleared my skin up. I&#x27;ve gone through many black soaps that worked well but they usually left my skin dry. With this product, my skin feels moisturized and clean. The scent is one you may have to get used to, it&#x27;s different. It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, just the scent of argan oil. The soap runs thick but if you wash as instructed, it loosens immediately with the warm water. Zakia&#x27;s Morocc does so well with their products I can&#x27;t see myself not buying again. My skin thanks me every day for taking a chance on such a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 3 weeks and using it on my acne prone very sensitive face has been a blessing. Although I didn&#x27;t see the dead skin falling off my face like some reviews mentioned, I can absolutely testify of softer smoother skin and less blackheads (probably 70% less blackheads so far).&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the mitten and it helps but I&#x27;ll leave the mitten review for the mitten :)&lt;br /&gt;I only gave a 4 star because it took me a while to know how to apply the soap which has a very thick consistency and foams just little. Found out it&#x27;s easier to apply on dampened skin with wet hands. I thought that should have been written on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I had ever used honestly. I wish I knew there is such a thing that existed since I was younger.</li>
    <li> I chose this soap after reading some other reviews and I can only agree!  This stuff is wonderful.  My skin feels so soft and silky after using it.  If you are looking for a soap that will make your skin feel amazing, this is the stuff for you!  I was surprised at the thickness and lack of lather but I quickly got used to it - after all it&#x27;s strange chemicals that make soap lather up!  I could not ask for more in a product and will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> If you make sure you use it properly, it&#x27;s one of the most amazing products for your skin!!!!! Forget about the body washes with exfoliating beads and other gimmicky products of that sort. All you need is a kessa glove and this black soap. I could not believe how smooth my skin was, after the very first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Stand under the shower for a minute or two, setting the water temperature to as hot as I can stand (I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s around 85-90 degrees).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Step aside and set the water temperature to the hottest possible setting. The bathroom starts steaming up at this point.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I let the steam moisten my skin, while being careful not to touch the super hot water.&lt;br /&gt;4.  After about 5 minutes, I bring the water temperature back to &amp;#34;bearably hot&amp;#34; and start applying the black soap all over. All I can smell is fresh olives and nothing else. It&#x27;s a really nice smell, if you&#x27;re not a big fan of totally artificial chemically induced fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Once I&#x27;m done applying the black soap, I let it stay for about 5-10 more minutes.&lt;br /&gt;6.  I rinse the kessa glove and gently rub it on my skin in vertical (up/down) movements, spending more time on areas such as my knees, elbows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Rinse it off, while still rubbing with the kessa glove one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. I can&#x27;t believe how it gets rid of all the tiny red bumps or any other spots on my skin and leave it unbelievably smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is really great, if it wasn&#x27;t that expensive I would use it a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, but you need to buy an exfoliating mitt or glove to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin feels really soft and hydrated after use. This product is great for people with dry skin or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used it to wash my hair. It is not easy to wash your hair with this product, but after use, my hair felt so much thicker and was easy to comb. My hair felt hydrated, a bit greasy, but not greasy (hard to explain the feeling), but didn&#x27;t look greasy at all. My hair looked just more beautiful and healthy. (I have really fine, straight hair)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! If you manipulate it a few seconds, it also gets quite foamy.</li>
    <li> I was not a lover of this product on my first try but within three applications I could see my skin changing for the better. I am suffering from a skin problem and I want any and all help that I could get to help resolve my skin problem. Application one was ok but I did notice that my skin felt clean, not sticky but a little dull then on application two I saw the spot look lighter or different in many ways as I applied my medications I saw the skin looking brighter in the skin then I noticed that I could clear spot in the skin coloring and now the coloring is lighter and clear. All I can say “Thank you” for introducing this product to me and letting me know that black soap along with the Argan Oil can really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zakia’s Morocco gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> This is messy to use, but I do like how it makes my skin feel.  Will buy more when this gone.</li>
    <li> This product might soften skin, but it smells like motor oil.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I used such a soft-type soap and I really love it! It really CLEANS my face but keeps moisture after the use. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> i really enjoy the texture, smell and feel of it on my skin. perhaps a bigger bottle would be worth making.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel great!</li>
    <li> It takes a little time to get used to the consistency but once you do you will never use anything else!!! The directions say to apply and leave on for ten minutes but I don&#x27;t always have time for that and I am still seeing great results. The price seemed a little steep at first but it is totally worth it.  One jar will last for quite awhile and I don&#x27;t need to buy lotion near as much as I used to.  I was hesitant to use it on my face at first but I 100% recommend it. I also recommed getting an exfoliating mitt to multiply the results.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all natural, however, my experience with the product is that it isn&#x27;t as hydrating/moisturizing as I read in the reviews. I have used other products that were all natural, and not as pricey, which is why I&#x27;m given the product a 3 star review.</li>
    <li> Never used black soap before, but I am hooked.  Love the way my skin feels after shower and how my face feels after washing with this.  Exceptional!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking many years to find black moroccan soap that she used growing up in France. She was delighted by this product. She says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful product: it smells good and the texture very smooth. The color is a little odd if you&#x27;re using it for the first time but it is not a big problem because after using it your skin is clean, moist and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;If you wax your legs, it&#x27;s the fantastic product to prepare your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt foam, smells bad and..... Hunnn</li>
    <li> The product is all what it says and a bit more. The only problem is that i received it with 6 months to expiry makes it difficult to purchase in large amounts</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin clean and I&#x27;ve noticed the result from first time use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a weird texture and smell but when I use it with the glove my skin feels really soft.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works or not</li>
    <li> Ick. It smells so bad I don&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
    <li> I guess I liked it so well I already gone through the entire container.  I only received it around Christmas time as a treat for myself.  Needless to say it made my skin feel nourished and pampered.  Would I order this again?  Absolutely!  One of my favorite &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; treatments to give to myself in my hurried world.</li>
    <li> This soap with Argan Oil is the path to heavenly, smooth skin, I&#x27;ve recently discovered.  Works well with the Chaacoca Moroccan exfoliating mitt.  Bought both; I use once or twice in 10 days - a miracle!  Baby-soft skin is now here!  Great for pre-treatment when self-tanning.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I guess.  Can be a little drying.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about a loose type of soap in a jar.  I have a tendency to take a glop of it then put it on my washcloth...maybe that&#x27;s why I am a little dry &#x27; cause I using too much perhaps?</li>
    <li> I have been to a real Moroccan bath once in Middle East. And ever since, I wanted to try it myself at home. I bought this soap and went straight to my gym to soak in the steam room. I tried it both- in the steam room and in the shower at home-  both worked. My skin was super soft!</li>
    <li> I use this as a shampoo.  I feel like this soap is good for me.  I even shave with this soap. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> This creamy black soap is wonderful and rich. It makes my skin so soft.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel really clean. Prepared well for lotions.</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Black soap is the best.  It is so good at exfoliating that you have to be careful if you are using the recommended exfoliating mitten. You could take some skin off.  I had a small wound on my arm that was healing with a scab.  I had no idea that this product would melt the scab.  It did,  It&#x27;s not a negative for me because the  wound healed without a scar in just a few days. I also have a small area on my arm that diagnosed as folliculitis that I have been battling for more than 3 years.  My doctor prescribed creams, gels, foams, clindamycin...nothing worked.  I have even had a biopsy...diagnosis, folliculitis... but after using Zakias, the area has healed, and I mean in as short as 5 days. I must also say that in general, my skin loves this product, blackheads...gone and I no longer need to use a lotion.  My skin glows on its own and is really, really soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m just too happy.</li>
    <li> I simply love this black soap. It&#x27;s very efficient yet moisturizing and I will definitely buy it again. I wasn&#x27;t so sure it would work but it did and I&#x27;m glad. My skin is now bright and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I followed the instructions and left on for 10 minutes. I rinsed and exfoliated with a Hamman glove afterwards. My skin felt soft, smooth, and squeaky clean. The best part was that when I exited the shower my skin was not dry. I have dry sensitive African American skin and this product did not irritate or dry my skin out. I will use forever. Thanks Zakia&#x27;s for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> BEWARE: has Potassium Hydroxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check for yourself what this stuff is or,&lt;br /&gt;Pasted from official source:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Hydroxide&lt;br /&gt;is on the Right to Know Hazardous&lt;br /&gt;Substance List because it is cited by ACGIH, DOT, NIOSH,&lt;br /&gt;NFPA and EPA.&lt;br /&gt;f&lt;br /&gt;This chemical is on the Special Health Hazard Substance&lt;br /&gt;List.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap along with the exfoliating glove, and from the first use I was in love with it.  It leaves my winter dry skin feeling soft and smooth without that &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling.  It is definitely a product that I will continue to purchase and have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I really love using the Moroccan Black Soap w/ Argan oil in combination with the Kessa Exfoliating Glove. My skin is so soft afterward. The moisturizer oil I use afterward seems to absorb better and last longer as well. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Takes just a little to rather up thick and rich. Leaves skin clean and very soft</li>
    <li> Use 2-3 times a week. Really cleanses and exfoliates my skin well.</li>
    <li> Its awesome product, and i will buy it every month. My skin get better and better.</li>
    <li> This moroccan soap is perfect. it is similar to what I have tried in moroccan bath. I recommend it to those who like to revitalize their skin.</li>
    <li> I started waxing everything below the waist two years ago roughly and at first everything looked pristine and flawless and then for some reason I started getting not just ugly but painful ingrown hairs along my bikini area. I was very discouraged and holy hell I could feel the bumps through my pants when I moved around that&#x27;s how painful and big they were.  In an effort to avoid having to buy expensive in grown hair serums, I researched day after day what I could do to eliminate this new problem and I kept reading the words &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; over and over. Well don&#x27;t i already exfoliate enough!? I thought to myself thinking of my shower supplies... I came across the kae exfoliate mit and then this black soap after looking for more exfoliant tools to add to my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen so much dead skin roll off my body . Ever. Really let your body humidify before applying the soap. For example do your hair and face before starting on your body. Then turn the shower off and you&#x27;ll see that a little goes a long way. Take time to really lather and massage the soap all over your body, I focus more on my lower half.  Now when your ready to start scrubbing carefully turn the water back on without getting the soap rinsed off (remember you need to scrub while the soap is on) and scrap in linear directions all over.  You&#x27;ll feel it you&#x27;ll see it , I was amazed with how much dead skin was on me. It&#x27;s quite fascinating to see it all and kind of gross.&lt;br /&gt;You must follow up with a serious body oil after this... I use Emu oil which is sold on amazon and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment has TREMENDOUSLY reduced my ingrowns and my skin is glowing at a level I didn&#x27;t know it could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really in love with this stuff and if you are considering it, do it and be amazed at how clean you feel after. you will be wishing you would have known about it sooner like me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference. Letting it sit all over your skin while your in the shower waiting 15 min. before water can touch itis a drag.</li>
    <li> My skin is clear and moisturized. Great for sensitive skin too. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product--wish I had discovered this sooner! The soap is super creamy with a very wonderful, but subtle, scent. Only a small amount is necessary so I envision this jar lasting me awhile. I used this in conjunction with the exfoliating glove and my skin has never felt so soft.</li>
    <li> Having to leave this on for 10 minutes in the middle of a shower is really inconvenient. It has a weird smell and tarlike texture. I didn&#x27;t hate it but don&#x27;t want to use it again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. ( Moroccan black soap with argan oil) This is the first product of its type I have used. I also purchased the Kae exfoliating hammam glove. I have recently acknowledged my skin as a major organ of my body and figure a good cleaning is worth while. I must say, after a good scrubbing with these two products, My skin feels clean &amp; rejuvenated. I plan to incorporate this into part of a better health &amp; hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week with the exfoliating mit (bought sepperately) an I must say that I believe it is the soap that makes the mit work. I have used the Kassas with regular body wash and was never as soft as when I use the black soap. Trick is, you have to follow the directions. Here&#x27;s what I do: take a plain old bath, no oils, just to soften up your skin. Then drain the tub. Open up the jar and appy it everywhere and spend about 8 minutes rubbing it around... Then take the kassas Mit and from neck and shoulders work your way down, paying attention to the neglected areas, knees, butt, elbows and armpits. Down the legs for some extra scrubb on the feet. Then rinse, using the mit to slough off the extra skin. Softest skin ever and I am the exfoliating queen!</li>
    <li> I am originally from Morocco and haven&#x27;t used this kind of soap in ages during a recent trip to Morocco I got to use it again and fell in love with it I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Zakia&#x27;s black soap is sooo amazing it is similar in consistency and quality to the moroccan soap I used back in Morocco. Also the packaging is very nice and lasts for a very long time will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> great quality, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> After this winter I needed some major exfoliation. This product really works. After sitting in a steamy tub, I applied the black soap in a circular motion and then allowed it to remain on my skin for about 10 minutes. Then I began exfoliation with a Hammam glove. My skin is now soft and it is able to absorb moisturizer much more effectively. The nasty flakes and winter dryness are history.</li>
    <li> In the last in the year and a half I have lost almost 200 pounds. I have a problem with my skin not going back to its perfect tightness.  This soap seems to help with that especially my problem areas.  This is my third jar and I&#x27;m going to be buying more. I have shared my secret with my other weight-loss friends. They all love it too.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with products that use harsh chemicals , drying out my skin and or getting a rash was way too common..I was debating on whether to give this a try...Well I&#x27;m so pleased I took the time to read reviews and go with my gut ..I paired this with a Hammam Mitt.  Seeing the flaking dead, skin was at first a bit shocking { the amount  that floated on the water  , I plugged the drain when I was ready for the exfoliating  part }  but the feel and look of my skin after was Amazing for my condition..I&#x27;m so pleased with this that I&#x27;m a true fan..Because I have environmental  health issues caused by some unknown allergies { I never know what will help or hurt until I try } it has become a expensive trial and error for me . When I find a true product of this caliber I &#x27;m overjoyed ..I&#x27;m truly a fan and will continue to buy..~!~</li>
    <li> I chose this soap after receiving a Moroccan exfoliating mitt and realizing it was best used with Moroccan soap. This product is thicker than I imagined it would be but is surprisingly easy to use. The combination of soap plus mitt gives soft, smooth skin which I didn&#x27;t think was possible in such a cold, dry winter!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;During a recent trip to Paris I experienced black soap for the first time, I was delighted to find it available online from this seller at a reasonable price. The product came quickly and am very happy with it…your skin will be silky smooth after one use. Love!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wow this moroccan black soap is incredible once you uses it your skin is like a baby smooth and clean I love to use m hammam glove for a perfect exfoliation.  I will keep using this soap.</li>
    <li> This is some great soap, it is so good in making skin feel super soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I will order again!!!!</li>
    <li> Moroccan Black Soap, a 100% natural cleanser made from plant products, has been used by Moroccan women centuries. It is packed with minerals and Vitamin E, which help to cleanse, exfoliate, and detoxify the skin. I like to use Moroccan Black Soap in the shower about twice a week. I wait until after I wash and condition my hair to use the soap, so that the warm water has opened up my pores, and my skin is nice and wet.  When I am ready to use the soap I add a bit to my exfoliating mitt and massage it into my entire body.  After I have covered my entire body I wait about a minute, then rinse it off. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and incredibly soft.  I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> This is a funny kind of paste that you have to sort of work into your skin.  Use small amounts.  You wonder at first how to use it exactly BUT stick with it because it works!</li>
    <li> Wooowww I love this soap&lt;br /&gt;The feel on the skin is marvelous&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up Zakias Morocco for such a good product&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing more of this is a must for me</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I am careful about the products I use. I love the way this soap leaves my skin feeling very clean yet not dry at all. I use it twice a week and it does a good job of exfoliation. I am actually seeing the texture of my skin improving. Definitely will recommend any one to try this product. Really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times since I have bought it. My husband who is Moroccan use to tell me how wonderful the Black Soap was, but I had not tried it before. Well, I LOVE IT!!!  My skin is so soft and youthful looking now. I absolutely love this soap and I will be a return customer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this site and the wonderful products you sell.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Soumia Merzouk</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it popped up when I searched &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34;. I already have African black soap, which is very different in texture, scent and results; I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to continue using it. I went ahead and bought the original scent Zakias in spite of other reviewers who expressed dissatisfaction with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I love the consistency, the scent is NOT offensive or unpleasant and it is the ONLY thing called &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that cleanses my oily but sensitive acne-prone skin without stripping it of all oils. It makes my skin feel clean but not with that &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; residue or that itchy, dry skin feeling- I was in a rush and forgot to put on lotion but didn&#x27;t miss it because my skin was not feeling uncomfortably dry. I really want to buy another jar of one of the other scents but I&#x27;m not even halfway finished this jar!! I will DEFINITELY buy this again.</li>
    <li> This soap cleans my skin softly and thoroughly. Ingredients are good and natural. It has a strong smell, but I like it.</li>
    <li> wonderful and amazing to use in the sauna!</li>
    <li> Excellent black soap. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A lovely product, and easy to use. I am over 50, and lotion does nothing to soften my skin. This product is luxurious. I use after exfoliating and do not use lotion for days afterwards. It is amazing how good I feel about my body just by softening my skin.</li>
    <li> groovy stuff I&#x27;ve never tried before. Don&#x27;t know why I bought it and not sure if Id buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality is amazing! Totally loved the product &amp; fast shipping.. Gonna try another prodocurs indeed soon.</li>
    <li> Great product and extremely fast service. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I  was not sure about  the  product . I love exfoliating  my body on a regular  basis  and  I  was  quite surprised  it made my skin incredibly  soft and tingling ,  rate this product  100% thank you</li>
    <li> I like this a lot....after one use, my skin felt soft, fresh and just goooood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though....don&#x27;t get this stuff in your eye....it&#x27;s hard to believe that a little soap speck to make you want to claw your eye out to relieve the pain!!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin (allergic to literally everything) and this soap doesn&#x27;t cause any weird reactions. I love it! And since I only have to use a tiny bit to get a good lather, I think this jar will last forever. :)</li>
    <li> Smells awful! Does not work on dry skin at all it actually made my skin feel sticky.</li>
    <li> I use it together with my hammam scrub, it&#x27;s not soapy like a regular soap.. it&#x27;s like a gel with very mild scent to it but gosh it does make the skin smooth after.. before after a hot shower my skin feels tight and dry but this soap with the hammam scrub my skin feels rejuvinated.  Great product!</li>
    <li> great service,product,price.thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked really well.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Thanks for prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Smooth soap, smells nice but not a strong scent so that&#x27;s good. I use it with an exfoliating glove a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, It makes my skin feel so soft like never before, I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Though it has a unique scent, it works wonders on exfoliating while adding moisture to my skin -- I glow after I&#x27;ve showered and I greatly appreciate this product! A LITTLE goes a very long way. I use in combination with a Super Hard exfoliator and my skin is supremely soft afterward; especially helps with those of use who occasionally suffer from psoriasis and dry skin...winter approaches fast, I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Immediately after trying a Hammam in Morocco, I went out looking for the best black soap.  It leaves your skin soft and moisturized, glowing and healthy.  Great for the hair, even as a preparation for shampooing, if you want healthy, shiny hair.  This is better than the soap I bought in Morocco, and has a pleasant fragrance.  Hightly recommended.</li>
    <li> Iam A male and my wife said my skin needed some help so she said try moroccan black soap I did and what difference it made to my skin .It made my skin heal and very smooth feel.I have no problem telling you men if you have any facial problems use this product you will see a big improvement. Thank you  Moroccan Black Soap</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product, I use a black soap bar on my face and I was hoping this would be a great travel friendly alternative to a bar. The product has kind of a funky smell...I have tried several different types of black soap even some purchased in Morocco and none of them smelled quite like this one. I would not purchase again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best product ever took off all the sead skin leaves thr skin soft and fresh</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought this product. However, when I sarted using this product I see dramatic changes to my skin. It made my skin so smooth and healthy. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I discovered this product! After one use, I could tell a difference in my skin. When I bought the Moroccan Black Soap, I was thinking of dry winter skin, but after using it, I can&#x27;t imagine being without it. This is a product that will be part of my skin care routine all year long. Twice a week I use an exfoliating glove with the soap - a truly &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; experience! Being able to create my own Hammam at home is a wonderful addition to my life and the perfect stress reliever. Thank you Zakia&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It exfoliates my skin very well and leaves it very soft. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Ive used black soap before and loved it, this  was like some sorta thick engine lubricant and smelled just like it..  was quick to (try) to  get it off my face as it repelled water ..  and it was burning.. don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a real product or a knock off ..  have to say very scary experience to use caution.</li>
    <li> Boy I have been trying to like this. Sorry....but this reminds me of bowel movement from a breastfed baby. It smells awful (kinda tarry?) and please try not to get any into your mouth. That being said, I have not used regularly and do not see anything different, so that is why I gave 3 stars because I don&#x27;t want to dog a product. I will use this up as I am a cheapskate, but maybe next time will use a black bar soap instead.I love trying different products and so this was def an experience. Due to the great reviews, I feel I am missing out on something. Please comment on this review if you have any advice for me besides keeping my mouth closed while bathing.</li>
