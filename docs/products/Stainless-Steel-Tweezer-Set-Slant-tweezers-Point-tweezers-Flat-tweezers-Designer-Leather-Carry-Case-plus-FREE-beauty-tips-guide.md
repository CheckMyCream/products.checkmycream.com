<li> It is a little pricy for my perspective(though</li>
<li> I have purchased several of them and all of them have broken.</li>
<li> Everything you need for regular maintenance and even tools to get those really difficult little hairs.  </li>
<li> The flat ones are blunt and useless</li>
<li> I go through tweezers like crazy in my house.</li>

    <li> Great set of tweezers.  Very high quality, look great and most importantly function flawlessly and come with a handy case for when I&#x27;m travelling.  Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This Tweezer set comes with 3 different tips, like it said on the title: Slant tip, Point tip, Flat tip tweezers plus FREE Leather Carry Case. I mainly want a tweezer for pulling out unwanted hair, and sometimes, need helps with my DIY project. It is a little pricy for my perspective(though I received discount for this product), but it is definitely a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I only used the straight tweezer and it was nice. I did however drop them which chipped the tip of the tweezer so I can no longer grab hair. They were nice then I had them though...</li>
    <li> These are very nice, precise tweezers.  Makes it easy to get even those baby fine hairs.</li>

    <li> Very good quality. This tweezer set has everything I needed. I didn&#x27;t know a pointed tweezer existed until I ordered this set. It comes very well packaged and showed up the next day. The carry case is very attractive and make travel easy. I highly recommend this product. Thanks</li>

    <li> I go through tweezers like crazy in my house. There are five of us and it seems like everyone is always needing a pair or loosing a pair some where.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive my stainless steel professional premium three piece set. There are different tips on everyone,so now we can use them just like we need to:)&lt;br /&gt;My favorite pair that I am guarding from the kids is the slanted ones.
