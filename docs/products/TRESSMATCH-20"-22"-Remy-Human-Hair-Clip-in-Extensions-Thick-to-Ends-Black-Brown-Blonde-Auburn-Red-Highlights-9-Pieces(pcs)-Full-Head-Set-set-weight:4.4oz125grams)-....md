      <li>Last time I ordered from them, the hair extensions I received were excellent.</li>

      <li>Love all Tessmatch prodcut</li>
      <li>Not to mention the price for the amount of quality is definitely more than worth it!</li>
      <li>but I was positively surprised to find out that its so soft and the color fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great product, high quality, very soft.</li>
      <li>Good overall.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly good quality, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Just as good as in the stores and definitely real human hair.</li>
      <li>&amp; I was super lucky to have hit the nail on the head with these.</li>
      <li>hair got damage quick</li>
      <li>This time, without a doubt, I must give them 1 star, and I am hoping to quickly get my refund.</li>
      <li>Came super quick.</li>
      <li>The hair is really high quality and it could not be a better match for my hair color.</li>
      <li>but they came quickly and were well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Super soft, very long, and beautiful for layering.</li>
      <li>Color was right on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always sworn by Sally&#x27;s for hair extensions, but these were just as great if not better.</li>
      <li>They are so soft and easy to clip in.</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase EVER of hair extensions</li>
      <li>THEY ARE THE REAL DEAL LADIES!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first time user of clip in hair extensions</li>
      <li>if you color it, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that because it was exactly my hair color.</li>
      <li>Almost everyone in the salon came over to compliment the exact color match &amp; quality.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t be returning to Sallys as long as these are available!</li>
      <li>This would certainly catch on fire or melt if I colored&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have ordered from Tressmatch in the past and been very pleased.</li>
      <li>This would also very quickly&lt;br</li>
      <li>THEY ARE SOFT, AND THE COLOR MATCHED MINE EXACTTTTTT!!!</li>
      <li>The hair gets tangled very easily after wearing the extensions a few times.</li>
      <li>I did read a review about possible flammability issues, while this may be true</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s multi-tonal, not one flat color, which makes it easy to blend in to your natural hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>After a burning incident during a high lightening appointment , my daughter&#x27;s hair began to fall out.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, after I removed the thin, black, hair netting, and the golden stretch bands that hold the hair extensions in a bunch, I separated them and examined them, and laid them out to put them in for first test wear.</li>
      <li>They came faster than expected and they&#x27;re so soft and silky and easy to blend.</li>
      <li>A little bit of an ashy tint and a little coarse at the ends but pretty good match.</li>
      <li>I only have positive things to say about Tressmatch extensions.</li>
      <li>Upon opening the clear package the enclosed the hair extensions</li>
      <li>I sold these to the salon that fixed my damage and purchased darker ones to match.</li>
      <li>It made me really nervous to order extensions online, especially because I didn&#x27;t think the color would match.</li>
      <li>I died it twice and its still silky soft to this day</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>My picture is from the first time I put them in - no precise application or styling.</li>

<li> It is a hazard which I take seriously, and I feel obviously there has been some sortof manufacturing error which needs to be addressed and corrected.&lt;br /</li>

<li> To make matters worse, she was to be in my neice&#x27;s wedding the following week.  </li>
<li> I ordered it thinking it would NOT fit</li>
<li> My hair is thin so this will make my hair fuller.</li>
<li> never like to give a bad review for any company.</li>
<li> Here is what was bad about this experience:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
<li> I am very unhappy and disappointed that $100 will have to be returned to me</li>
<li> Shockingly I just found an orange thread sewn into another one of the extensions!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered these and absolutely love them. They are so soft and easy to clip in. I&#x27;m a first time user of clip in hair extensions and I have had no problems with these. The color matched my hair perfectly. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Super soft, very long, and beautiful for layering. I ended up damaging my hair prior to the extensions arrival so I ended up darkening my hair to hide the damage. I sold these to the salon that fixed my damage and purchased darker ones to match. I only have positive things to say about Tressmatch extensions.</li>
    <li> Received my extension today! They are gorgeous!!! My hair is thin so this will make my hair fuller. I can&#x27;t wait to get them trimmed and start wearing them 👍🏻😀 the price is cheaper than what I was going to pay in the store by 50 bucks and I received 9 instead of 7. I&#x27;m very pleased.....</li>
    <li> hair got damage quick</li>
    <li> Perfect match! This was my first purchase EVER of hair extensions &amp; I was super lucky to have hit the nail on the head with these. I took them to my hair salon &amp; had my hair dresser out them in. Almost everyone in the salon came over to compliment the exact color match &amp; quality. She cut about 4 inches off &amp; it was still really long. I did read a review about possible flammability issues, while this may be true if you color it, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that because it was exactly my hair color. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Came super quick. A little bit of an ashy tint and a little coarse at the ends but pretty good match. A lot thicker than my last set. Good overall.</li>
    <li> The quality is great I died it twice and its still silky soft to this day</li>
    <li> Matches my hair color perfectly! Love all Tessmatch prodcut</li>
    <li> It made me really nervous to order extensions online, especially because I didn&#x27;t think the color would match. Wow. I am impressed. The hair is really high quality and it could not be a better match for my hair color. It&#x27;s multi-tonal, not one flat color, which makes it easy to blend in to your natural hair.

    <li> The hair gets tangled very easily after wearing the extensions a few times. I also do not like the feel of the hair.</li>
    <li> AT FIRST I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT PURCHASING HAIR EXTENSION ONLINE BUT IN THE STORE THEY COST AN ARM AND A LEG... I THOUGHT ABOUT SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY TO BUY IT AT THE STORE TO ENSURE THAT I COULD MATCH MY HAIR AND AVOID THE RETURN PROCESS IF THESE DID NOT MATCH MY HAIR COLOR... I THEN DECIDED TO JUST DO IT! I PURCHASED THESE EXTENSIONS AND THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. THEY ARE SOFT, AND THE COLOR MATCHED MINE EXACTTTTTT!!! IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE :) OH AND I DO EVERYTHING TO THEM, IRON, WASH, CURL... THEY ARE THE REAL DEAL LADIES!</li>
    <li> This hair is amazing.  It matches my color perfect and will be awesome for my wedding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always sworn by Sally&#x27;s for hair extensions, but these were just as great if not better. Not to mention the price for the amount of quality is definitely more than worth it! They came faster than expected and they&#x27;re so soft and silky and easy to blend. Won&#x27;t be returning to Sallys as long as these are available!</li>
    <li> Love them I would buy again look so real and look amazing !!!</li>
    <li> After a burning incident during a high lightening appointment , my daughter&#x27;s hair began to fall out.  To make matters worse, she was to be in my neice&#x27;s wedding the following week.  I express ordered the extensions and they arrived post haste.  My daughter used them the night before the wedding and the day of and she not only looked beautiful, she felt beautiful!  Priceless!</li>
    <li> I have ordered from Tressmatch in the past and been very pleased. But, this time my experience was not good, and I am following the process to request a refund after I complete writing this review. Last time I ordered from them, the hair extensions I received were excellent. Here is what was bad about this experience:&lt;br /&gt;1. Upon opening the package box, there was not an invoice enclosed, as should be, for order info and for returns.&lt;br /&gt;2. Upon opening the clear package the enclosed the hair extensions, I noticed that the golden twist tie that secures the extensions to the labeled packaging was not fulling twisted closed, and made me wonder if the product had been tampered with, or was just packaged improperly, or in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Most importantly, after I removed the thin, black, hair netting, and the golden stretch bands that hold the hair extensions in a bunch, I separated them and examined them, and laid them out to put them in for first test wear. Here is what I further discovered:&lt;br /&gt;  a. One section of clip in extensions has a long green thread sewn into them. This would certainly catch on fire or melt if I colored&lt;br /&gt;  or style my extensions, which I had intended on doing, because this is supposed to be 100% human hair. I inspected them&lt;br /&gt;  further for any noticeable problems, and found...&lt;br /&gt;  b. A second section of the hair extensions had a long piece of yellow, flat plastic sew into them! This would also very quickly&lt;br /&gt;  catch on fire or melt if I colored or style my extensions, which I had intended on doing, because this is supposed to be 100%&lt;br /&gt;  human hair.&lt;br /&gt;I never like to give a bad review for any company. Especially one that I have been so please with in the past. However, if this item became flammable or melted, it would become damaged, and also poses a risk to damaging my hair, my face, and my products that I use to color or style my hair. It is a hazard which I take seriously, and I feel obviously there has been some sortof manufacturing error which needs to be addressed and corrected.&lt;br /&gt;  c. Lastly, these extensions are advertised as 20 to 22 inches in the wording of the description. However, the labeling on the&lt;br /&gt;  package simply says &amp;#34;20 inch extensions.&amp;#34; I expected to get extensions the range from 20 to 22 inches, specifically as&lt;br /&gt;  advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I regretfully have to say, that because of the reasons above, it is not possible for me to give an &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; sort of experience with this type of product. Last time I ordered from them, I gave them 5 stars. This time, without a doubt, I must give them 1 star, and I am hoping to quickly get my refund. I no longer trust this product, and as a result, I would never spend money buying it again. It is not worth the trouble of the risk of refund. I am very unhappy and disappointed that $100 will have to be returned to me now.&lt;br /&gt;  d. Shockingly I just found an orange thread sewn into another one of the extensions! I am going to use my camera phone to try&lt;br /&gt;  and upload a photo for you.&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day.</li>
