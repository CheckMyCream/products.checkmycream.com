      <li>Great mirror, easily adjustable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s a \\&quot;nice to have\\&quot; item, it&#x27;s not something we&#x27;d purchase on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you kind of just have to wrap it around the mirror.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice mirror</li>
      <li>The side mirrors are not magnified, but I really liked having those.</li>
      <li>nice feature of this mirror is that it has an electric outlet on the front of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is especially true for mirrors like this with more magnification.</li>
      <li>What is nice about that feature is that it keeps the mirror cleaner, and you can position the mirrored door so that you can look at your ear and the side of your face.  </li>
      <li>The best part of the mirror is the two magnification settings that allow you to see really close up to do eyebrows, etc.  </li>
      <li>so flimsy.it would be nice if you could lock it into the position you need.</li>
      <li>but if you like having it handy, it is nice to know it takes a bit of room.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this Jerdon Makeup Mirror because it&#x27;s modern looking</li>
      <li>I got this mirror because the very nice one that I had did not have a way to replace the light bulbs.</li>

      <li>( the old mirror was perfect on the 5 mag side.  </li>
      <li>The lights work perfectly, emitting just the right amount of light, and it folds up well allowing for easy storage.  </li>
      <li>I can see much more detail</li>

      <li>We love the lights on it as well.  </li>
      <li>BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES IT IS TURNED OFF AND ON (PER THE INSTRUCTIONS ON FRONT)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great mirror, easily adjustable. Some people said they received warped glass which really sucks, but mine was fine on arrival. I don&#x27;t care for the lights (too bright and I don&#x27;t like the light direction), but the mirror overall is great. I don&#x27;t leave mine out but fold it and put it in a cupboard when not in use. I also dust it off before putting it away (mineral makeup). I have no yet tried the outlet on the front, but the lighting options are all very different and not particularly useful to me.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this mirror from Amazon and wish I had returned it but now I&#x27;m stuck with it. I did a lot of research and even though some reviews said the magnification mirror was warped giving a circus fun house view others said it was wonderful. The bad reviews were right. It is flimsy and the magnifying mirror reflects a poor distorted image unless you get real close and look only in the middle. I really wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
    <li> purchased a jerdon lighted makeup mirror last year.  they light bulbs went out in less that a year. it was a different model. i still purchased this one.  it is  a different model so i hope it last longer.  i have had it over a month.  i like its style better that the first one i had.  if the light bulbs go out on this one, i will probably still buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Jerdon is known for their mirrors, both hand and table top. There are a few things I really liked about the mirror, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The electrical outlet on the front face of the mirror. It allows you to use hair dryers and flat irons without taking up extra outlets.&lt;br /&gt;* The dual magnifications that easily change with a flip of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;* Three mirrors for multi-angles&lt;br /&gt;* Various color filters for times of day and lighting&lt;br /&gt;* The fact that it folds flat for storage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there were a few things I was disappointed with:&lt;br /&gt;* The first, and most major was the hinge on the back to support the mirror. It was a flimsy design that can easil slip if the user is not careful.&lt;br /&gt;* The switch to change the color filters seemed cheaply made. It is a sliding knob that rotates a column with colors on it. The lights are inside the column, and go through the filters. I don&#x27;t feel it will break anytime soon. It just looks cheap.&lt;br /&gt;* The only other complaint I have is that it is wide for travel. It would be good for make-up crews that move around, or for getting ready at a friends house, but not for regular travel. It would take up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those three complaints listed, it is a good mirror for use at home, and one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It would be perfect if the stand that held it up wasn&#x27;t so free and had a clasp on it so it wouldn&#x27;t flop around. I have a feeling that eventually it&#x27;s going to snap off.</li>
    <li> This is the 21st century counterpart of the Clairol \\&quot;True-To-Light\\&quot; make-up mirrors which came out in the late 60s - early 70s and were a \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; for all teens, at least at my school.  The gimmick was that the mirror had four light settings:  day, office, evening and home which supposedly allowed you to put on your make-up in the light you were going to be seen in.  Jerdon is re-creating these mirrors for today&#x27;s woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is relatively sturdy, and has a two-sided mirror which makes it nice for getting eyelashes out of your eye or plucking your eyebrows or seeing how gross that pimple really looks.  But the only light I ever use is the brightest one, which is day.  I never switch to the others, and I have never known anyone who did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has swing-out doors which also have mirrors on them.  What is nice about that feature is that it keeps the mirror cleaner, and you can position the mirrored door so that you can look at your ear and the side of your face.  This is especially nice for someone who might be putting on an elaborate stage make-up and needs to see better for the application of a scar or other prosthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra plug-in on the front is handy, and the mirror has held up to usage thus far when I have been carting it back and forth to dressing rooms at my local community theatre, so it seems to be doing okay in the sturdiness department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, it&#x27;s a pain that the consumer can&#x27;t change the light bulbs when they go out.  So that&#x27;s a drawback.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace an earlier model that I had for 4 years before the lights burned out and could not be replaced. I like this mirror because the light is very bright and true. It has 4 light settings, but I only use the day setting. The others are weird.&lt;br /&gt;  Problems: I like the 5 mag mirror on the reverse side. Some mag mirrors are very wavy; this one is mildly wavy but acceptable. ( the old mirror was perfect on the 5 mag side.  I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t get magnification right all the time.?)  Tthis mirror easily props up, but it slides around. It needs those round rubbery stickies on the bottom to keep it seated. Also this mirror tends to not stay in place, it swings down . The other mirror stayed in place when it turned. I keep it in place by inserting one of the cardboard pieces that were in the corners for shipping. That should not be necessary. Lastly, the lights on this mirror cannot be changed when they burn out either. In this day that is just stupid, or money making. I did buy it again in fours years. My old Clairol mirror lasted for over 30 years and had perfect 5 mag.</li>
    <li> Wife extremely happy.  Great product</li>
    <li> Returned to Amazon because look and felt cheap and mirror wad distorted a bit. Also thought sides were also zoom mirrors,  but they weren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves the mirror and the choices she has for lighting and magnification.Shecwill be sharing it with her mom and sister.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a well made mirror.  My wife had the previous model. the JGL9W (I did not know the model number until we started looking for new mirrors) until it broke, and I bought her this one to replace it.  This seems to be more substantial and better made than the old one model.  I also like the cleaner lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighting is adequate and my wife prefers the 5X Magnification instead of the 10 some other mirrors offer.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift,looks real good,she got her face in it all the time, guess it&#x27;s OK with her to</li>
    <li> This mirror is FABULOUS! I bought it because my bathroom and bedroom lights are horrible for doing hair and makeup.  It exceeded my expectations on so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple settings for the mirror&#x27;s lighting - home, evening, office, outdoors.  The &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; setting alone made up for the purchase price.  You won&#x27;t look overly made-up or washed out under florescent lighting, and the evening setting helps you get perfectly fixed up for a night at the clubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The three-way mirror and the outlet are indispensable for proper hairstyling.  You get a great view from all angles, and your curling iron or hair iron can be plugged into the mirror instead of the wall - which relieves the annoyance of short appliance plugs vs wall outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror can be set at a variety of angles, thanks to the easily adjustable slider in the back.  It folds up for travel or storage when you&#x27;re done. I expected to use it only at home, but take it on trips because it&#x27;s so light and easy to pack.  Business travelers will love it - it serves SO well in badly-lit hotel rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY love the magnification mirror (you simply flip the center mirror for this).  It magnifies your pores to moon craters, which is tremendously helpful if you need to cover up blackheads, scars or other blemishes, under-eye circles or just need help inserting your contact lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is well worth the price and gives you the same level of service as more expensive, professional makeup mirrors.  I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to young relatives who were learning to apply cosmetics and as a shower gift to a friend who did her own wedding makeup.  They loved it too.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> very poorly made would not recommend this product shutter broke the first time my daughter used ti</li>
    <li> This took up a lot of room when opened up and even when closed and sitting out. More room than a pedestal mirror. I didn&#x27;t think the light was bright enough and wanted more magnification out of the mirror (I&#x27;m used to a 9x). The side mirrors are not magnified, but I really liked having those. Main issues were the brightness of the light (I never would have used it in the dimmer settings) and the magnification for me, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> If they would have made a way to &amp;#34;fold&amp;#34; this up neatly I would have give 5 stars. The plastic piece that holds it up is very flimsy and can not be &amp;#34;clipped&amp;#34; down, same for the metal piece. This looks like it is VERY easily breakable and then will be almost useless because it wont stand up on its own. the Mirror itself is nice, the 5 X magnification is pretty distorted.. dont know if I will ever use that, but you never know.</li>
    <li> Had searched many stores to find one that was similar to my old one. Found it and very pleased with product!</li>
    <li> I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this Tri-Fold mirror with its various light settings.  The problem was the center mirror itself. For some reason, it warped every view and every angle - kinda like those freaky circus mirrors that you walk past on the boardwalk.  The reflection made me dizzy.  I sent it back immediately.  Fortunately, Amazon has great customer service so nothing was lost, but this product could use a little inspection by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I love the 3 mirrors and the magnification of the flip mirror. However, the lighting is not bright enough and the different settings (Day, office, Evening, Home) lights make it even darker and not very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this until I can justify spending money on a new one with brighter lighting.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a five star review but the stand that holds it up is so flimsy.it would be nice if you could lock it into the position you need.</li>
    <li> The magnification is not strong enough and it looks &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement. Not really what I wanted or the quality I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;The magnification isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Just what the wife wanted.</li>
    <li> My little girl is getting into makeup.  We made her a vanity and wanted a mirror to sit on top.  She loves this one!  It&#x27;s compact and she can see what she is doing.  No more standing over the sink!  We love the lights on it as well.  She feels just like a little movie star in her own little dressing room!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Jerdon Makeup Mirror because it&#x27;s modern looking and I can leave it up and open on my bathroom vanity all the time.  It was twice the price of the last Jerdon Mirror I purchased a year ago and I hope it will last twice as long.  The only thing I&#x27;m not happy about is that you can&#x27;t change the light bulbs yourself, it has to be brought to a repair shop - who ever came up with that idea???  The 5X magnification is a good feature.  I would recommend this mirror to friends and family.</li>
    <li> The magnification mirror is more like a fun house mirror unless you get extremely close to it.</li>
    <li> Really nice lighting with different light settings.  Fits easily in standard size vanity drawer when not in use. Has many adjustments, very useful multi function make up mirror.</li>
    <li> Great for what I needed it for. Light weight, and bright</li>
    <li> The magnification side of the mirror is a little distorted.</li>
    <li> very nice and compact</li>
    <li> I love the style of the mirror (able to close side doors which keeps dust, etc. off mirror) but the mirror, itself, seems to be distorted unless I sit VERY close to it.  I wish the &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; light was brighter since that is pretty much the only one I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching a very long time for the perfect mirror, my search is over!</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. The lights do not work correctly and the stand is extremely poor design</li>
    <li> This would be great for younger ladies or small petites. It is not wide enough for me and the side views are useless. The magnification does not impress me. I need a 10X at this age.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror. I use it every morning for my makeup routine. I like the magnification it has, don&#x27;t always like what I see. :) I am grateful that I can actually see what I look like before leaving the house. I was making some mistakes before but not any more.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Quality and Value and this store had what I needed and when you plan ahead items are shipped within 5 days. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my 19 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday. She loves it. Uses it every day. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do not like the fact that on the magnification side, there is too much distortion except in the very middle of the mirror.  So, if you want to see both eyes, for example, when putting on eye makeup, you cannot do it without feeling like you are suffering from vertigo or are looking at yourself in a fun house mirror!  The lighting part is great - just not the magnification.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror because the very nice one that I had did not have a way to replace the light bulbs. I depended on the customer reviews to tell me that the mirror was good. Unfortunately, that has not been my experience. I&#x27;m going to list the pros and cons because that will be easier to read, and I find those kinds of reviews helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The center mirror swings 360 degrees both ways. (My old one only went 180 degrees, and only in one direction for each side.)&lt;br /&gt;2. The lighting is excellent and even, without some lighted spots and some not lighted.&lt;br /&gt;3. The side mirrors fold inward.&lt;br /&gt;4. The mirror remains stable at whatever angle you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The device is very lightweight plastic and feels cheap. Because of the light weight, it&#x27;s easily knocked over.&lt;br /&gt;2. The side mirrors are so small that they are essentially useless, even though they look about the same size as the main mirror in the picture on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;3. The magnification side is only 5X. I didn&#x27;t think that would matter, but it does. (My old one was 10X.)&lt;br /&gt;4. The 4 different lighting types seem like a gimmick to me. I wonder how they even decided which colors to use for which environment. I just leave it on one now, after trying the other ones and finding them useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, maybe I should have realized what type of mirror this would be by the relatively inexpensive price, but I wish that I hadn&#x27;t purchased it. Paying more for a decent 10X mirror made of metal would have better for me.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I purchased it as an &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; item so I only paid $5.99 for it...but it&#x27;s great.  The different lighting settings are a bit ambitious but it&#x27;s nice to see the difference between the office lighting and the day lighting.  It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and folds up well.  The magnification helps with my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> When the mirror came, it was packaged really good, and I was very hopeful about this mirror, but the first time using it, the button will not move to control the lighting of it...it felt like it was stuck, I pushed harder, and it popped right out, feels as tho it was make cheaply</li>
    <li> I sometimes like to sit outside of the bathroom and watch TV while getting ready, so I thought I&#x27;d give this lighted makeup mirror a try.  After using it a couple of times, I am completely underwhelmed.  The best part of the mirror is the two magnification settings that allow you to see really close up to do eyebrows, etc.  But that&#x27;s about the only thing I&#x27;d use it for.  The mirror has different settings for different types of light, like daytime, evening, etc. Honestly, there was not much of a difference between any of them and I don&#x27;t think they imitate realistic lighting situations at all.  More gimmicky than useful.  The unit is very large and cumbersome, made of plastic.  The slider that is used to change to different light settings is very flimsy plastic and gets stuck all the time.  For the price, it is extremely disappointing. That&#x27;s my personal opinion, of course, maybe teenage girls might enjoy it but I&#x27;ll be sticking with my regular mirror on the bathroom wall to do my make up.</li>
    <li> I  bought this lamp to help me see to put on my make up in the Mornings.  It looks nice, not to big, not to little. I would buy this Jerdon Tri-Fold lighted mirror again.</li>
    <li> good price, regular mirror is great, but magnified side not great.  Not as magnified as in more expensive mirrors.  Lights are great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as a present; she loves it!</li>
    <li> I so not care for this product.  The magnification mirror is like looking in a fun house mirror.  I had owned a mirror from Clariol and it was way better quality than this one.</li>
    <li> works great  and using it every day</li>
    <li> Really nice mirror and light set up. Love the options in the lighting</li>
    <li> I used this lighted mirror for one month and today it burnt out.  It sizzled and then lights were out.  Amazon couldn&#x27;t replace it since it happened after 30 days but Jerdon had excellent customer service and is sending me a replacement.  I&#x27;ll upgrade or downgrade my rating once I see how long the next mirror lasts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, however, the magnifying side is not.  It&#x27;s wavy.  Otherwise I like the regular mirror and lights.</li>
    <li> It is not magnified enough for me, must return.</li>
    <li> The mirror&#x27;s light switch failed after operating only one time.  The lights now cannot be turned on.  This renders the Jerdon 10W essentially useless since my wife must have abundant lighting to properly apply her makeup.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this product is light weight and without rubber feet, it easily slides about on the counter.  I could easily correct this issue by adding rubber feet, but since the lights cannot be turned on, it would serve no purpose.</li>
    <li> Replaced the less useful, magnifying mirror by my bedside.  Lighting options are great.  If I could change one thing would have the backside of the mirror a 10X instead of a 5X version.  I use this all the time now.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the mirror...it has lines going thru it...as long as I concentrate on the object and not the mirror itself, its useable.  Very disappointed.  If I didn&#x27;t need it so much, I would have sent it back. Thought I was getting a quality mirror.....unfortunately I was mistaken.</li>
    <li> This is an ok quality mirror with reasonable magnification but it takes up too much space on the already crowded bathroom vanity area around the sink. That&#x27;s where it makes most sense for me but with the fold out panels it needs a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I use the metal stand type magnification mirror that can be flipped around for magnification/regular mirror and has a lighted circular band around it which mimics indoor light. That mirror is taller and so I don&#x27;t have to bend to apply makeup. This Jerdon mirror is meant for a sit down arrangement in my opinion, which reduces its usefulness for me.  It would be great if your bathroom has a tall stand where you can place this mirror. The fold out feature is great for hair styling and an outlet is located conveniently in front of the mirror but unless it&#x27;s placed at the right height it takes away the convenience. But it&#x27;s a little smaller than needed for hairstyling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things about the mirror are options for 4 types of fluoroscent lighting, which can be useful especially if your bathroom has the yellower lighting which does not show the true colors of makeup. Other than that I think the stand magnification mirrors sold in large warehouses etc. are much more convenient and take up less space for bathroom usage and are at sub $20 prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice mirror but I won&#x27;t be using it much unless I can find a dedicated space for it in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Although lightweight enough for travel, the Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification and 4-Light Settings, probably won&#x27;t get out of most bathrooms once users realize they cannot change out a light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello manufactured obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* The unit includes a convenient 120-volt electrical outlet built-in for curling irons, blow dryers and other appliances.&lt;br /&gt;* The center mirror swivels from 1x to 5x magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* You can&#x27;t change the light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;* The four adjustable settings for color correct lighting aren&#x27;t as useful (or as accurate) as promised.&lt;br /&gt;* The unit needs a better base/footing to stop it from sliding on smooth surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Three stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback.

    <li> There is no perfect make-up mirror, I&#x27;ve found.  But in my quest of many decades, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  The light is much brighter and truer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I can see much more detail and, finally, can actually see what shade of lipstick I&#x27;m wearing (impossible with the oval, flip mirror I&#x27;d been using recently).  My only complaint is that they still don&#x27;t make a mirror that&#x27;s large enough for my tastes, which is why I give it 4 starts instead of 5.  But compared to everything else out there I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s a 5.</li>
    <li> Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification and 4-Light Settings, White Finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a quality, lighted make-up mirror that is not too bulky and is lightweight enough to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror is impressive right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plastic white housing with an adjustable metal/plastic stand, easy flip make-up mirror (1X and 5X magnification)  that  uses cool florescent lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a plug-in (AC) outlet on the front of the mirror housing for a curling iron, blow drier (or, whatever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple slide lighting bar that allows one to choose proper lighting for different situations:  Day, Office, Evening or Home light. Very Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the plug-in cord is a bit bulky and stiff, but nothing that one cannot get used to.  Also, I noticed that the make-up mirror does slide around on smooth surfaces -- which is a need-to-know if one plugs anything into the front AC outlet (that may move around, in use) -- like a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror easy to use, travel with, apply make-up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Pleasure to use.  Everything works! *smiles*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Jerdon Euro Tabletop Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification and 4-Light Settings, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in this product. It was broken where you slide the light to get the right lighting, it wouldn&#x27;t budge and the little knob fell off immediately. I do not recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to throw their money away.</li>
    <li> Gave to wife for christmas, she has used now for 3 weeks with no problem. Turned it on yesterday and nothing. Tapped on it a few times and it came on. turned it off then back on,, nothing. Tapped on it agian and it came on. Apears to have a loose or broken wire. You think they could make them a little more sterdy then this.</li>
    <li> I worked good for my friend to put her new airbrush make-up on. Big point is it can be moved to wherever she needs to do that as well as travel with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS AN UPDATE. THE LIGHTS ON THE UNIT WON&#x27;T COME ON NOW AFTER ONLY BEING USED 5 TIMES. tODAY IS THE 31ST DAY AFTER RECEIVING IT SO I CAN&#x27;T SEND IT BACK. THE UNIT GETS POWER WHEN THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON (THE OUTLET ON THE SIDE WORKS) BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES IT IS TURNED OFF AND ON (PER THE INSTRUCTIONS ON FRONT) THE LIGHTS NEVER LIGHT.</li>
    <li> In general, this is a pretty good makeup mirror; but, there are some issues that prevent it from being a stellar product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The lighting quality is not that great. That&#x27;s kind of a big deal on this type of product. The light color is off and makes you look kind of green...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The light settings aren&#x27;t very well thought out. The &#x27;office&#x27; setting, for example, is actually 100% off - so it doesn&#x27;t provide any light at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I would probably recommend looking at other comparable products.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She loves it. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay still it tilt down the light blinds you from seeing your face useless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a little, since I don&#x27;t do a lot of makeup (I&#x27;m so beautiful already . . . ). I did find it quite useful for examining one&#x27;s eyes to get things out of them, etc., as I could get much closer than I could to a wall mirror, and the 5x magnification side helped even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic construction seems about average for this price range of items. There are many features which could come in handy, like the filters to alter the color balance of the light to check one&#x27;s makeup for different lighting conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not consider this an item for traveling, but rather for a fairly fixed placement on a vanity. Short of a regular makeup mirror and desk, I think it could be quite useful for applying makeup, especially if one is a little short of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the AC outlet on the front for other appliances, like a hair dryer or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were only 2 flaws that I could see. The first one is that when folded flat, there was no way to secure the loser part of the stand on the back, and it would flop all over the place when moving the mirror, unless you held it in place. A minor quibble, but potential problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that the light bulbs were not user-replaceable. In this day and age, there is not excuse for that. The 6 inch fluorescent bulbs are still fairly common, and being able to replace them yourself when they fail (as they will fail) should be a given. It is pretty ridiculous to have to send this in or take it to some rare repair center just to change a light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those 2 flaws cost a star.</li>
    <li> I am serious about this - this is the best make up light I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is the best. The trifold, flip open view is great. I can see places I could not see as clearly in my previous 2 make up mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t heat up (a problem with previous make-up mirrors). There&#x27;s even a place to plug something into it, if you want. I like that it has a warranty. And it is much more stable than any of my previous mirrors too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! I hope it never breaks!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it.  The tri-fold mirror is great and the illumination with the different settings is good.  A good price point for this particular mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my original Jerdon mirror.  As someone who uses a lighted makeup mirror daily, features such as tri-fold and magnification options are of most importance.  My former model was excellent (JGL9W) and lasted over 5 years.  THIS updated model is cheap!!!  The side mirrors are small and awkward.  The magnification mirror is awful!  Very distorted!  If you need magnification to apply eye makeup, pass on this mirror!  Highly recommend model JGL9W.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve owned similar item in the past because the lighting is so helpful.  I&#x27;ve tried placing it in different areas to get proper lighting.  Now it&#x27;s back in the box, it&#x27;s not at all helpful.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this mirror( because the design is really pretty), that I threw out the packaging before I tried it out.  The light is really good and the natural (non-magnified) side of the mirror is fine, but the magnified side looks like it came straight from a carnival fun house!  It&#x27;s AWFUL!  I was getting a headache just trying to focus to apply my eyeliner!  If I would have kept the packaging, I would return this because of that.  I really need the magnified side because I wear glasses, but there&#x27;s NO WAY I&#x27;ll be using it on this.</li>
    <li> I really like the design of this mirror.  It works great for a close view.  It is light weight so you can take it with you.  However, this same feature causes it to be somewhat unstable when on a vanity.  It really is worth buying.  I&#x27;m happy with my Jerdon  mirror.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box the lighting slider broke and the lighting could not be changed.  I am returning immediately for a refund.  Save your money and look for another brand.  This one is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> RUN!  I wish I would have read the reviews more carefully.  Purchased this for myself, and within 3 months (turned it on about 15 times) turned it on to watch the lights slowly fade to nothing.  Guess what... it doesn&#x27;t have changeable bulbs.  Was fine while it lasted, but it appears I am not the only one to experience such disappointment in this product.  I will replace this with a more reliable product.</li>
    <li> Awful mirror...way to expensive for cheap construction, distorted mirrors and poor lighting. Try a better manufacturer for quality..would not buy again and might just go thru trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter loved it.  She can use it away from home which is great.</li>
    <li> I had to send it back!  The mirror was very distorted, gave me a head ach to look into it!  The Conair mirror is much better!</li>
    <li> My small-ish make-up mirror finally bit the dust so I was excited about getting a larger tri-fold one.  I read the reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait until this one arrived.  When I hooked it up and used it for the first time I flipped the mirror to the 5x&#x27;s magnification side and my face and head were....square.  It really was kind of comical.  I could move my face in different directions in the mirror and it would stretch out in amusing and grotesque ways.  It was like a fun house mirror.  What the...???  Needless to say, this mirror is going back pronto and I am getting another one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> There is some distortion in the magnification side of the mirror. I did not have this problem with my previous makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> I used model JGL9W for years and it was fine until the bulbs burned out.  The huge complaint I have with Jerdon is that they don&#x27;t make these lighted mirrors so that you can replace the bulbs.  What a waste!  I guess it&#x27;s the only way they get us to buy another mirror.  Anyway, I got this one as a replacement and it&#x27;s awful.  The 5X magnification side has so much distortion that when I move my head (in order to see another area of my face closer) while looking into the mirror, it literally made me nauseous and I remained this way long after I stopped using it.  I didn&#x27;t have this problem with my older model.  I immediately put this piece of junk in the box and am sending it back.  Also, it seems like the plastic is cheaper than the former model.  When I moved the lever at the bottom to change the lighting, the little knob popped off.  I was able to put it back in but how ridiculous that a brand new product already has pieces falling off.  My former mirror is more than 10 years old and that never happened.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. It was exactly what I was expecting and she loves it. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This is what Robin wanted. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. It is actually much more sturdy and larger than it appears in the picture. The mirror&#x27;s construction is high quality, and the center mirror pivots to allow you to switch between regular and high magnification. One word of caution, though: as with any mirror, please be certain not to place this product in the path of direct sunlight to avoid starting a fire. This is especially true for mirrors like this with more magnification. This safety note is described in the instructions, of course, but repetition in the name of safety never hurts!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this Jerdon makeup mirror.  It has some nice features with the multiple lighting options, mirror angles, and mirror magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she doesn&#x27;t like and I also noticed is it is bulky and hard to quickly store.  The center mirror spins around when trying to move it.  The cord does not have a cord wrap so you kind of just have to wrap it around the mirror.  Also the mirror stand fell apart during the first week of use - the metal stand pops out of the mirror slots and you have to put it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, useful for applying makeup.  But build quality and design could be a bit better for ease of use.  At around $50, I give it 3-stars for price/value.</li>
    <li> The Jerdon tri-fold lighted mirror has some good points and some bad, so here are the good points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5X mirror I can see very well and makes it easy to get anything out of your eye or to put make-up on. The 1X is good and both are clear and look good. The side mirrors are fair size and are adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has 4 light settings: Day, Office, Evening and Home. The office setting looks strange on my mirror regardless of where it is at, but maybe it is just my mirror with this. The others look fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights are bright enough but nothing super bright. It does the job in other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the built in electric outlet to plug in curling irons, hair dryers, nail dryers, or whatever you want to plug in, that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big center mirror does tilt up and down and I can usually find the right position for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now what I don&#x27;t like about it or its bad points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand I hate. You can&#x27;t put it into a solid position but it goes all over the place whenever you travel or move it. Why didn&#x27;t they make something to hold that stands still?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights you can&#x27;t change! What? I just have to cross my fingers the lights will last but I mean really, why not have easy to change bulbs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t lock the mirrors with a clasp or button. They just fold and you leave them there but already while moving it, some clothes hung on one door and pulled the door almost off. It didn&#x27;t do any permanent damage but why not have something to lock the mirrors down? So I supposed this is one to only leave at home. I would not suggest traveling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is bulky. It isn&#x27;t the 1970s huge bulky mirror, but for today, it is bulkier than most. If left at home though, I guess this wouldn&#x27;t be a minus unless you need the space. It just isn&#x27;t for suitcase traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in all, it is a good basic mirror but one I will leave home.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product to apply my make-up, because it can provide more natural lighting and help give a better view of my skin. The mirror sits on my desk, and I can comfortably use the mirror in a seated position. It has an outlet for an appliance, such as a flat-iron or hair dryer, but I have not used this feature. Overall, the product works well but I have to take away a star because the price is too excessive.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! It magnifies just the right amount to see to put my makeup on. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great size and lighting. Does have an annoying buzz when lights on. Love the tri fold doors on it and the 5x magnify.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror so I could apply makeup using the magnifier mirror, without wearing my glasses. Much to my dismay, that is impossible.  The magnifier mirror is more like a &amp;#34;fun house&amp;#34; mirror causing major distortion up and down the mirror. Having successfully used this type of mirror ensemble before from another brand, I am very disappointed with this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s vanity. It replaced her old Jerdon tri fold. This new improved one is fantastic. Perfect lighting, a large middle mirror that flips for closer magnification, along with the side mirrors and a plug up front (charges her phone while doing her makeup) she can&#x27;t live without this mirror and takes it on any trips. Highly recommend this and may buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> Great work item arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the wife, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this poorly made make up mirror , magnifying side impossible to use. The mirror on that side is too warped, it&#x27;s worst than a mirror in a FUN HOUSE !!!! I returned it ...</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a mirror in my home.  It seems that everyone is always getting ready at the same time, and my wife and daughter seem to occupy all the mirrors doing makeup and other things.  I saw this and jumped at the opportunity to free up some bathroom time and hopefully get at least one of them out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They now race to see who can get to this thing first.  They rave about how the light adjusts, anywhere from the harsh \\&quot;Highlights every flaw for plucking, popping, or hiding\\&quot; to the smooth \\&quot;Makes me look natural and lets me put on makeup under normal light.\\&quot;  Having tried it myself to groom my facial hair, it really does make a difference depending on which light intensity is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tri-fold aspect is useful as well.  It allows the light to be used from different directions, and allows for your face/head to be viewed from offest angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire unit is lightweight, yet stays stable and balanced when in use.  This thing made me a hero at my house; my wife and daugther have a makeup and hair station, and my son and I can now use the bathroom mirror to get ready ourselves.  The only problem is I am now being asked to buy a second, so my wife and daughter dont have to take turns with this one.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, multiple light settings, unlimited ways to position, and a VERY reasonable price! !  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the size and style of this make up mirror, and would recommend it to anyone.  The lighting is good, and it looks very nice on my vanity.  Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because my eyes aren&#x27;t great anymore, and I thought the magnification would be stronger.</li>
    <li> This mirror provides so much for the money, it is not very sophisticated looking however really gets the job done. A good buy!</li>
    <li> We did not receive the mirror in the picture.  The mirror we received does not have the folding side mirrors.  That being said, it is still a pretty good makeup mirror.  My wife and daughters use it and all like it.  It has 4 light settings, Day, Night, Office, Home with a rotating mirror.  One side is magnified.  The lights work well, the mirror is a good size.  The women in my house think the cord is plenty long.  The stand is adjustable, so you can decide how much lean you want in the mirror.  Good mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, time will tell if its a great one, e.g durable, scratch resistant, etc. lose of a star because the product is a bit bulky though not to the point of cumbersome. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an obvious design flaw, one only has to look around to dee thinner products of the same?&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless it does what it does well. I believe the difference in the reviews is the expectation that this is a high rend product when in essenens it&#x27;s a very good product for its price point.&lt;br /&gt;The lights are certainly sufficient (though they don&#x27;t bend back as you&#x27;d expect)&lt;br /&gt;It functions as it should&lt;br /&gt;Decent price&lt;br /&gt;3x mag.&lt;br /&gt;Should work well fork most most</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. It was defective.</li>
    <li> i put alot of though into buying this&lt;br /&gt;mirror. the price was a bit high and i did&lt;br /&gt;my homework. when i took it out of the&lt;br /&gt;box it was marked up with a dark film that&lt;br /&gt;is nearly impossible to get off. the mirror&lt;br /&gt;functions just as described and im&lt;br /&gt;pleased with that. the kicker... the stand&lt;br /&gt;to hold the mirror in differet positions is&lt;br /&gt;horrible! it never is right amd very easily disturbed. example, if you slide your&lt;br /&gt;already set up mirror 2 inches to the side&lt;br /&gt;it will throw the mirror stand off or&lt;br /&gt;collapse it. i didnt return because i threw away the box</li>
    <li> Mirror is just ok.  The magnifier should be stronger, the mirror space is a little small.  It&#x27;s the best of several other average options.</li>
    <li> Wow love this mirror. Works great!!</li>
    <li> This is a convenient, lighted, tri-fold mirror. It is functional but not super stylish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center mirror very handily rotates to provide 5X magnification. Side mirrors adjust to capture just about any view. The mirror&#x27;s stand allows adjustments so that I can use it standing or sitting. The electric outlet on the front would come in handy if my main styling appliances didn&#x27;t have 3 prong grounded plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, I prefer the more natural look of the incandescent lighting on my higher end make up mirror. Compared to it, the florescent lights make lighter shades of lipstick, particularly pink, look deceptively brighter, and blush appears heavier. If this was my go to makeup mirror, it would take a couple of applications to make the adjustment between what I see in sunlight versus the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems to be appropriate for the price, but it&#x27;s lightweight and toppled easily on day one. Just after unplugging it, I turned and accidentally popped one of the open side mirrors with my elbow. The whole thing took a dive from the counter-top to the carpeted floor. It came out pretty much unscathed except that the side mirrors don&#x27;t close flush anymore. Given my klutzy nature, this is probably not going to be a long lived appliance.</li>
    <li> As I get older, I really don&#x27;t enjoy the way I look when I hover over a mirror. The unfortunate thing about this mirror is that, even at it&#x27;s most upright position, it has about a 30 degree tilt from the base going up. So you have to lean forward over vanity or sink to be able to see yourself - or get someone to hold the rather heavy unit. No matter what the lighting option I picked, it did nothing to offset the leaning effect. I would have to mount this on a wall up high to do eye makeup properly. Plus the unit is so bulky and heavy that unless I mount it on a wall (and I don&#x27;t have a spare surface to mount it to,) it takes up too much space to store under the bath vanity or on the counter. I really don&#x27;t want to have to keep it under my bed. Would love to trade this in on a smaller, lightweight, straight-up lit mirror and forego all the magnification, lighting options, and swivel effects.</li>
    <li> No Im not satisfied with this at all. I need to send it back. The different light adjustment broke the second time I used it. So for the next week I used it, I had one side of the mirror with evening light, and the other side with daylight.</li>
    <li> My daughter should be able to use this for years.  Great for girls learning to apply make up.</li>
    <li> I have been using a smaller makeup mirror forever that has one settings and two different mirrors. I love the different light settings- Makes such a huge difference when putting on makeup.. The only complaint is the stand seems a little too loose- I am always afraid it will fall over with a small push, so I ensure I put in a place in my bathroom that it will be sturdy- Otherwise very happy with this mirror- Such a huge difference seeing the different light settings.. Not sure how I went without for so long!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  The lights work perfectly, emitting just the right amount of light, and it folds up well allowing for easy storage.  I haven&#x27;t owned a makeup mirror before, however, I have used one regularly and this mirror fits the bill.  My makeup looks better after using this mirror to apply it.  My bathroom is fairly dark, and it&#x27;s hard to see if I have rubbed all my foundation in evenly, or applied my eyeliner straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the main mirror rotates up, so if I am standing at my counter doing my makeup, I can rotate it up so I don&#x27;t have to lean so far down to look in the mirror.  The unit has a stand on the back with notches so you can adjust how far back you want it to lean.  The side mirrors really don&#x27;t do anything for me, but they are nice to have.  When the mirrors fold down, it provides a protective casing for the unit, which makes it easy to travel with.  This mirror is built sturdy and is one of the only instances where the actual product looks better then the picture.  I am very satisfied with this mirror, and so far it has worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> This mirror has an adjustable stand. You can adjust the angle from fairly upright to about 60 degrees from the table (which is quite a steep angle. I&#x27;m not sure how that would be useful). Anyway, the mirror rotates easily. It has 1X and 5X magnification. The light has 4 different filters. The daylight one is the best. It is simply a white light. I don&#x27;t really find the 3 others (office, evening, and home) useful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice feature of this mirror is that it has an electric outlet on the front of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that bothers me the most about this mirror is that it is rather bulky.</li>
    <li> This tri-fold mirror arrived as pictured. The center mirror flips to reveal either a normal side or a 5x magnification. PERFECT for those of us \\&quot;of a certain age\\&quot; who need a bit of help seeing those pesky plucking needs! :)&lt;br /&gt;I like the side mirrors for seeing my jawline and making sure that makeup is well blended.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror lights to 4 different settings: daytime,evening,home,and office. I found the home setting to be a little odd. I would think that \\&quot;home\\&quot; would match either daytime or evening?&lt;br /&gt;This unit is rather bulky on your counter, and not easy to store as it doesn&#x27;t collapse at all.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the extra outlet on the side! PERFECT for a curling or straightening iron!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this mirror to anyone who has the space to use it.</li>
    <li> The Jerdon Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror is a favorite of my wife and my daughter who needs glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - According to them the settings are accurate when you are putting you your make-up for the office, the evening, and days outside.  The two side mirrors are helpful to folks whose vision isn&#x27;t 20/20 or don&#x27;t have the best peripheral vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral Comment - This mirror takes a bit more room with the side mirrors so if you plan on keeping it out for daily use, it is a good idea to have a dresser top or desk area for it.  The side-mirrors do fold-up easily, so you can condense the space but if you like having it handy, it is nice to know it takes a bit of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Via the Amazon Vine program, I decided to get the Jerdon JGL10W Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror for my wife to try out. The magnification mirror we currently have in the bathroom is not real nice, and I thought this might be a good improvement. We found it has some nice features, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will end up being something that&#x27;s used continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification works well, and it works for both close-up jobs (like removing something from an eye) and makeup. She also liked the different lighting options. It&#x27;s amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I&#x27;m not quite sure I&#x27;d want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that&#x27;s not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity. As noted in other reviews, the item that seems to make the least sense is that the bulbs can&#x27;t be replaced. You&#x27;re basically risking a $60 purchase on a $2 light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s a \\&quot;nice to have\\&quot; item, it&#x27;s not something we&#x27;d purchase on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> Every sweet adeline needs a makeup mirror for prepping for performances, and this one fits the bill!  I had a makeup mirror like this thirty years ago and had forgotten how useful they are!  The different lighting options help with color accuracy.  ONly wish it had a batteries-only option for those times when an electrical outlet is not readily available, but otherwise, no complaints.  This is a great, light-weigh makeup mirror!</li>
