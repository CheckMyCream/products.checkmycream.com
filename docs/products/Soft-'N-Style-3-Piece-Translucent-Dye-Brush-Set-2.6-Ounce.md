<li> The bristles are sturdy enough for my thick hair and did the job.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the brushes, the foil, or just my lack of experience, but using these made it a lot harder to do stuff.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure how they compare to others</li>
<li> the brushes were stiff and hard to work with.</li>
<li> At least I think it does.  </li>

    <li> Very high quality, great value! It&#x27;s so great to have my own brushes, it makes dyeing my hair at home so much better. Also the colors are cute. My roommate like to use them too, and there are plenty in the pack to share.</li>
    <li> Great and serve their purpose!</li>
    <li> I only received one brush.</li>
    <li> I got these to color my hair rainbow. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the brushes, the foil, or just my lack of experience, but using these made it a lot harder to do stuff. the brushes were stiff and hard to work with. but that might just be what tint brushes are! So I would not recommend these, but i would not (un?) recommend them either.</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying SPLAT!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and am now gonna put it to use.</li>
    <li> The brush is easy to use and easy to clean.  There is no mess when I color my hair.  I can just brush the color in, let it set and wash it out.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  At least I think it does.  I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing, and just kind of winged it.</li>
    <li> goes well with the Splat hair color</li>
