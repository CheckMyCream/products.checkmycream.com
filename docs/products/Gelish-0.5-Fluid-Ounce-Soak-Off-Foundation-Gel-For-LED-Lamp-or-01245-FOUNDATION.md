      <li>I think Gelish did a great job with its brush too; it&#x27;s short, stiff and perfect to apply the gel.</li>

      <li>It goes on very smoothly, but you have to make sure to only put it on your nail ( not your skin or cuticle area).  </li>
      <li>Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better</li>

      <li>Love Gelish products - easy to apply and the last very well.</li>
      <li>I find gels to be the best option for me as they cure fast and do not have long dry times and stay nice longer and make my nails a bit stronger so they break less easily.  </li>
      <li>Gelish is great for me because I have always had thin nails which easily tore, then ripped all the way off.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra cash to have shiny, smooth nails!</li>
      <li>great value for such a big bottle.</li>

      <li>I have used several different Gelish Polishes and have been very satisfied with all of them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the short cuts such as using rubbing alcohol instead of primer, pure acetone rather than \\&quot;gel cleanser\\&quot;, all have worked great but you cannot get the same effect without the foundation.</li>

      <li>Second issue with this product I keep having is that, it&#x27;s not lasting more than 4 days.</li>
      <li>I use a cuticle stick that I soak in alcohol to remove excess on the sides of my nails and found this works the best.&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gelish is one of the best!</li>
    <li> You must have the foundation prior to trying to use the gel color polish. This works great &amp; I use the gel polish when I can&#x27;t make it to have a manicure.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  My former career was as a nail tech.  Adheres well to the nail plate.</li>
    <li> Well what else do you use when you have the Gelish system.  I love anything Gelish!</li>
    <li> The foundation does not work for me.  When I use this product, the actual layer of nail polish gets all wavy.  I do not use this product and cannot find a good foundation to use.</li>
    <li> I have spent many years getting my nails done at salons.  I also have done my own nails for years too.  This product is better than shellac.  I find that this product is more flexable and doesn&#x27;t peel off as easy at shellac.  The gel base is stronger and helps keep brittle nails from breaking, flaking, and peeling.  If you can paint your own nails then you can do this.  A couple of tips: use a thin coat of the gel base (thicker isn&#x27;t better), and paint the ends of the nails to seal the edges (this will make the polish last longer).</li>
    <li> This works well as a base coat, it&#x27;s a bit thick but manageable, I don&#x27;t love the short bush but apparently that&#x27;s the gel thing because all but one of my base gels have short brushes like this</li>
    <li> I have used several different Gelish Polishes and have been very satisfied with all of them. They perform as described.</li>
    <li> My nail tech uses this and it is great but I couldn&#x27;t get my old gel polish off that the nail tech put on over the gelish so I went back to regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Helps nails look healthy, especially people with very thin nail beds or very flat nail beds. Applying 2 coats is the best way to go.</li>
    <li> In my honest opinion, this is the best foundation that you can buy.  Even though I use different brands of colored gel polish to go over it, I only use the Gelish base coat.  It goes on very smoothly, but you have to make sure to only put it on your nail ( not your skin or cuticle area).  If you accidentally put it on your skin, there is a good chance that it will peel off and take some of the polish on your fingernail with it.  The base coat does a great job of making the polish stick to your finger as well as keeping it on your finger for at least 2 weeks.  I normally change my polish about two weeks after I put it on because it starts to peel of grow out.  Not all people&#x27;s nails peel though it just depends on your level of oil in your nailbeds.  I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I got a great price for this in salon stores it is triple only downfall is that the price has gone up due to supply and demand not their fault just people are doing their own nails more will buy again</li>
    <li> Great for use with the oink IBD flex.</li>
    <li> I tried other gel polishes and found them more difficult to apply. this works well and stays on for 2 weeks. I use a cuticle stick that I soak in alcohol to remove excess on the sides of my nails and found this works the best.&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love gel nails. I recently discovered this system while visiting my sister, I tried her kit and loved the results! The gel stayed on for me about two weeks, but I could probably stretch it to 3 if I was careful. Gelish is great for me because I have always had thin nails which easily tore, then ripped all the way off.  I used to do acrylic on my nails to grow them out without breaking but that was timely and costly. With this I just brush it on like regular nail polish. No sculpting required. I bought the led lamp to cure it, this is definitely a great investment :)</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  You definitely need the base becuase I tried it without and my nails looked awful.  It&#x27;s worth the extra cash to have shiny, smooth nails!</li>
    <li> When I buy nail polish I usually get OPI because they are usually better quality. I just started getting all my Gel Nail stuff and this product was awesome! So much cheaper than OPI and better quality!</li>
    <li> I agree with the last reviewer Kart, this base moves towards the center while leaving edges blank and uneven. A second base coat is needed to correct the issue, and even then you will need to apply it fast because you will keep having the same problem. Second issue with this product I keep having is that, it&#x27;s not lasting more than 4 days. The whole thing  lifts and comes off entirely in one piece without having to use any remover whatsoever. This is definitely not an original but fake gelish base. Very dissapointed at how such products are allowed to be sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love to do my nails and have them look nice.  My husband teases me that it&#x27;s one of only two things I am particularly &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; about.  I find gels to be the best option for me as they cure fast and do not have long dry times and stay nice longer and make my nails a bit stronger so they break less easily.  However gels just do NOT stick to my nails.  I have tried several brands (Orly, OPI, and CND) and all of them just peel off.  Orly is the biggest offender and rarely lasts more than 12 hours, CND does passably well and will last a few days but once there is the slightest parting between nail and polish they come off, often in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish actually stays on.  I can still get it to peel but it takes considerable effort (I tried just to see how well it would actually hold).  Of all the gel bases out there, it definitely stays on the longest.  It also comes in a very large bottle (others have mentioned this), about twice as much as the CND base and maybe 4 times as much as the Orly, so lasts a long time.  It smells terrible though, very pungent.</li>
    <li> This foundation Gel is great! Make sure you apply it very thin! It works in conjunction with the Gelish Gel Polishes as well as a few other brands that I have tried.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moXPY41T6P8LJ6]]My wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find.  She looked at the local beauty supply houses and found that the prices they charged for Gelish was high and that the bottles were very small.  They were also almost always out of stock on the more popular colors.  Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is a good example.  It is the base coat that you put onto your nail and cure before you apply your favorite color of nail polish.  It creates a tacky base that helps to bond the polish to your nails and it increases the life of your nail polish job to the 2 week period that you would expect.  When applying it put it on in a medium to a thin coat and don&#x27;t forget to do the front edge of your nail as that is where pealing can start.  You always have to cure the foundation coat in your UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been doing her nails with Gelish for over 2 years and she loves it.  She has also done the nails for family and friends and helped them get started.  She always recommends that they buy their supplies on Amazon because of the selection, the lower price and the size of the bottles.  This bottle is 15 mL.  The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost 50% more when they are on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written multiple reviews on UV nail curing machine and here are the steps and curing times for a UV LED machine for your information.  Please note that curing times can vary a lot depending on the type of UV lamp you are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple instructions to use nail polish gels in a LED curing lamp:&lt;br /&gt;* Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;* Shape the nail using a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.

    <li> Good foundation/base coat for at-home gel nails.  I use this weekly for my diy gel manicures, and it is a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Love Gelish products - easy to apply and the last very well.</li>
    <li> This base coat does not allow the gel polish to adhere to nail. When I paint the gel on, it stays on towards the center of the nail, but the polish on the edges seeps in towards the middle. I know its not the Gelish brand polish because when i used the sally hansen base coat, it did not do this. My nails look terrible when I use this. Waste of time. Do not recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and true to the description. Would definitely recommend this product! Easy to use and really does last for a few weeks!</li>
    <li> product easy to use, brush inside bottle was a little stiff...brush needs reworking to make product flow properly. Am using</li>
    <li> Works well with gelish polish and regular nail polish</li>
    <li> The item was a great price and came promptly. Very pleased with the product and would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works better for me than any other brand.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect, I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  I&#x27;ve always like using Gelish brand.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product. It is a much bigger bottle than the ones offered at the beauty stores.Much better price too. I love it , I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and everyone complements my nails. Awesome product! Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> great value for such a big bottle. makes the top gel last much longer. love it! a must have for any gel nails!</li>
    <li> Product helps to make my manicure last nearly two weeks!  Great value! Combined with gel polish and top coat, my polish never chips!</li>
    <li> Good price on a great product. I use this every time I do a manicure. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Some say to just put it on the edges. I prefer to put a very thin &amp; sparing application over the whole nail while being meticulous on the edges. Reason is, I usually file down my nails as the weeks pass so I can preserve the look till the next fill or nail set. I think Gelish did a great job with its brush too; it&#x27;s short, stiff and perfect to apply the gel.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how large this bottle is for the price and free shipping. I totally recommend this to any women who uses this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Love Gelish polish!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done my own gelish manicures for about a year. I&#x27;ve tried all the short cuts such as using rubbing alcohol instead of primer, pure acetone rather than \\&quot;gel cleanser\\&quot;, all have worked great but you cannot get the same effect without the foundation. Also the shorter brush helps achieve a smoother, more even base coat.</li>
    <li> Works well with the Gelish line and the OPI gel polishes. My cap gets a little loose sometimes when the gel gets into the grooves.. just clean with acetone and the cap should stay on just fine.</li>
    <li> This gelish are very expensive but this one was at the price of the small bottle but to my surprise, it was a big bottle when I got it.  I am very pleased with my product.</li>
    <li> I like Gelish Nail polish. This is a good price and I will buy again when I run out of it.</li>
    <li> good deal for this in beauty stores its 25.00</li>
    <li> Love it! I combine it with acrylic powder what makes my nails harder. Remember you do need a UV lamp for it. I thought I didn&#x27;t and I ordered a lamp a few days after.</li>
