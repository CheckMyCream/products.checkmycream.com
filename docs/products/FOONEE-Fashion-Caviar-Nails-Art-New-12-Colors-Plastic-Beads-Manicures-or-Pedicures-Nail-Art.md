<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What the hell. This is not caviar this is not even glitter it is just sparkling dust. I cannot use this good thing I only paid $2.76. Would&#x27;ve gave 0 stars but I could not write a review without one.</li>
    <li> Wasnt the best. When I received this, there were 4 broken ones. And glitter everywhere. It was a mess. Besides that they were okkay.</li>
    <li> Good product..i think it came on time. It works well. One problem though..the seller didnt ensure that the little jars were tightly closed and as a result some of the glitters made a big mess. its a good product...i made use of the escaped glitter.</li>
    <li> This item was smaller than I expected and the glitter was larger than I had expected. I will know now to see if the descriptions will describe the item clearly before ordering.</li>
    <li> The glitter is very pretty and came before the delivery date but when I opened the package, many of the containers were not tightly sealed and therefore spilled all over inside the package.</li>
    <li> I love this glitter, it is very fine and powdery. I not only use it for my nails but also for crafts and scrap booking.</li>
    <li> I just received mine in the mail a little bit more than a week early, it looks just like the picture. It is glitter and I have all the colors I wanted, they r all different. I just did a set of nails for a family member and she loves them. Any one saying they r little rocks or something probably didn&#x27;t order this product LOL I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This was a great product! I used it right away and my nails came out just like they did at the salon!</li>
    <li> I love glitter, especially this little kit of glitter. I take with me when go to get my nails done. My nail technician loves kit. I am the envy of all the ladies where I get my nails done. I always take pictures of my completed nails so we can remember how they were done. I&#x27;m just a bling,bling girl.</li>
    <li> very tiny but pretty. probably wont order this again, but a great first timer starter or student would benefit. ;)</li>
    <li> THIS GLITTER MAKES MY DAUGHTERS NAILS LOOK AMAZING, GREAT FOR DOING ART ON NAILS. TRULY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT PRODUCT TO NAIL ENTHUSIASTS.</li>
    <li> Excellent, beautiful for the price!,quantity, is great small containers are easy for storage, received right away, very happy with this order</li>
    <li> Great colors to mix when making my own colored acrylics</li>
    <li> Excellent, item as described.</li>
    <li> These glitters are a nice variety if u don&#x27;t want to go to the arts and crafts store and buy a lot of solid colors I like them because its like a glitter sampler for you nails so I will give it thumps up</li>
    <li> The nail powder is fantastic, looks awesome on designs. Would most definetly  buy again, and recommend it to my family and friends. Great product 4.5 stars</li>
    <li> wish there was an easier way to put them onto the nail. this powder is the really thin powder that sticks to everything to you can just take a pinch and sprinkle onto your nail. if you do it wont come off your finger.</li>
    <li> Glitter can give really cool effects to nail designs it just makes a mess when you have the dust raw.</li>
    <li> it came just as it looked on the picture.  the box was a little weathered but the product was ok</li>
    <li> I know it was a great deal for this product but I  know why now one color will barely do one nail .</li>
    <li> I love these glitters and for the price I think they&#x27;re great. They are really vibrant colors and the glitters are just small enough to use for eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> i love the product cant wait to use it with my gel nails. thank you the product was fine grain like I like them</li>
    <li> Glitter! Goes well on everything &#x3D;] Except maybe in your eye... Anyways, these glitters were nice to use on the nails... Just takes forever to get the glitter off!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price for glitter--- you can&#x27;t find it any cheaper. It&#x27;s not really as bright and vivid as pictured, but it still serves its purpose. They are small containers, I used them w/ nail polish.</li>
    <li> I loved that I was able to add that sparkle in 3D effect that the polishes just weren&#x27;t giving me. I have bragged about this item and have absolutely recommended it to my friends! I will be purchasing more in the near future.</li>
    <li> The powder is not as full as the picture showed. Also, it is all stuck to the sides, and the top and everything. It sticks to EVERYTHING and its just not very good. :(</li>
    <li> There was much less then I thought there would be, the containers are tiny and not even half full unfortunately.</li>
    <li> got 3 pinks and 2 shades of orange. contact seller but haven&#x27;t heard back yet. jars are pretty small too. all 12, when taken out of the paper container, can fit in my hand.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I got mainly blue and green, with 2 oranges, 2 pinks, and 1 red and 1 purple. The colors were beautiful, and I loved them. However, I would have liked to get that pink one that is in the picture. The containers are shipped to you in a plastic bag, and the caps are not screwed on very well. I was lucky enough to have all of my caps on at least. The containers are about an inch in diameter, and 3 centimeters tall, with it being only half full. There is loose glitter in the bag, so I would recommend that you put the glitters down on a wet paper towel, so that the glitter doesn&#x27;t get everywhere. Overall, I would probably buy it again, coming from a 14 year old.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this but when I got it I received no black or glitters! I got like 4 different types of pink and none of the colors that I really wanted.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fun, and beautiful glitter. So easy to use, and the glitter color dosent wear off after applying top coat. Could possibly use it with acrylic powder.</li>
    <li> Got here a month late and didn&#x27;t have much glitter in the jars otherwise good.</li>
    <li> Im impressed&lt;br /&gt;The Product came early. Very Greatt varity of colors. Very excited to start using this on my nails.</li>
    <li> pretty colors...just very small canisters.only enough for two sets of nails each color.like i said, pretty colors.only  you get what you pay for..(very little).</li>
    <li> I love GLITTER! This is a great buy for nail art. I got what I ordered in the amount of time they estimated.</li>
    <li> Works great! I wanted just a plain gold nail for my ring fingers  so I painted on a clear coat then dipped my finger in the pot then i brushed off the excess glitter and applied a clear coat. I got a lot of compliments on my nails after I had done that. So glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Liked uses for this...like the vivid colors...used it for other artistic applications.  It was a little challenging when using intricate designs.</li>
    <li> This is the right size for me, new to doing my nails, nice colors, get way to practice on your nails.</li>
    <li> My kids love different ways to do there nails and these are really fun. We really enjoy the glitter and shine.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  You can really save money by doing your own nails and they will look very professional.  The dust stay on your nails and last a very long time.  I love the variety of colors.  I would recommend all ladies to purchase this item.  It may take a while to arrive, but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Huge mess containers break very easily.</li>
    <li> What I got didn&#x27;t look anything like the images on here. They were alot of the same colors, The little container they came in was under half way full and some colors had different colors mixed in them. I was disappointed in this as soon as I opened the package and seen how small and how big of a mess the bag was. I will go to wal-mart or a local store next time and not Waite 2-3 weeks for some glitter that isn&#x27;t worth $0.01</li>
    <li> This is a lot of fun for my kids. They love having sparkly nails. All of the different colors are great</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to your nail art supplies, they give you lots of colors and the price is great.</li>
    <li> the bad thing about these is the fact that some of the glitter pouches have big chunks and its not smooth enough and it gets clumpy but some of the are cute and smooth</li>
    <li> these sucked so bad ... or maybe i dont know how to use them but i honestly did not like this product</li>
    <li> I received my shipment way sooner than they said I would. The quality of this stuff is just fine. No different than the expensive stuff. The price is just unheard of. I will definitely be checking out this site again.</li>
    <li> I did not get what i pay for and it sucks. I got caviar beads, and at that they werent filled, which i HATE.</li>
    <li> I got sent a completly different item, emailed them and got a reponse right away and my correct item would be sent to me, however it took a bit of time since it was from overseas. Over all I love the glitter and appreciate the quick correction of my order and prompt communication with me as well.</li>
    <li> I thought it would come with some instructions on how it apply it but it only comes with the product.  Hopefully I can find something on YouTube</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the very pretty and tidy looking picture in the ad...that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;ll receive! I got a clear plastic bag full of the 12 little plastic pots that were covered with glitter. It looked like a fairy exploded inside the bags...but not one of the pots were open or broken, so they were packed that way. If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough some of the pots aren&#x27;t even a quarter of the way full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 12 pack I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 golds&lt;br /&gt;1 red&lt;br /&gt;1 dark pink&lt;br /&gt;1 light pink&lt;br /&gt;2 blues&lt;br /&gt;3 blacks&lt;br /&gt;1 silver&lt;br /&gt;1 green gold color...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like the pretty colors you see in their photo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T DO IT!! EVEN FOR THE PRICE...NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> These glitters just add even more fun and creativity to doing Nail Art.  Love the colors!  Though I figured out how to use them via You Tube it would have been nice if instructions were included.</li>
    <li> The glitters a really awesome The glitter are so awesome the work with A lot of people she get the glitter</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t come in one all together set. The box contains all the little jars separately. So in order to keep them neat they gotta stay in the original card box.</li>
    <li> the containers arrived loosely opened, inconsistently not filled properly, &amp; I had glitter all over I had to clean up after I opened the package. I was not happy about that. the colors are pretty &amp; look fun to use. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be Abe to use a color more than 1-2 Times. even that will depended on the color I choose bc many colors don&#x27;t  have very much product bc of spillage, lack of quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered similar product which will receive the same review bc of the sad same problem. I won&#x27;t buy either product again or anything from their companies.</li>
    <li> First time use and it works wonderful, I know where to go to get more!  I pass the word on to others as to where to go for their nail supplies.</li>
    <li> I like doing my own designs. And this product compares very well with other products I have, that are more expensive.  I like the variety of colors and that is very thin powder.</li>
    <li> when i bought these I was thinking &amp;#34;I just scored a major deal!&amp;#34; but upon arrival they were a bit of a let down. the jars are half full if that, and very small. the colors said 12 colors but its was more like 3 shades of very close blue or 2 identical pinks. The product it self works nicely</li>
    <li> very happy with my order, wonderful! I used it already to I love it. Will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the glitter that is shown or described. I received the long thin confetti like glitter and I am not happy with it at all.</li>
    <li> Works great, but can be a little messy</li>
    <li> I use these for nail art and they work great :) The jars are a lot smaller than what I assumed but since it was pretty cheap I can always order some more. It was delivered to me a week early which is a plus but it did have some glitter on the inside of the envelope it was mailed in and the box containing the glitter. That&#x27;s the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5. I would definitely recommend the product and the seller though (Onlinetrading).</li>
    <li> When you have girls to entertain, doing nails is a great activity.  My two daughters and I ejoy doing our nails.  This nail art powder/dust is great.  It comes in small containers and does not spill.  The glitter can be a bit messy to apply, but with some practice we learned not to waste too much.  Kids absolutely love using any nail art, and this one is great!</li>
    <li> the size is not what it looks.. its super small with almost no glitter never again will i order from this seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I actually use the glitter on eyes and face. Of course, you have to be careful not to get it in your eyes but it&#x27;s so inexpensive and works just as well as top makeup brand glitters.</li>
    <li> They are pretty colors but the containers leak out pretty bad. A little plastic wrap between the bowl and the lid should fix that problem though.</li>
    <li> Expected more glitter it was small amounts. The some glitter were the almost the same color n some spilled. I suggest to fill up the glitter containers more.</li>
    <li> These items arrived quickly and are very pretty in the jar.  They do adhere to the polish well if you use it properly.  Unfortunately, the packaging is terrible.  When I received mine, most of the gold, green and blue was spilled in the container.  The lids are not taped or anything to keep them in place and prevent the glitter from leaking everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the packaging.  However, the sparkle is pretty and the glitter is fine/dust-like with plenty color.  Covering this with a clear coat works fine but I would recommend using one that you&#x27;ve set aside especially for glitter designs.  It will come off on the brush a little and get into your clear coat.</li>
    <li> This product does not come in the container shown.  Theyre all placed in a baggie together and the containers are not filled as shown in the pic.  Feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> So excited when I found this. I have been looking for a fine nail glitter for a while and thought this would be a hit. Although the glitter is nice one container was unscrewed and compltly emptyed into the envelope and all the others were half or less full.. I feel like the I was ripped off even though I only spent less then 3 dollars.  This product is clearly a dud.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and it&#x27;s not even glitter, dust, or glitter dust. It was little balls. The only thing I recieved that was actually advertised was 12 colors. I guess it&#x27;s true when they say you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this, She is a nail technician and this item was ordered with others to complete her collection of nail supplies</li>
    <li> It took about 3 weeks to get my product but when I got my glitter powder I was satified it was properly in place and the bottles was very full.I purshase my product from nails gaga they are the best.I will be ordering some more of there products.</li>
    <li> The glitter came very well and all the colors were right in the picture. I think it&#x27;s a matter of luck if you get all different colors or if the lids are sealed properly because reading the other reviews I was worried how it was going to come out! But it came out great :)</li>
    <li> Packaging is a bit messy but they do seal up nicely, so even though the box is a little messy the glitter doesn&#x27;t spread all over my drawers or cause a mess. Easy to use and lots of fun colors.</li>
    <li> When i ordered these glitters, i expected certain things, but what i certainly didn&#x27;t expect was for all of my glitters to only be half full. I was very upset.</li>
    <li> Used it onces. Its ok, it gave the nail design a different look. Now there are nail polishes with glitter included so i use it very little.</li>
    <li> This was really nice. I received 0 duplicates and none of the colors had spilled. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great pack.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The order came quickly (within 2 weeks) and was just what I expected.  I love adding the glitter to my nails.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order more.</li>
    <li> The glitter was beautiful but when I received it in the mail some containers were open so that was a bit of a disappointment, but the ones that survived were great!</li>
    <li> Very happy came way sooner then it was showing i did get two blues but thats ok cant have to many of one color one of the jars was almost all the way open but i would order again :)</li>
    <li> I  ordered this product because I loved the glitter colors pictured. But after a long shipping time my glitter selection was different. As far as quality goes, ehh.. No 2 jars are as full as the others. My collection was full of neon colors but unfortunately when I use them in my nail art as I intended, most of the colors have zero saturation and don&#x27;t show up as neon, more pastel. I will use them in scrapbooking instead. They set was cheap enough that I never considered sending them back but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again. Instead I have saved my money and bought some Martha Stewart glitter sets and I cant say enough good things about her collections. If your looking for glitter for ANY reason I would strongly suggest you buy Martha Stewart instead.</li>
    <li> I will be doing my great grand daughters nail and mine. We will have fun. Thanks for the great items.</li>
    <li> I love how this glitter is not like every other glitter. The crystals are bigger and looks amazing on my nails. I like that this glitter product is above the norm. I am very pleased with this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This is really nice and sheep product I really love it I never expect that much for the price.....cool deal</li>
    <li> all i can say isdont buy this product it sucks its just a waste&lt;br /&gt;u cant even use it&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried to give it another use because as a nail product it doesnt work</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. The product is cheap and when i received it the glitter was spilled every where. There was barely anything inside the containers that were not open.</li>
    <li> Colors are a bit brighter than in the picture but i liked them more.. very cute and very happy with my purchase. took a little long to get to me but came before delivery date:)</li>
    <li> I love these sparkles!!! they came way earlier than expected. My advice is to put a coat of regular colored nail polish on first, than put a clear coat and follow with the same color of sparkle as nail polish. It looks much better!! i attached these with a clear coat and wait for them to dry then brushed off excess. I strongly advize to do OUTSIDE</li>
    <li> Just received can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
    <li> Just came today not the same colors as the picture but I guess that&#x27;s fine I got 4 different green and 2 purple pretty much the same looking colors can&#x27;t really good tell them apart except the blue white and pink everything else looks pretty much the same but it is glitter dust.</li>
    <li> takes for ever to get, this is a low quality glitter but still serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> one was broken when it came but they are still nice</li>
    <li> Unpleased with colors recieved. Not whats on the photo, repeated colors and not every photo. They could put every color displayed</li>
    <li> Came right on time and i really like the colors it came with. they have white,red, gold, green, dark pink, pink, green, blue, like a magenta color, purple, and black? theres 12 colors in total. but i would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> These are exactly what you could expect for a low price! Not bad, but not as much as I would&#x27;ve hoped for either. Although, it did come pretty fast. Less than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This glitter is amazing for nails and if you buy body glue and stencils it is awesome for tattoos!!! It shipped fast like before it said it was coming! If you love glitter buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> Love this ! I look like i went to a salon! when i did them myself and saved money!! Love it !</li>
    <li> Expect to use a lot of one of these</li>
    <li> I just ordered this...it was less than $3.00!! Beggers can&#x27;t be choosers! It baffles me...all these complaints....you get what you pay for people...it was THREE DOLLARS.&lt;br /&gt;From all the mixed reviews...I could care less all the crappy stuff folks have said about the containers only being half full blah blah blah...$2.74...I just hope it arrives before next Thursday!!</li>
    <li> Love the powder  and the glitter is very bright and shiny the glitter is very strong and the color does not come off with use of acrylic</li>
    <li> i use it with gel and it works great. price is great cant get any better than that . .</li>
    <li> Great sparkles, smaller then I thought but looks great on nails. Very happy with my purchase. : ) thank u</li>
    <li> Very small containers. Smaller than a quarter. The lid wasn&#x27;t sealed on the black and pink glitter so I didn&#x27;t get much of those colors. No duplicate colors. Would buy again if improved</li>
    <li> I love it and so easy to use and fun way to create different looks for your nail.  I like the fact I can do it at home and not have to pay the price of the beauty shop.  And my nieces loved them.</li>
    <li> Received the fine glitter, not the same colors as shown but that&#x27;s what description said. Ever buy a bag of chips and the bag barely has anything?  That&#x27;s how I felt.  Only two out of the twelve containers had a decent amount in them.  If you turn the little containers on its side, they were a little passed half.  Four of them were about half full. Five were 1/3 full.  And the color that I loved the most was only 1/5 full.</li>
    <li> You have to be very careful! The glitter is fine so breathing too hard will send little specks flying through the air. first time I used this it looked like a fairy threw up on me. My nails looked great though.</li>
    <li> I love this. I was wrong.  I did receive this. I&#x27;m sorry as I looked and found I did get this. Please forgive me. I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed doing things with my kids so this one it&#x27;s a great one for nails all for something else they&#x27;re really nice and cheap !</li>
    <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
    <li> I buy on line to safe time, but this was a great item. My daughter has fun creating nail art on herself. She loved it</li>
    <li> Love it on my nails. Easy to use with a brush. Love the colors also. Will buy it again soon</li>
    <li> As a MUA, I can use loose glitter like this for face and nails. It&#x27;s very fine glitter and It has intense color. I love it and need more!</li>
    <li> Bad package one of the colors was open and the glitter Fell inside the box the colors were pretty .</li>
    <li> Its just as described!  Great value and great product!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy more again when i need more :) love it</li>
    <li> They stated i had a choice of 12 or 24 colors of this glitter \\&quot;dust\\&quot;.  What i got was six colors, they just sent two of each of the same colors.  And if this is what they think is dust for nail art, they are deluding themselves.  The only thing this stuff is good for is if i want to make some poster boards not nail art.  They may think its ok to lie since it&#x27;s so cheap, but that was my hard earned money they stole from me and anyone else who falls for their lies......UPDATE, the seller contacted me and apologized and refunded my money shipping included.  This definately changes my opinion on the seller but not the product.</li>
    <li> But... Colors shown are not what you receive. You get the correct number of colors, but there is not a huge variety of colors, many duplicates. For the price its not terrible though.</li>
    <li> I love this glitter, I have ordered more than once from this company and it is exactly what I thought it would be, when I run out I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Ordered caviar beads and got crappy glitter instead. Complete waste of money. Do not recommend. One star only since I couldn&#x27;t leave no stars.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just received these today. They look very pretty, but I received two blacks. When I opened the package the glitter containers were in a plastic baggie. When I opened the baggie there was glitter everywhere, like one of the containers had opened. There were 3 different purples which is ok since that&#x27;s my sister in laws favorite color.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to use this</li>
    <li> Its messy I dont like it&lt;br /&gt;you open it and it all falls&lt;br /&gt;i had to throw it away&lt;br /&gt;not happy</li>
    <li> Order this and the colors aren&#x27;t nice as it looks online. Also there isn&#x27;t enough glitter in these little jars. I wouldn&#x27;t even waist time buying this when you can actually get the same glitter at the dollar store bigger. Should&#x27;ve think about it before I bought it.</li>
    <li> The packaging was not very good. seal the lids tighter. had a lot of spills in the bag and currently have no gold or pink glitter from the spills. but very good.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I go to the manicurist, sometimes I don&#x27;t. When I went yesterday to the manicurist, I bought this glitter set with me and was really impressed with how my nails looked, the usual nail polish with a slight shimmer... I gave this item a 4 star because it came later than i hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Quality dust glitter sparkle for nail decoration. I have found different ways to use the dust glitter for nail art including tattoos. The dust glitter is easy to use. I would use this company again.</li>
    <li> Very nice glitter dust, beautiful colors and works great! BUT... I did NOT get the colors shown, Still seems ok though. Great item for newbies to nail art but don&#x27;t get the best results. This is more like very small glitter pieces instead of a dust or powder as it sounds but still is great! I used clear coat where i wanted it and applied it with a small dry paint brush or if i just did the tip, i stuck my nail into the container right to the clear coat line. Then i used the dry paintbrush to lightly tap the glitter down &amp; set it into the clear coat. After letting it dry a bit i finished off with a top coat of clear coat across entire nail and glittered part. It looks like there are multiple Gold colors but they are all different. One is Gold, one gold with a hint of pink and one gold with a bit of silver or clear. Colors are so bright and eye catching! I suggest opening over something like the outside of a closed Zip-lock baggie and once open taking a dry small paintbrush and cleaning off glitter caught in screw on ridges. The plastic baggie is perfect for folding in half and tapping extra glitter back into container and it slides easily. I got the remaining pieces by wetting end of brush and rolling it into the glitter then tapping brush out over container. GREAT ITEM! I just love the way it looks on my nails!</li>
    <li> Very very thin. Plan on using the same color nail polish under the glitter to even be able to see it well.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and beautiful.  Very easy to apply.  Many different looks.  This was my first time ordering this product and I was very pleased and not nearly as messy as I thought. And I can be really messy if not careful.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars was you have to put a thick layer of topcoat on or glitter will wear off easily.  Otherwise a great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> When you open it even if there&#x27;s no wind or anything it still goes everywhere so you need to have a designated area to do this in.  It&#x27;s just glitter in a jar.  Super fine glitter in a jar.  Goes on thick since it&#x27;s so fine.  Not really any way to get a small amount since it static-clings together.  The best part is that it comes in 12 different colors to match any nail art decoration you are doing.  Very good, but very messy.</li>
    <li> Better then what i Expected.</li>
    <li> Again, fun and easy to use.  The colors are bright and give a lot of sparkle.  Made my nails fun!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas and I know she is going to really enjoy doing her nails with this glitter!</li>
    <li> First let me say you get what you pay for. They arrived earlier than i expected. I got two red, three gold, a dark blue, a turquoise,  a black, a silver, a green, and two light purples. I thought i would get twelve different colors but no.</li>
    <li> love this great love the colors</li>
    <li> I finally got my package and was excited, the I saw these little tiny tubes with LESS then half full glitter. Its enough in the tube to maybe do 4 fingers. One top of that 3 of the colors ate the same. But hey 2.49 what can you expect</li>
    <li> It is really easy to use. And I love the colors. I will be ordering more once I need it.</li>
    <li> The little packages of glitter are just that---little. There isn&#x27;t much glitter in them at all. Not recommended. I would keep looking plus it takes forever to come in.</li>
    <li> This stuff is SO great. I apply it with my finger to a slightly wet nail and the look is amazing.  Glitter...bonanza...</li>
    <li> EWW..I was totally displeased with this product..Though the price is cheap but it doesn&#x27;t deserve even few dollars. I recommend you not to buy this..</li>
    <li> I expected more colors as in the picture shows and the plastic part to hold them but instead I received 2 bags with 6 containers in each.&lt;br /&gt;I received...&lt;br /&gt;4-yellow&lt;br /&gt;2-purple&lt;br /&gt;1-dark purple&lt;br /&gt;1-dark orange&lt;br /&gt;1-blue&lt;br /&gt;1-red&lt;br /&gt;1-black&lt;br /&gt;1-dark pink&lt;br /&gt;They work well but the glitter only comes half full.</li>
    <li> I REALLY WANTED THE SILVER GLITTER BUT I DID NOT RECEIVE IT, ALSO THE CONTAINERS ARE REALLY SMALL. OTHER THAN THAT I LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for someone who is just starting to do their own nails. Good color variety, and my daughter&#x27;s love adding glitter accents to their nails</li>
    <li> This is a small amount of each color, but if you&#x27;re using a small nail fan-style nail brush and applying to tips, it&#x27;s going to last quite awhile!  I received 3 jars of gold, but a variety of colors for the rest, including a silver, red, green, blue, etc.  I&#x27;m okay with extra gold because I was wanting this color anyway!  The small jars, about the size of a quarter and 1/4&amp;#34; deep, will be useful to reuse later too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend who likes to do nails, and she loves it! Perfect!</li>
    <li> they are perfect!! they are so shiny and they are really pretty on the nail! i am really happy with my purchase, alsoat prices!!!</li>
    <li> The product is very nice.  Great color and is dust like.  Works very well.  We e-mailed inquiring about the product and how soon it would come.  We received a reply within 24 hrs and a promise of a little gift as well.  The product came when promised and there was a Mercedes key chain ;-)</li>
    <li> I just get mine and there is nothing in them just emuoh to look like they have in them but no there is nothing!  I read other comments &amp; they all say the same thing SO SAVE YOUR MONEY !</li>
    <li> youre better off buying so glitter at a craft store. they are small pots, they took a looong time to get here</li>
    <li> I was very hype and excited when i seen this item on amazon because i couldnt find it anywhere. I brought some silver glitter from Avon that was so nice and sparkly that i had to have more but of course they only had one color silver. So when i found these on here i was happy plus they are a very good price. I recieve the package 4 days before the date they said it would ship witch was a good thing. But when i open the package i couldnt believe my eyes. It was not glitter at all it was kinda like little rocks. Not what i expected at all the colors are very pretty but its not glitter is little crushed up something :( of course i tryed it out on my sis and she like it but you have to use so much because the pieaces are pretty big. and also the case it comes in is very small so its not that much maybe one or two maini per color and thats only if you doing it on one finger because you def cant get the gillter well rocks lol on all 5 fingers.</li>
    <li> good for the price and very cute colors. great price</li>
    <li> I bought this item for nail art. It&#x27;s very messy and really fine specs of glitter. Looks nice on the nails, but is very messy. I wont use it very often.</li>
    <li> i use with my makeup for added effect</li>
    <li> love love love these. If you have a uv lamp for gel nails or just use with normal nail polish they sparkle awesome. ill be a long term customer. customer service was great when i thought they got lost in the mail.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than what they look like inew the picture and some werenot even full</li>
    <li> I love this but I love nail art things and this was just what we needed. My girls used it and it works well.</li>
    <li> These glitters are super awesome and so easy to use, i love them and would recommend anyone to get them</li>
    <li> This is ok ,it get mess but I still like it my sister like it too she wll be ordering too ((thank u))</li>
    <li> this &amp;#34;nail art powder &amp;#34; is not powder it is big huge chunks of glitter and i hate it so much</li>
    <li> This set of sparkle glitter is so pretty and the colors are perfect. I like that its more powdery than a glitter.  A great value!</li>
    <li> the colors are vibrant and bright. they came in a nice little package. it did take some time dor tuem to come in ma, but i wasn&#x27;t in a hurry- if you are, consider your nearest craft store or nail supply store.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because it creates beautiful  luster on the nail and a whole new look. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. the only thing about it I didn&#x27;t like was not all the containers had the same amount in them. and the amount was smaller then I anticipated. but overall great!</li>
    <li> I thought they were bigger :-) but I still i can use them next time I&#x27;ll look for something different</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not a powder though.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> Ok I gave this 4 stars because I love them and the price but a couple of the caps weren&#x27;t on quite tight enough and during the shipping process glitter spilled all over inside the plastic case holding them!!  I still can&#x27;t get all the glitter cleaned out of there! :-P</li>
    <li> Ordered caviar received bad glitters not recommand</li>
    <li> i can do the nail by my self</li>
    <li> This is hard to apply even if using a brush (which had to be purchased separately) Little holes in the lid would make it easier to shake some out onto the nails after they are polished.</li>
    <li> This nail glitter is pretty. I love the way the gold shimmers. This would be great colors with UV acrylic nails &amp; the  colors are brilliant.</li>
    <li> to the point of being very hard to get to  without it spreading all over.  It was a mess on delivery - the lids on several of them were loose so glitter inside and out.  Company should tape around the edge of the lid to keep it from coming loose during shipping.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for this set - the colors are vibrant but also so fine that just shaking it around a little causes static - can&#x27;t even open the lid without it making a sparkly mess.</li>
    <li> Love the glitter. It could be a little bigger. None of them were spilled or opened. cant wait to try them all.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;12 Colors Nail Art Powder Dust Glitter Sparkle Nail Tip Decoration&amp;#34; is ok.  Very small amounts of each powder.  It took a few weeks to receive (within the shipping estimate) and the packaging was bad enough that some of the powders leaked into the shipping package.</li>
    <li> This product is not as described....It is NOT &#x27;Glitter,Powder or Dust&#x27; as it states...It is a chunky, low sparkle thick flake like material....Very disappointed....If I could post a photo I would.....This would be a great product if this was the type of thing I was looking for....But I was looking for a DUST GLITTER POWDER......OH and the colors are great if your looking for a chunky, odd and uneven textures of different sizes and shapes....no to chunks are the same size or shape....</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs some special colors for a fun occasion. They are small so there is not a lot of each color but the variety is fun</li>
    <li> the colors are amazing but the containers are super small in the picture its larger than what they really are.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors..met my expectations :) very pleased</li>
    <li> I mix this with my acrylic powder. Love it</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations!! Very Sparkly!!</li>
    <li> Came two weeks before the expected date!!!! I have to try it out but the color selection is very nice. however, the glitter is not a powdered pigment but more like plastic glitters. But for the nails is good enough.</li>
    <li> I received this item around the time of the expected shipping date. It did take a while but I felt it would be worth it, it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered these glitters I thought the colors would be dark &amp; vibrant, &amp; that the size would at least be decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitters came in light shaded colors, some that aren&#x27;t even shown. I got a dark green &amp; a dark purple that isn&#x27;t shown, I love those but would have loved to get a dark blue as well. Another thing I was disappointed about was the SMALL sizes of the containers! They are so tiny your nail barely fits in it. There is no way you would be able to do all ten nails with the same color glitter. I guess they&#x27;re good for accent nails though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I can&#x27;t really complain. But you&#x27;re better off going to your nearest dollar store or wal mart &amp; buying tubes of glitter there. At least those will last you a good while.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great shape</li>
    <li> Cheap cavier..hard to attach</li>
    <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
    <li> The glitter comes in 12 different color and is deff worth the money. I bought this because it was like 2$ and free shipping. Whhat i got was exactly what i paid for...the glitter comes in tiny jars enough for a one time use. Great product but wish it came in bigger jars. :D</li>
    <li> The colors are great but some of them are filled about 1/3 of the way and the less popular glitters are filled entirely hmmm i wonder why?! No but really if youre not running a salon its nice for tips :)</li>
    <li> Product are easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;Make my decoration even better,l&lt;br /&gt;I save lots of money with this&lt;br /&gt;5 stars ..thanks</li>
    <li> I liked it. You will get 12 little containers containing different colored glitter. It is just as described and pictured.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product itself is great, but the packaging could be better.  I loved the colors, but when I got them there was very little product, a lot of it had spilled.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking there would be a white shimmer included. It is not white, its silver. The containers are small, but the colors are good and vivid. My nail technician loved them as a gift.</li>
    <li> The glitter really stands out on your nails, some colors look the same but have slight difference in contrast. Despite the other reviews the glitter small and I think it it perfect for nails. I just love the way my nails sparkle in the light.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product! The first time you wash ur hands the glitter color comes off and all ur stuck with are remnants of colorless glitter and nails that look like they were done last week even tho u spent an hour doing them five mins b4!!! Not a good product! I do not recommend u waste ur money or time on this garbage.</li>
    <li> This is great for nails, the glitter is fine and does not make your nails rough because it is so fine!!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery!!! Best I have had coming from overseas. Ordered on April 18th and delivery was slated for May 12th and got it today, April 25th!!!! Very impressed...but with being said this is not what I ordered. I ordered glitter and what I got is a very fine powder substance resembling sticks. I wanted glitter!! No where in the description of this product does it says this is fine powder sticks!! Why? But you get what you pay for I guess. I mean I can use these BUT I WANTED GLITTER!!!</li>
    <li> my little girl loves me to put this on her nails. it is great quality and stays really well. got some duplicates of colors but they are still really pretty.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t brother buying this crap. U get 12 glitters in teeny tiny pots and the colors are all the same basically. I got 5 pots of an ugly orangish \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; and 4 pots of black, along with 3 pots of red, all the same red. Its crappy glitter on top of that. The pots were almost all empty, and had spilled out so the pots are about 1/8th full. All this after I CONTACTED THE SELLER FIRST TO BE SURE I WOULD GET 12 DIFFERENT COLORS AND TO MAKE SURE THEYD CLOSE THEM TIGHT AND FILL THEM COMPLETELY. This jerk emailed me back and promised Id get 12 DIFFERENT colors and she&#x27;d make sure they were full and tightly closed. I waited 2 months to get this dissapointing mess of a package. I wasted my $ and hope no one else bothers with this as u will surely be unhappy. Also the glitter is not even like glitter. Looks more like tiny pieces of matte paper. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time! !!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this glitter to use as eye shadow and it works very well it&#x27;s super fine and looks awesome on.</li>
    <li> First off the glitter arrived early.. unexpected bonus! Second it is 12 different colors no duplications! My glitter was \\&quot;normal\\&quot;  glitter ie the fine powder type.  I will buy again and often!  Packaging was great, no spilt glitter anywhere. I would give them a 10 if it was possible!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with the selection of colors and the price was more than reasonable.  It may take a little longer to receive your order but I learned this is an international seller.  Even with that it only took a couple of weeks to receive it.</li>
    <li> I would have paid more to have the containers a bit fuller, nice colors though, this is for my goddaughter that loves nail design</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I like it. I would definitely buy it again. Thank you so much :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but horrible packaging. I found literally every single container of glitter about halfway empty and spilled inside the packaging because each container was halfway opened. The amount of glitter each container holds is quite small to begin with so I only received a tiny amount. This could have easily been due to the rattling around during shipping(which was lengthy)or lack of care when packaging to begin with but if more care was taken in packaging this would not have happened</li>
    <li> I was expecting the case as well, the containers arrived all mixed up! But good product after all; I might order more pretty soon because some of them arrived almost empty.</li>
    <li> they came complete but it carris few powder</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars for the colors but they are tiny for $12 I felt it could&#x27;ve been more. They are like half an inch size.</li>
    <li> Some of the glitter cases were open when it arrived but other than that it was good. I would purchase again</li>
    <li> I received the glitter within the time frame givin. The problem with this order was the cases were not even half full. i expected so much more an got much less. Will not be buying from this seller again. Dont waste ur money</li>
    <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
    <li> I can hardly wait to use these on my nails. just waiting for my nails to grow a little longer so that they can be even more beautiful and glamorous.</li>
    <li> When I received the beads some of the containers where empty because the contents had spilled over into the other containers and had blended together. And I didn&#x27;t like the fact the items I ordered from this company came piece by piece.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the small plastic bead set and I was extremely disappointed with the product I received. The product that was delivered to me did not match the description at all. Instead of getting the plastic beads I was expecting, I got glitter.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you- do not trust the descriptions given, they are inaccurate.</li>
    <li> These were listed as &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34;, which typically means small round beads. The images also depict the standard caviar size and shape. What I received was glitter and I am quite displeased. Most of the containers are half empty and there are several repeat colors. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This glitter powder has worked out so well to supplement our glitter body art tattoo kit. We are loving the gorgeous colors and the price can&#x27;t be beat. One little container of this glitter was 2.98 plus tax at a local year-round costume shop. What&#x27;s not to love about the price? I hear it&#x27;s great for nails too.</li>
    <li> Love the colors.... received it before the actual date....can&#x27;t wait to start using it....getting my nail art things in check and organized its nice to b u y New things...</li>
    <li> I got and it  they look just as the are in The picture</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described. Works great on my nails. It is great to use to make nail designs. Great Product</li>
    <li> I got a variety of colors and I am very pleased with this product. None of my glitter was spilled and all the lids were in tightly. I will definitely purchase more of this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Received 12 containers but only 9 colors unlike the advertised 12, received three jars of the gold glitter... Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get all the colors as the picture.</li>
    <li> They are nice to use to accent  your chest</li>
    <li> I love glitter and theses colors are very pretty. This was a must have for my nail art collection. So shinny and sparkly.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the difference in amounts. One will be totally full but others halfway. It didn&#x27;t really matter for such a great price. Nice glitter. Stays on well with clear coat over it. Works great with a VERY slightly damp brush.</li>
    <li> they were a little smaller than I expected but then you don&#x27;t really need that much glitter for your designs. wonder colors and they go with almost any nail polish... loved the colors!</li>
    <li> There is some false advertisement here. I was to believe with was tiny glitter dust but it is not!! It is small pieces of sequins. It can work for your nails but I was disappointed cuz it&#x27;s not what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Definitely cute but the glitter chunks are too big for your nails</li>
    <li> I wasnt to impremessed with this item. They were very tiny and not connected as shown in the picture. None of the colors were the same as shown in the picture. I know its not your fault but some were damaged and broken could be put in more protective package.</li>
    <li> S beautiful! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my friend who is an upcoming nail technician. I was completely dissatisfied. First the glitter case were not properly secured so there was glitter all in the Ziploc bag they came in. And as a result I have 4 empty glitter containers. Also its not even 12 different colors I have 3 black. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they want a lot of black glitter 4 empty cases and a Ziploc bag filled with mixed glitter.</li>
    <li> Pretty and glitter is fine enough that it works great for nail art.  It comes in individual jars.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again or recommend anyone to buy this and the picture on here are none of the colors you received</li>
    <li> I am a do it yourself nail art girl, and depending on your level of expertise, it can get pricy so I am always looking for a good deal on quality products. When testing out first time used products it is easy to pick the wrong one and waste money but this glitter set is a great buy. I am very pleased with it and I plan to get the larger set with more colors. the glitter offers endless decorating combos and I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was not what i had bought. I wanted beads and they sent gliter waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I got these expecting very full pots of glitter and I didn&#x27;t even get half. The glitter was fine and it works but there needs to be more. And it doesn&#x27;t come in a container to hold the pots if you were hoping it did. It comes in a bag where the glitter tends to fall out of the pots due to a bad seal.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a good buy if you want lots of glitter with a lot of color options however I was disappointed  when they arrived because there were four not properly closed and the inside was filled with glitter so it was a mess. Aside from that they&#x27;re good and I may end up buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> There is hardly anything in here!!!</li>
    <li> There were four greens and three blues in that one little pallet of 12.  There were no vibrant colors as was advertised.  Very disappointed with that purchase.</li>
    <li> Although originally I thought the actual product was on the small size I figured I had gotten what I paid for... but to my surprise it&#x27;s actual glitter dust and I&#x27;ve so far achieved nothing but perfect gradients. Best part is they arrived 2 weeks early.</li>
    <li> You will need some great glue to do nail art with it. Normal nail polish doesnt do a good job. They are a bitch to take off. I guess that&#x27;s for any glitter+nail product tho.</li>
    <li> Arrived much sooner than anticipated arrival date. They are so much prettier than the ones at the local craft stores! Worth it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I thought I found what I was looking for to complete my manicure. I was looking for the finest dust of glitter to top the tips of my nails. The pic showed the description that I was looking for and the description sounded perfect. I even ordered 2 of the product cause it seemed absouloute perfect...........I anxiously awaited my shipment and when it came I was so shocked to see what I recieved!!! I had these flat little plastic circular cases that had hexagon glitterly confetti pieces in it, nowhere near what I expected. I am very unsatisfied with this purchase!!!!! This get ZERO stars!!!!!!!! BWA HAHA..........</li>
    <li> Its fine glitter powder! And i love the colors! The little jar containers are so cute! It comes with 12 jara with different colors!! You will be amaized!!! And its so cheap i will buy moreeeee!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used these for the glitter skin art re-stock.  The 7-year old granddaughters love them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage Daughter who loves to do different nail designs. She really likes it, plus the price was right.</li>
    <li> JUST RECIEVED MY PRODUCT..LOVE THE COLORS AND CUTE LITTLE CONTAIERS.. GREAT DEAL.WISH IT WOULD HAVE CAME WITH INSTRUCTIONS/SUGGESTIONS THOUGH..JUST A THOUGHT..BUT I LIKE IT..TY</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors I fell in love I use them always&lt;br /&gt;Came in clean and well done.in package&lt;br /&gt;Some glitter came out not much.</li>
    <li> I really hate thing DONT BUY THIS  It&#x27;s just the worst thing u can ever buy I waisted my money for this OMG I still can&#x27;t believe this</li>
    <li> i got glitter which is actually better anyways, eventhough the pic shows caviar.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to nails</li>
    <li> Great colors, and the texture is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Order was received as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying it very soon.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the estimated time. I love it. Stylish. Cute. &amp;Modern. All at a good price!!! A must have nail art product</li>
    <li> Not bad not great... Some glitter was faint and didn&#x27;t show up like I&#x27;d have liked. But over all the glitter was ok</li>
    <li> I love these glitters. They are so pretty and there were a lot of color options and its fun to mix them. Really convenient that they are in an acrylic case put they are all in separate jars.</li>
    <li> I do not know how to work with them, but my friend promised to come to my show, I really like the color. I will try tomorrow to do with them.</li>
    <li> no instructions on how to use at all.  no pictures.  just simple glitter.  will have to use on crafts instead of nails.  waste of $</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much as i thought and the containers are so small this product will be gone before you know it.</li>
    <li> I should have known better - you get what you pay for.  We threw it away by Christmas evening.  Did not work.</li>
    <li> They are just like any glitter, i like them for certian things but not nailart... unless your doing a whole nail...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite like the colors I got. And the glitter itself is too big. I thought it would be dust like but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
