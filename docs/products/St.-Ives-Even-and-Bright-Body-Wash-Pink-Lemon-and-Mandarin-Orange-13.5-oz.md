      <li>I Was Quite Impressed With How It Actually Brightened And Cleansed My Skin</li>
      <li>Most soaps don&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
      <li>This is ok but not a fragrance I would have deliberately purchased and not what I thought I was buying.  </li>
      <li>and I love St. Ives</li>
      <li>, what more could I ask for?</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Very fresh scent!</li>
      <li>Buy this if you love a strong citrus scent.</li>
      <li>It is really refreshing and slightly sweet.</li>
      <li>Creates a nice lather and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>This product has a refreshing aroma and lathers quickly and well.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while and works perfect!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic</li>
      <li>Great product I will purchase in the future!</li>
      <li>Love the smell and fresh feeling on this body soap.</li>
      <li>also that feels like a light sugar scrub.</li>
      <li>Energizing Citrus is fantastic smelling.</li>
      <li>I love just about anything from ST Ives, I have been using it since it was priced low to get popular.</li>
      <li>I, personally, love the smell, it certainly smells like oranges and grapefruits  </li>
      <li>What I got was Bright Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange.  </li>
      <li>The photo here is of Energizing Citrus, but the description is for Bright Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange Body wash.</li>
      <li>Fresh Zest, eye awakening every morning</li>
      <li>but I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
      <li>THAT IS NOT A PINK GRAPEFRUIT ON THE LABEL!  :-)  </li>
      <li>Love this shower gel---smells fresh and is just as great as the expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>I love many of the St Ives products but this one does not fit the bill for me.  </li>
      <li>First off, I don&#x27;t care for the scent -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been having this problem consistently ever since</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>I want to be able to use one body wash for my entire body.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty great made my wife&#x27;s dry sensitive skin evened out a little better</li>
      <li>I ordered the Energizing Citrus, only to get the Bright Pink lemon, which is not what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my daughter, who tends to be picky about fragrance, but really likes to use body wash.</li>
      <li>Nothing has ever really worked for my face but body wash cleaned it all up.</li>
      <li>Be sure to read the description carefully, I saw the picture that showed Energizing Citrus and bought it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks i like it</li>
      <li>it leaves your skin soft and clean and is such a treat for the senses!</li>
      <li>my skin is left super soft.</li>
      <li>This smells so natural!</li>
      <li>Now my younger daughter wants some, too!</li>
      <li>It Was Supposed To, And The Scent Completely Goes Away</li>
      <li>so if you want a lit of fragrance this gel won&#x27;t wow you.  </li>
      <li>Exfoliates and works well on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It might just be cause that area of my neck is really sensitive.</li>
      <li>It does not dry your skin out nor does it leave weird soapy residue/film.  :)</li>
      <li>Smells fine, but not great.  </li>

    <li> Nice smell and had pumice beads which I didn&#x27;t realize it had.</li>
    <li> product is great the amazon shipping took 2-3 weeks</li>
    <li> Smells great and exfoliates. It does dry out my sensitive skin if used everyday.</li>
    <li> The smell is off putting. It does the job. That&#x27;s about all I have to say. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliating but I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> This smells so natural! I love it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and fresh feeling on this body soap. Thanks i like it</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this body wash.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything to &amp;#34;even out&amp;#34; my skin or &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; it, but I love how it makes my skin feel afterward.  It does not dry your skin out nor does it leave weird soapy residue/film.  :)</li>
    <li> I have tried every St. Ive&#x27;s Skin product and every product is great! They have different soaps depending what your skin type or skin needs are. This soap has a little exfoliant particles that helps keep you skin soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the silica in the mix, my skin really is bright and the scent is lovely.</li>
    <li> Most soaps don&#x27;t bother me.  But this cent bothers me a lot and my allergies and I have to re-wash with another kind so I don&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
    <li> The smell is different, but it works well.</li>
    <li> great buy for guest room</li>
    <li> Great smelling and my skin is left super soft.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, works great...</li>
    <li> The product smell wonderful and performs as I thought it would. Great product I will purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works well.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I thought it would smell better, somewhat disappointed. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This gel delivers a good amount of suds.  The fragrance is very light so if you want a lit of fragrance this gel won&#x27;t wow you.  Not too girly for my husband to use.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice. Lathers well</li>
    <li> That will teach me not to read the description!  First off, I don&#x27;t care for the scent - THAT IS NOT A PINK GRAPEFRUIT ON THE LABEL!  :-)  Secondly, I didn&#x27;t realize THIS IS A SCRUB.  I like scrub on my FACE but I have to say my womanly parts aren&#x27;t so fond of it - it felt like I just got back from the beach and had sand inside my bikini bottom!  I threw it in the trash.  I love many of the St Ives products but this one does not fit the bill for me.  It&#x27;s enough to have to use a different product for my face, I refuse to have to use two different body washes - I want to be able to use one body wash for my entire body.</li>
    <li> Be sure to read the description carefully, I saw the picture that showed Energizing Citrus and bought it.  Big mistake.  What I got was Bright Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange.  Energizing Citrus is fantastic smelling. This is ok but not a fragrance I would have deliberately purchased and not what I thought I was buying.  Amazon, fix the picture.</li>

    <li> This stuff is pretty great made my wife&#x27;s dry sensitive skin evened out a little better</li>
    <li> I like this body wash. It&#x27;s not too overly fragrant but it does smell nice. Will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell and great exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Smells fine, but not great.  Exfoliates and works well on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love st ives products, this one works really good and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Creates a nice lather and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. There&#x27;s even some exfoliation in there, what more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Love this shower gel---smells fresh and is just as great as the expensive brands.  Thank you Amazon for making this available!&lt;br /&gt;:-0</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this body wash. Doesn&#x27;t smell all that great and does not lather up good on my puff</li>
    <li> Fresh Zest, eye awakening every morning</li>
    <li> I have always loved st Ives products over the years this product smells great but the exfoliating beads could b a bit better I use with my scubber brush and that works great ! Great value as well !!</li>
    <li> This smells so yummy. I wish I had body lotion and cologne to match! it leaves your skin soft and clean and is such a treat for the senses!</li>
    <li> I loooovvveee this stuff, it washes off all the dirt from my skin and it smells amazing. I, personally, love the smell, it certainly smells like oranges and grapefruits  EDIT: I&#x27;ve been having this problem consistently ever since I usedthe product the third time, but on this part of my neck I always get burned for some reason but not anywhere else on my body though, use with caution. It might just be cause that area of my neck is really sensitive.</li>
    <li> I Was Sort Of Scared Of Using This Because Of The Bad Reviews, But Those Reviews Are Based On The Scent Of The Product Rather Than Effectiveness. I Look At Skin Care Products As A Way To Improve My Skin, Not To Make It Smell Good. I Was Quite Impressed With How It Actually Brightened And Cleansed My Skin The Way It Was Supposed To, And The Scent Completely Goes Away After I Wash It Off And Use Lotion. I Have Only Used It Once, But I Think Its A Great Body Wash Non The Less (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while and works perfect! Smells great too. Also, once I ran out of face wash (I&#x27;ve been breaking out for years) and used this as a substitute... Haven&#x27;t bought face wash since. Nothing has ever really worked for my face but body wash cleaned it all up. Weird, but just thought I&#x27;d share!</li>
    <li> not the best soap but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Awesome bath soap and great skin exfoliating</li>
    <li> I love just about anything from ST Ives, I have been using it since it was priced low to get popular.</li>
    <li> Buy this if you love a strong citrus scent. It smells fantastic I wish they made a room or car deodorizer that smells like this. Very fresh scent!</li>
    <li> Grainy due to exfoliate. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells realllllly good, cleans well without striping the oils from your skin</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this body wash! It is really refreshing and slightly sweet. The body wash has a great exfoliation to it also that feels like a light sugar scrub. I have face wash in the same scent and this is what prompted me to pick this one up. I also want to mention that this 13.5oz bottle is easier to use than the larger size that Target seems to be moving to. I like this size, the product comes out smoother and it is easier to handle in the shower.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great prices on an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter, who tends to be picky about fragrance, but really likes to use body wash. This was the fourth body wash we tried, and we&#x27;re sold! She loves the smell and how it lathers up. Now my younger daughter wants some, too! I added this on my Subscribe and Save, and am happy to be a repeat costumer.,</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.  No complaints! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great deal and I love St. Ives but the bottle opened somehow and leaked all in the box. Happened in shipping I&#x27;m sure but :-(</li>
