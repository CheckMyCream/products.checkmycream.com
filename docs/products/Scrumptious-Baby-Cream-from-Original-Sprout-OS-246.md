      <li>love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Love Original Sprout!</li>
      <li>This is a rich lotion, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Not only is it super moisturizing, but I feel great about the ingredients used.</li>
      <li>Baby-fresh powdery scent that fades away to just a clean scent after you apply.</li>
      <li>Thick and creamy but not greasy and smells delicious.</li>
      <li>It not only helped moisturize her skin but it leaves her smelling good.</li>
      <li>I would suggest going to Whole Foods and trying one of their testers to make sure.</li>
      <li>Light, fresh and moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>but it smells delicious, its thick and soaks in quickly.</li>
      <li>The Original Sprout products are expensive, so it&#x27;s best to know for sure.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t get super flaky and went away within a week.</li>
      <li>and once I was pregnant I couldn&#x27;t use those creams anymore.</li>
      <li>It has a light, clean fragrance and is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It stays on nicely, scent more like &amp;#34;baby lotion&amp;#34; and fades after little bit.</li>
      <li>After trying so many products for my sons sensitive skin &amp; eczema flare ups, used this and the hair/body.babywash</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>By far my favorite body moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>They were quick and very reliable.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>We use it on our 3 month old, and it leaves her skin soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>but I choose it for the pure ingredients.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>(I have been on medicated creams my whole life)</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Fast and packages well.</li>
      <li>I use Original Sprout Shampoo &amp; Body Wash, and Deep Condutioner also.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>I like the Original Sprouts Deep Condition, and Detangler very much, so I bought seven of their other products - including this one.</li>
      <li>Not the super results I expected upon reading the rave reviews.</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals, you could literally eat this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I would absolutely buy it from the same vendor!!!</li>
      <li>It has made my baby&#x27;s skin really soft.</li>
      <li>soft and soothes my baby</li>
      <li>) I would put this on my infants hair after baths and it helped majorly with cradle cap.</li>
      <li>This lotion on the other hand worked very well!</li>
      <li>No strong smell, as many other baby creams have.</li>
      <li>Not only are the ingredients truly natural...</li>

<li> The Body Cream works great on both of my little ones (one which has bad eczema)</li>
<li> I was hesitant to try it since my daughter had dry skin and possible eczema</li>
<li> ; it does have scent to it due to the fact of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients: calendula, rosemary, cranberry, arnica, cucumber, coconut.</li>
<li> We have hard water and her skin was getting a little dried out from bath time - this skin cream makes it possible to go back to bathing her every night before bed.</li>
<li> The lotion, I was very eager to try, and was not impressed.</li>
<li> we have extremely hard water</li>
<li> Keeps kids skin soft for longer and protects from damaging it from bad weather.</li>
<li> I tried the oil and beanie thing and it didn&#x27;t help at all, maybe made it worse.</li>

    <li> Great sent, leaves baby sk8n soft and soothes my baby</li>
    <li> I was turned onto this line by a friend of mine while visiting in CA. This is what they reccomend at the hospital. After trying so many products for my sons sensitive skin &amp; eczema flare ups, used this and the hair/body.babywash and I&#x27;ve thrown everything else out. I even use the products myself &amp; have noticed it&#x27;s helped with my eczema as well.</li>
    <li> Great product, and great for your kids!!! No harsh chemicals, you could literally eat this stuff.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff..at this time the only  thing I can put on baby that does not cause a reaction</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!! I use all the baby products!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this for our son</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It works well and smells nice on my baby and me but I choose it for the pure ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love Original Sprout! The Body Cream works great on both of my little ones (one which has bad eczema)</li>
    <li> By far my favorite body moisturizer.  Light, fresh and moisturizing.  Baby-fresh powdery scent that fades away to just a clean scent after you apply.</li>

    <li> Hi! This is a rich lotion, but it&#x27;s ok. Not the super results I expected upon reading the rave reviews. I like the Original Sprouts Deep Condition, and Detangler very much, so I bought seven of their other products - including this one. The lotion, I was very eager to try, and was not impressed. Nubian Heritage&#x27;s Rose and Goat Milk lotion is divine. I think that&#x27;s a better lotion. I would suggest going to Whole Foods and trying one of their testers to make sure. The Original Sprout products are expensive, so it&#x27;s best to know for sure. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever! Smells so delicious and actually lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I have been using it on my children since they were babies. Not greasy, and smells great. I use it myself HEAD to TOE! I always give it as a gift for baby showers.</li>
    <li> Best product for kids</li>
    <li> This company is amazing and their products are perfection. The best smell. The best feel. The most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I would put this on my infants hair after baths and it helped majorly with cradle cap. It wouldn&#x27;t get super flaky and went away within a week. I tried the oil and beanie thing and it didn&#x27;t help at all, maybe made it worse. This lotion on the other hand worked very well! NOT GREASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) we have extremely hard water and this definitely helps skin stay moisturizer longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I have always had severe eczema (I have been on medicated creams my whole life) and once I was pregnant I couldn&#x27;t use those creams anymore. I started using this lotion and this company&#x27;s body wash-- I have hadn&#x27;t had a flare up in over a year. I haven&#x27;t had any sign of eczema since I started using solely these products on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best baby cream EVER. Helped to end my baby&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without. Seller excellent. Fast and packages well.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Never broke out my baby</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion.  Our daughter loves it and it smells great.  We will not use anything else on her!</li>
    <li> Not only are the ingredients truly natural...but it smells delicious, its thick and soaks in quickly. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!! This has Tetrasodium in it. Tetrasodium is a preservative that’s made from the known carcinogen, formaldehyde and sodium cyanide</li>
    <li> No added parabens, etc. Even tho is says &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34; it does have scent to it due to the fact of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients: calendula, rosemary, cranberry, arnica, cucumber, coconut. It stays on nicely, scent more like &amp;#34;baby lotion&amp;#34; and fades after little bit.</li>
    <li> the package was damaged, but I love this cream for my baby</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion our family will use from now on. It isn&#x27;t greasy, it helps with eczema breakouts, and it smells so good. Not just for kids -- we all use it.</li>
    <li> love this lotion. best smell and makes my daughters skin so soft! I would tell anyone to use this item</li>
    <li> I feel great about this product! Not only is it super moisturizing, but I feel great about the ingredients used. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love it! Thick and creamy but not greasy and smells delicious. It has become my fav and I am using it for myself too...!</li>
    <li> this is the best baby lotion ever.  It has a light, clean fragrance and is very moisturizing.  Perfect for new baby skin.</li>
    <li> I love this  cream and the body wash. I was hesitant to try it since my daughter had dry skin and possible eczema but it worked out perfect. It not only helped moisturize her skin but it leaves her smelling good. It&#x27;s also safer products. Highly, highly recommend it! I wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything else. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream! We use it on our 3 month old, and it leaves her skin soft and smooth! We have hard water and her skin was getting a little dried out from bath time - this skin cream makes it possible to go back to bathing her every night before bed. We love it!</li>
    <li> Helps with my babies eczema. People always compliment that my kids smell good. I use Original Sprout Shampoo &amp; Body Wash, and Deep Condutioner also.</li>
