      <li>lol works great!</li>
      <li>Great makeup brush bag.</li>
      <li>This is a very nicely made brush roll.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size and can easily tuck into your carry on bag.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a makeup brush bag that was good quality and functional.</li>
      <li>My stepdaughter got this for a Christmas gift, she really loved it.</li>
      <li>Very pleased when opening this brush roll-up.  </li>
      <li>this was a gift for my wife, she seemed to like it and was very pleased to have it</li>
      <li>I just put everything in the top set of pockets and it works great.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice way to keep brushes organized and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have had this for about 6 months now and absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for my Bare Minerals makeup brushes.  </li>
      <li>I really love it - great space, keeps things well organized, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nicely made, sturdy with strong stitching &amp; the fabric</li>
      <li>The belt roll itself is just fine, and a nice product.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a case with the flap across the top to protect the brush bristles when rolled up.  </li>
      <li>My brushes were kept in perfect condition unlike the last brush organizer I used; no bent or damaged bristles.  </li>
      <li>Great buy, very well made pouch.</li>
      <li>But I did expect my brushes to actually fit!</li>
      <li>much more practical for me.  </li>
      <li>I am a make brush entheasuist and have many and that is why I ordered this case.</li>
      <li>love you honey....</li>
      <li>Buy one you will love it.</li>
      <li>Easy to roll up and has a flap to keep your brushes held in place and secure.</li>
      <li>Works just fine for my makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>I had to trim the handles on my longer brushes so that they would fit inside, but I didn&#x27;t mind since I wanted something compact for traveling.  </li>
      <li>The material does not have the cheap vinyl feel/</li>
      <li>The brushes just barely fit height-wise and my blush brush because its angled does not.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice product but didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
      <li>Small and perfect for traveling!  </li>
      <li>Originally, I put a foam makeup wedge in one &amp; a silica packet in another to absorb moisture that could cause makeup still on the brushes to cake.  </li>
      <li>With the back pouch filled, the front pouch becomes unusable for any fat handles but can easily store skinny-handled items, with the crowded space helping to make a tighter more secure fit</li>
      <li>Still able to use it for some Eco Tools brushes and Real Techniques.</li>
      <li>Brushes are safe in their individual compartments then a large flap comes over the brushes to keep safe and clean.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own a brush as short as this holder will allow so</li>
      <li>The outer fabric is very rich for a synthetic and sturdy, but not stiff.  </li>
      <li>The aesthetic of it isn&#x27;t all that great, but it least it&#x27;s not ugly.</li>
      <li>I was also very pleased with the soft material and so far it shows no wear and tear.</li>
      <li>The feel is high quality and the strap that surrounds the case encircles it twice before velcroing so it holds it securely.  </li>
      <li>Just to save others from the same mistake, be sure the length of your brushes is ok for this size, otherwise, the professional size is just as nice...only longer.  </li>
      <li>This product holds several of my brushes and keeps them safe.  </li>
      <li>This brush roll is exactly what I was looking for to hold my makeup brushes.  </li>
      <li>The roll itself is only 8 pockets across, with another 8 stacked on top of it.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s ok, it doesn&#x27;t look too cheap but doesn&#x27;t look like I paid much for it.</li>
      <li>Other than that the product is ok and it isn&#x27;t worth the money to return.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to just unroll on the vanity, use your brushes and then roll them back up.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this, not expecting a whole lot.</li>
      <li>Overall: if you only have short eyeshadow brushes and don&#x27;t care about how it looks, you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
      <li>I like the inside material because it is easy to clean, but the exterior material is like cheap fake leather.  </li>
      <li>High hopes that I will no longer have to be concerned that the eye liner brush won&#x27;t survive.  </li>
      <li>Just be careful the brushes you intend to store in this bag aren&#x27;t more than 6 inches long, as they won&#x27;t fit properly and could be damaged by the flap.</li>
      <li>A couple rolls from the left to right</li>
      <li>The 4 corner pockets are VERY small but might be nice to store a couple tissues.  </li>
      <li>Very professional case.</li>
      <li>Other thing is it really only has 8 slots with slots on top of those slots.  </li>
      <li>My brushes aren&#x27;t very long, but they didn&#x27;t fit under the flap by a long shot.</li>
      <li>I find it takes too much time to unroll the whole thing just to use a few brushes</li>
      <li>Brush pouches are layered on top of each other with the openings of shorter ones in front starting down 3/4&amp;#34; below the back pouch openings.  </li>
      <li>This roll holds a lot of brushes but is probably too much for your average daily makeup routine.  </li>

<li> I ended up doubling up the small brushes in the same slot and even fit three really small brushes together.</li>
<li> Rolls out long enough to hold all your brushes.</li>
<li> I use this daily, I am not a professional</li>
<li> At 6 3/4&amp;#34; the height of this &amp;#34;Travel Line&amp;#34; version fits everything I needed it to without squishing my brush heads or being too long for where I store it; if you have longer brushes you might want the 9&amp;#34; version (Studio Line).  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s difficult to clean when the brushes get makeup on the inside.</li>
<li> It was gross, messy and left me searching on Amazon for an answer.  </li>
<li> mistakenly ordered this travel sized one and was initially disappointed my brushes didn&#x27;t fit until I learned my error and ordered the standard size one.  </li>
<li> did not fit my brushes in length or with this should be called a pencil holder not a professional brush holder</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed but for the most part i can use it.  </li>
<li> Eventually, all of the remaining make up would fall off onto the handles of the other brushes, creating a mess for me each time I went to use them!</li>
<li> Takes up little space and I use with the Bdellium Travel line of brushes.</li>
<li> However, I like MAC and Sigma brushes and they do not fit in this roll.  </li>
<li> so I also had room for my tweezers &amp; a small scissors (with plastic tip protector to keep from damaging the roll).  </li>
<li> but to me it&#x27;s just another thing for her to add to her excessive luggage.</li>
<li> I brought this bag to store small electronic tools.</li>
<li> It is so delicate that keeping undamaged has been a continual nightmare.</li>
<li> My complaints are that the color selection is weird (army green?)</li>
<li> I bought this brush roll-up because I was tired of having all my brushes in a pouch.  </li>

    <li> I brought this bag to store small electronic tools. It can be used by anyone for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Very pleased when opening this brush roll-up.  The outer fabric is very rich for a synthetic and sturdy, but not stiff.  The slots will hold any variety of brushes and the flip-down protector is key.  Very professional case.</li>
    <li> This brush roll is exactly what I was looking for to hold my makeup brushes.  I wanted to separate my brushes instead of throwing them all together in a brush pouch.  The roll itself is only 8 pockets across, with another 8 stacked on top of it.  I just put everything in the top set of pockets and it works great.  There&#x27;s also tiny pockets at the ends of the roll.  I wanted a case with the flap across the top to protect the brush bristles when rolled up.  I also like the Velcro strap, I prefer it over the rolls that use strings to tie up.  The max brush length it holds is about 6\\&quot;.  I had to trim the handles on my longer brushes so that they would fit inside, but I didn&#x27;t mind since I wanted something compact for traveling.  Rolled up, this case was sturdier and smaller than the brush pouch I was using.  The quality seems solid too, leather outer and nylon inner.  I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for crochet hooks.....lol works great!</li>
    <li> Works just fine for my makeup brushes. Nothing fancy. My complaints are that the color selection is weird (army green?) and it&#x27;s difficult to clean when the brushes get makeup on the inside.</li>
    <li> This roll is nearly perfect for me...At 6 3/4&amp;#34; the height of this &amp;#34;Travel Line&amp;#34; version fits everything I needed it to without squishing my brush heads or being too long for where I store it; if you have longer brushes you might want the 9&amp;#34; version (Studio Line).  It&#x27;s nicely made, sturdy with strong stitching &amp; the fabric is durable.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of brushes so I also had room for my tweezers &amp; a small scissors (with plastic tip protector to keep from damaging the roll).  The 4 corner pockets are VERY small but might be nice to store a couple tissues.  Originally, I put a foam makeup wedge in one &amp; a silica packet in another to absorb moisture that could cause makeup still on the brushes to cake.  Eventually, I removed the stitching between them to make 2 larger pockets instead... much more practical for me.  Brush pouches are layered on top of each other with the openings of shorter ones in front starting down 3/4&amp;#34; below the back pouch openings.  With the back pouch filled, the front pouch becomes unusable for any fat handles but can easily store skinny-handled items, with the crowded space helping to make a tighter more secure fit so they won&#x27;t fall out. To hold my double-ended brushes, I glued strips of Velcro inside the wrap &amp; onto the brush handles!  [Updated this review 6 14 2015]</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush roll-up for about 6 months.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and can easily tuck into your carry on bag.

    <li> I like this product just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.  The brushes just barely fit height-wise and my blush brush because its angled does not.  I was a little disappointed but for the most part i can use it.  Other thing is it really only has 8 slots with slots on top of those slots.  If you have a wider circular handle there won&#x27;t be room for another.  I ended up doubling up the small brushes in the same slot and even fit three really small brushes together.</li>
    <li> My stepdaughter got this for a Christmas gift, she really loved it. I, personally, never examined it that closely but she loaded it up with her brushes (also a gift) and was very happy!</li>
    <li> Small and perfect for traveling!  Takes up little space and I use with the Bdellium Travel line of brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, not expecting a whole lot. But I did expect my brushes to actually fit! My brushes aren&#x27;t very long, but they didn&#x27;t fit under the flap by a long shot.

    <li> This roll holds a lot of brushes but is probably too much for your average daily makeup routine.  I like the inside material because it is easy to clean, but the exterior material is like cheap fake leather.  I find it takes too much time to unroll the whole thing just to use a few brushes so I just use it to store my extras and have downgraded to a much smaller holder for my day to day use.  It&#x27;s a nice product but didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
    <li> The belt roll itself is just fine, and a nice product.  However, I like MAC and Sigma brushes and they do not fit in this roll.  I bought it thinking I could use it as a universal brush roll but could not. Still able to use it for some Eco Tools brushes and Real Techniques.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush bag. I had been looking for a makeup brush bag that was good quality and functional. This bag is everything I hoped for. Buy one you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have searched far and wide for a replacement brush holder.  I use this daily, I am not a professional so this is just to keep my brushes in line at home and while I travel.  I really love it - great space, keeps things well organized, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The perfect travel rollup makeup brush holder. Easy to roll up and has a flap to keep your brushes held in place and secure. Rolls out long enough to hold all your brushes. Just be careful the brushes you intend to store in this bag aren&#x27;t more than 6 inches long, as they won&#x27;t fit properly and could be damaged by the flap. Great buy, very well made pouch.</li>

Eventually, all of the remaining make up would fall off onto the handles of the other brushes, creating a mess for me each time I went to use them! It was gross, messy and left me searching on Amazon for an answer.  Like always, Amazon came to the rescue.  I have had this for about 6 months now and absolutely love it!  Brushes are safe in their individual compartments then a large flap comes over the brushes to keep safe and clean.  A couple rolls from the left to right and you&#x27;re good to go. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my wife, she seemed to like it and was very pleased to have it but to me it&#x27;s just another thing for her to add to her excessive luggage. love you honey....</li>
    <li> This product holds several of my brushes and keeps them safe.  While traveling, I do not have to worry about my brushes getting ruined. It also keeps them organized.  Excellent quality!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my Bare Minerals makeup brushes.  I&#x27;ll be using it for travel.  High hopes that I will no longer have to be concerned that the eye liner brush won&#x27;t survive.  It is so delicate that keeping undamaged has been a continual nightmare.</li>
    <li> did not fit my brushes in length or with this should be called a pencil holder not a professional brush holder</li>

Just to save others from the same mistake, be sure the length of your brushes is ok for this size, otherwise, the professional size is just as nice...only longer.  Very happy with bdellium products and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a make brush entheasuist and have many and that is why I ordered this case. The picture in my opinion is misleading in the size. I don&#x27;t own a brush as short as this holder will allow so I will use if for pencils. Other than that the product is ok and it isn&#x27;t worth the money to return. Would not buy again.</li>
