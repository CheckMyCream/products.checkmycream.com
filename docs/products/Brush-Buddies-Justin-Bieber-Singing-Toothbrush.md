      <li>I am certain that many young girls would love to be sang a Justin Bieber song as they brush their teeth!</li>
      <li>, it played 2 full length songs.</li>
      <li>not as a gag gift but as a useful item that included her Bieber obsession.  </li>
      <li>but the audio is good, and it actually plays the whole song.</li>
      <li>Should have read the reviews , It was a cute brush and my 12 year old daughter loves the way it plays music by Justin Bieber.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m scrambling to get fresh batteries.</li>

      <li>It was liked by the little girl we gave it to...</li>
      <li>I thought it was a concert DVD, instead it was more of a documentory, it was not what I expected</li>
      <li>who wants Justin Bieber singing in their mouth?)</li>
      <li>WELL SHE REALLY LOVES TO BRUSH HER TEETH</li>
      <li>its a 25% chance that i would get the color my daughter wants.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The sound quality isn&#x27;t too great, but my younger sister still loves it.</li>
    <li> Gave it to a Beiber hater for his birthday and he loved it!!</li>
    <li> Summer 2013 and still running on original batteries. Found replacement heads at drug store. My daughter really likes it but she doesn&#x27;t use it every time she brushes because orthodontist gave us sonic one since she got her braces on.</li>
    <li> Great gag gift at a white elephant party!</li>
    <li> We purchased one of these and had it shipped to our niece for her 5th Birthday. She loved it and she was very happy. What can I say, the kid loves Justin Bieber. Her mother said that she won&#x27;t let anyone else touch it now, lol. I was under the impression that it only played a partial clip (like a ringtone) but it didn&#x27;t, it played 2 full length songs. The music actually sounded like it was coming from a little radio, it was clear enough to play and sing along to (unlike some products that have a muffled sound). She was happy, so we were happy.</li>
    <li> okay so apparently your boyfriend will not think its hot</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this gift for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Sad that I received this product for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday and the batteries are dead... Now I&#x27;m scrambling to get fresh batteries. Will be really ticked off if it&#x27;s just broken. What a waste...</li>
    <li> what color is the toothbrush very important details left out... Your main pic shows purple but the fine print does not say a specific color. its a 25% chance that i would get the color my daughter wants. please update your information this is very important to most kids that likes color...............</li>
    <li> Should have read the reviews , It was a cute brush and my 12 year old daughter loves the way it plays music by Justin Bieber. But it&#x27;s not like other kids tooth brushes it doesn&#x27;t spin. Just a simple toothbrush. Kudos to the dual buttons one for morning and one for night, that plays different songs..</li>
    <li> MY NIECE WAS VERY HAPPY, THIS WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT ALONG MANY OTHER JUSTIN BIEBER ITEMS. SHE WAS VERY PLEASED. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Returned 3 of these to get one that worked. 1st one was missing the brush itself. Second and third one came with dead batties(wouldn&#x27;t play at all/song cut out after a second or two). Waste of money for such a poor quality product.</li>
    <li> Thank you arrived on time for Christmas. Daughter loved it and fit perfectly Packaging was very professional. She brushes her teeth more often now that she can sing to beiber</li>
    <li> Again my grand daughter loves this tooth brush. The song plays just the right amount of time for brushing. I don&#x27;t have to worry if she brushes long enough.</li>
    <li> Great gift, and was enjoyed very much. Thought it was a good idea to purchase the batteries and the extra heads at the same time. Works well and gives that little extra reason for a grandchild to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> My Son loves it!  Can hear him brushing all the way from downstairs!</li>
    <li> White elephant Christmas gift that my younger cousin ended up with. She was ecstatic upon opening it, and it worked.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Toothbrush finally arrived day late Ty fed ex post,batteries dead and leaking,new my a,hope you have better good luck.new??.....new my</li>
    <li> Decent toothbrush. Bought it as a joke for my boyfriend. He didn&#x27;t like it but he used it anyway to brush his teeth!</li>
    <li> The idea is great but the brush itself does not play as well as I would have thought it would also the top of the brush comes off and has to be put back on</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my nieces and they love it. They wake up signing with Justin Bieber every morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a neat little gift to add as a little extra for anyone fan of Justin Bieber. The package came with high quality colors, and unlike the other Justin Bieber brush, this toothbrush has songs that are recent, and play loud and clear. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of this but the audio is good, and it actually plays the whole song. Definitely a last minute add-on I&#x27;d recommend to anyone. On a side-note though being the batteries are not of the easily obtainable variety (They&#x27;re not AA or AAA) I&#x27;d recommend buying this as close to the gift date as possible, you may also find it cheaper to just buy a new brush when the batteries run out I don&#x27;t find $6-7 to be too unreasonable for something like this.</li>
    <li> My 4-year-old neice has Bieber Fever, so she LOVES this toothbrush!  My only complaint is that it comes with a full adult-sized brush head.  I wish that there was an option for smaller sized brush heads to make it easier for a child to use.  I also like that each song sings for 2 minutes giving the child a good goal to keep brushing until the music stops.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!  She now has fun brushing her teeth! But she wishes it played more than two songs.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an aside gift for my 6 year old granddaughter who can&#x27;t get enough Bieber.  She absolutely loved it.  I think she loved it more than anything else she got for Christmas.  I had heard someone saying it was a good gag gift for a christmas party and I thought of her.....not as a gag gift but as a useful item that included her Bieber obsession.  She brushed her teeth so much we had to get new batteries within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it thanks she looks toward to every morning just to hear Justin beiber singing to her every morning</li>
    <li> These brushes have HUGE brush heads. Way too big for any child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries do not last long and if the un-protected battery compartment gets wet, the song goes high pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a well made product.</li>
    <li> Product is terrible. Was dead on arrival, and was a grab bag gift, so I didn&#x27;t until someone unwrapped it in front of me and I was embarrassed. We opened the brush up and the batteries were corroded inside. BEWARE of wasting your money and time.</li>
    <li> This is a cute gift for Justin Beiber fans.  The song is not very clear.. but it is cute. It was liked by the little girl we gave it to...</li>
    <li> This was a magical gag gift.</li>
    <li> The sound is a little rough,but my 9 yr old daughter absolutely loves it and she added an extra brushing when she comes home from school.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was strictly for laughs and it couldn&#x27;t even pull that off. When it failed to generate any audible Bieber blather, I checked the batteries (3 disk batteries) and they all had some level of corrosion. Not worth returning and certainly not worth the expense of 3 new batteries. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d give it a 1 star - but the absurd pointlessness of the device and implied desperation of the Bieber endorsement gets it the extra star.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent tooth brush that plays very low quality music as expected. It was purchased as a novelty item.</li>
    <li> Brushing her teeth has never been more fun as she&#x27;s singing along with Justin. very nice present or give especially for little girls nice toothbrush great price and is not cheaply made this will last her awhile and they sell the replacement tops for these brushes on here</li>
    <li> The particular brush that I got had dead batteries, so I never enjoyed the whole singing portion of my brush as I was too lazy to get new batteries and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money either. However, the most disappointing part of this brush was the brush head. It&#x27;s really large. I read a review from another customer that said something about the brush being targeted with tweens/young girls and that the large head was weird for that. I agree. It&#x27;s uncomfortably large.</li>
    <li> Everything about this brush was great except I thought the head of the brush was too big. Obviously this is going to be for a child or tween and I don&#x27;t even like my tooth brush with a head this big. They should make them smaller. The kids loved it though. No complaints from them.</li>
    <li> She loved it while it lasted, but shorted out quickly.</li>
    <li> Great gift for a kid.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for a little girl-she loves it!(but it sounds like torture to me-who wants Justin Bieber singing in their mouth?) I bet it will drive her mother nuts-he sings 2 different  songs. Boy, the stuff 7 year olds like!</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second one for my daughter because the first one didn&#x27;t work at all, the brush head was very hard to get in and broke. I don&#x27;t know if it came with dead batteries or is just broke, but it never played a song, hopefully the second one works. My daughter was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> very good for kids satify my neice she loves it if i had the money i would buy all the kids one if i can</li>
    <li> Granddaughter was so hoping for a purple toothbrush so I got 2 hoping against odds. Nope, she got red and yellow but still had it before many of her friends because the local stores were out. Found a purple shortly thereafter but she declined. Some day she&#x27;ll look back at her crazes and hopefully remember who got it for her.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas. The toothbrush broke the same day she used it. I was not very happy with it</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift for my daughter. Its ok. I did not know i coupd get it in purple. An they sent me yellow so ugly. An the songs r not clear.</li>
    <li> Best joke gift ever. Give it to somone you don;t like who has bad teeth.</li>
    <li> I was actually looking for a toothbrush I&#x27;d heard about that sings as they brush, but it sings about the teeth and when to move from one spot to another.  This was a disappointing replacement as far as I am concerned.  Not the fault of the product or seller.  It&#x27;s just that I couldn&#x27;t find the one I really wanted.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this thing. I personally think it&#x27;s a little funny, but if it gets her to brush her teeth for two to three minutes at a time, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY THIS ITEM ITS SUPPOSE TO PLAY 2 SONGS EACH FOR 2 MIN &amp; DONT ! IT WAS A BDAY GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER &amp; SHE WAS SUPER DISAPPOINTED !!!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review since I am not a Justin Bieber fan but realized that the order deserved a review. I actually purchased this as a gag gift for someone who lives in fear of receiving such an item; however, once she got over the humiliation (LOL) she is using it with the music disabled. It works great and is all you can expect from this type of product. I am certain that many young girls would love to be sang a Justin Bieber song as they brush their teeth!</li>
    <li> hello! i rcieved my package today! its soo beutiful and it was very good! thanks alot im so so happt i really loved it thanks &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It is so awesome and cute!</li>
    <li> It was a hit at Christmas for my Bieber fan - but she wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with the quality of the song.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool idea, but the audio on this toothbrush is AWFUL. You can barely tell what&#x27;s being sung and you can&#x27;t shut it off once it starts so you have to listen to the whole gawd-awful thing until the end.</li>
    <li> Play&#x27;s cute songs and she thought it was the best thing ever being a justin bieber fan. What a great idea!</li>
    <li> My neice loved this toothbrush, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t.  It was a great gift for someone who had some dental work done.</li>
    <li> product as discribed  slow service  well package daughter happy boxed in nice attactive box. worked well. uses alot battery time.</li>
    <li> received the product with in the time frame given. The packaging was damaged in transit but still ok. I purchased as a gift for my grand daughter. She will love it</li>
    <li> The battery cable had pulled free from the circuit board. I had to resolder it to make it work. Not too worried since this was a gag gift that didn&#x27;t cost much in the first place. I would not recommend for people who are not handy with fixing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The sound quality is not that great. But it&#x27;s just a gag gift.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it is not water resistant at all.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my niece who loves JB...</li>
    <li> My little sister is going to love this! It is a normal tooth brush that sings two songs. The songs aren&#x27;t as clear as I wish...but it will be a fun gift!</li>
    <li> I thought it was a concert DVD, instead it was more of a documentory, it was not what I expected but girls were OK with it.</li>
    <li> If your child like Justin Bieber songs, this toothbrush is a must have.  Can be used with or without brush</li>
    <li> Very disapointed ordered this toothbrush as a Christmas gift and it did not work...hated seeing a child upset on Christmas...and hate to buy batteries for a brand new item!!!!</li>
    <li> My friend&#x27;s kid loves this!  Don&#x27;t know if he brushes his teeth with it, but he ran around the house playing it for an hour after he got it and it was still playing afterward, so the thing must have good batteries.  :-)</li>
    <li> My daughter was so happy to try and it never worked. Box was also crushed. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> THE MUSIC PLAYS SURPRISINGLY WELL SHE REALLY LOVES TO BRUSH HER TEETH A LOT MORE IT WAS HER FAVORITE BIRTHDAY PRESENT</li>
    <li> this brush has two songs, somebody to love and love me.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my niece , she just 10 and she really like this one.&lt;br /&gt;but songs are very rough to hear but good for kids who have Bieber fever lol</li>
    <li> i just go the new boyfriend singing toothbrush at walgreens. it is so great! i love it plays the whole entire song in two mintues. its great to listen to and to dance to. BEST TOOTHBRUSH EVER!</li>
    <li> During an overnight stay at my brother&#x27;s, my daughter&#x27;s toothbrush would turn on spontaneously and the wouldn&#x27;t stop and it was all high pitched and very annoying. We had to throw it away when we got home.</li>
