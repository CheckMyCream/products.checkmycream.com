    <li> It&#x27;s it her 4th purchase</li>
    <li> I get sooooo many compliments on this scent....guys and gals.  It&#x27;s light, feminine and just smells wonderful. My co-worker was wearing it one day and I just had to ask her what it was...then I bought it lol. I&#x27;m a person who&#x27;s very sensitive to smell and some perfumes are too strong for me. But this one definitely does the trick. I have heard some people say that it smells differently on them than it smells on me. I highly recommend this perfume!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, I can not find it in the stores and so I order it off line. I hope they never quit selling it, I get a lot of compliments on it at work the way it smells.</li>

    <li> This was a gift request , so it must smell wonderful, So I bought two more for Xmas gifts.  Smart thinking</li>
    <li> Not sure this is the real thing. It&#x27;s strong and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like my daughters and she bought hers and Macy&#x27;s.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had the most compliments on this perfume and it is by far the least expensive that I have ever had! I have had coworkers and friends buy this after smelling it on me :) I hope it is always available</li>
