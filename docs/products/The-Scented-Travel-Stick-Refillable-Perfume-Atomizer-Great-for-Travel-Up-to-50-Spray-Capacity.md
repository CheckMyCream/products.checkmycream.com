      <li>and I would love to carry my favorite perfume around with me in this little package but the bottom leaks!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d actually carry it in my purse for fear the top will come off.  </li>

      <li>cute little product, just not very easy to refill it</li>
      <li>does leak (my purse smells great), but my perfume is too expensive to waste.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> cute little product, just not very easy to refill it</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s so convenient to use. I&#x27;ve always sprayed perfume before I left the house but it always wears off within a couple hours. Now I can take my perfume with me without carrying a heavy glass bottle in my purse. This is very easy to fill up and doesn&#x27;t leak at all. It sprays my perfume perfectly. It looks really cute too! It&#x27;s nice that you can also see how much perfume you have left so you never have to worry about running out while you aren&#x27;t home. It&#x27;s perfect for traveling and you can even bring it on a plane. I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing other colors so I could have more than one perfume choice with me on the go! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Convenient way to carry a perfume in your purse</li>
    <li> I got the pink one. It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel or just everyday use in your purse or glove compartment in the car. I carry mine in my purse everywhere I go.&lt;br /&gt;I got this item at a discounted price for an honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> Nice to have to have perfume on the go. Do wish it came with clearer instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review</li>
    <li> Lovely little perfume bottle. Easy to use and so cute and feminine. I love that it has an opening on the bottle so I&#x27;m able to tell how much more perfume I have left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase this at a discount for a fair review on Amazon.  I do like this, but it does have a tiny little leak to it.  Nothing bad and it is very easy to use and carry.  It is nice to have a little container of my perfume available to carry to use when possible.  The tiny little leak doesn&#x27;t leave any wet marks or stains, but you can smell the perfume on the stick.  I would purchase one of these again to carry around to have it available in my purse.</li>
    <li> Really cool product. Easy to use and a perfect solution for travel! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome, I don&#x27;t have to carry my big bottle of perfume when I travel.</li>
    <li> I got this sent to travel stick a few weeks ago and I love it. It is so easy to put your favorite perfumes inside of it. I know that it&#x27;s for travel but I mainly keep it in my purse so that I can have my favorite perfume with me and I&#x27;ll times with me without bringing the big bottle out. This little sent to travel stick fits perfectly in my purse and even in my gym bag. I was given this sent to travel stick at a discounted price and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Just take the sprayer nozzle off of your perfume and place the bottom of travel stick against the perfume bottle and pump.  Instead of the perfume going into the air, it goes into the stick.  Great money saver by using your normal bottle.</li>
    <li> This is super cute stylish and easy to refill. I am now able to take my favorite perfume with me where ever I go.  Its so small fits in my pocket.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great idea,but suggest you fill it up just before you leave and use it quickly. It will hold the perfume for about 2 weeks--not indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;It does leak (my purse smells great), but my perfume is too expensive to waste. I guess I will just have to buy a smaller bottle to&lt;br /&gt;take along with me.</li>
    <li> Love how I can make myself a travel version of my favorite but large bottle of perfume. So easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love how convenient it is to have my perfume with me on the go. It holds quite a bit while still being very compact so I can keep it in my purse or jacket pocket. It is also nice for traveling and doesn&#x27;t leak! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have seen these travel sticks at the mall but never purchased one because they are so expensive! I absolutely had to get one for my brother&#x27;s graduation so I figured I would give one a try. Luckily I found this product available during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words and experiences. The travel stick is about the size of a chapstick which is great for travel and all on the go needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this product arrived I was expecting a twist off lid to pour my perfume, but I was so glad when I saw the easy spray option. Any perfume of choice can be added to the travel stick by taking off the small top of a perfume, inserting it at the bottom of the travel stick and pushing down to get the perfume out. This is an amazing idea! I can now get my perfume of choice on the go in a cute pink color. The travel stick sprayer works well and does not leak. I showed my new travel stick to my family and everyone was blow away! My mom, brother and several of my friends have all asked me to get them one. This travel stick is perfect for travelers! I take mine everywhere in my purse and it does not drip and hardly it weighs anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This travel stick is a great gift for men as well. Since most men do not usually carry purses, this travel stick is the right size for men&#x27;s pocket. I bought my husband a black one and he throws it in his pocket along with his chapstick. My husband said he needs 10 more of these sticks, because they are perfect for the car, pockets, carry on bags or any other place! I love that I can carry my favorite perfume on the go without spending tons of money on the travel size perfumes. This is a perfect gift idea, easy to use and it never gets old because you can change the perfume constantly!! I need a bulk size pack of these perfumes, everyone I know would love one!</li>
    <li> This item was a huge disappointment. It&#x27;s great in theory and I would love to carry my favorite perfume around with me in this little package but the bottom leaks!  Unless I want to put it in a ziploc bag and then into my purse, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> The scented travel stick is small and light to carry around your purse which is perfect for me when I am travelling around. This save too much space and i&#x27;ll just pop them up whenever i wanted to use them. The delivery was on time. It was in good condition and totally love it!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of taking my favorite perfume with me. I filled it up and two days later it was a gone because it had a hole in it or it just evaporated. I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a cute little thing.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d actually carry it in my purse for fear the top will come off.  was given a discount in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This refillable perfume atomizer is small enough to carry in my purse, and is easy to refill. I like the pretty pink color, too.</li>
    <li> I decided to ignore the other reviewers and give this a try for our vacation. Needless to say, the other reviewers were right...this thing leaks and not just a little. It leaks pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I was going to give this a bad rating and say it didn&#x27;t work until I read the review given by mmarrero and looked at her pictures!&lt;br /&gt;It was so easy to fill given her step by step instructions and I found out that I was doing it wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I love this little travel stick!  It&#x27;s very lightweight and works perfectly.  Took no time at all to fill it and although the spray is a jet stream as opposed to a fine mist, it&#x27;s going to work perfectly for my travels this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to chose the pink color because the rest of the colors were sold out, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s not a neon pink at all and it&#x27;s so shiny and beautiful.</li>
    <li> It leaks after 3 days of using&lt;br /&gt;Maybe there is a defect with my item</li>
    <li> This product is Awful!!!! And whine I say awful I mean awful! I filled it with perfume and within hours the perfume came out on and seep all over my purse. Save your money and buy it somewhere else. I have 3 from another brand and didn&#x27;t have this issue. What a shame! zero starts!!</li>
    <li> I love this! It has saved me from having to carry my huge bottle of perfume. My purse thanks you.</li>
