    <li> I received the correct product for my shaver.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but the company communication was weak.</li>
    <li> Works good. No issues</li>
    <li> Delivered early and as promised</li>
    <li> Wahl shaver replacement head arrived a day before the scheduled time. I use the shaver for balding my head, sometimes it will not get all the hairs with medium applied pressure.</li>
    <li> Advertisement shows a GOLD foil like the original one that came with shaver.  I received a SILVER one. The SILVER foil does not cut cleanly after a couple of passes and tends to yank and pull on my hair causing burns and irritation.  I would have returned it but threw away the package long before I used the foil. I did not contact the seller because I did not want to go through the hassle of returning the item for $15.  If you need to get a replacement foil, stick with the GOLD one. I had no issues with it for over two years.</li>
    <li> very satisied-very happy with product</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice price</li>
    <li> These are just not lasting.  After a few uses the foil breaks.</li>
