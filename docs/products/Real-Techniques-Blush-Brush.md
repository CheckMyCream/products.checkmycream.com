    <li> I like real techniques brushes for the most part. This one I do not like. I bought it to apply contour powder. The brush is way too dense and because of that the bristles are stiff. I tried dabbing the powder onto my face with this brush but it is pointless because I end up using another brush to blend it. I wish I would have bought from amazon so I could have returned it. I bought it at Walmart. I have not found a use for it yet. If you want a super dense brush this may be perfect for you but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so great! They do not loose their bristles like cheaper brands and they keep their shape well.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I find it perfect for contouring or applying blush or highlighter. The bristles are pretty dense and pick up just the right amount of product and blends smoothly. The handle/feral seems to be well made and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding. Overall I love the RT brand as it is so this brush is no exception.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected from Real Techniques... Another brush that does well for its intended use.  The bristles are soft, but dense.  Excellent for contouring and blending out  any harsh edges.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a foundation brush not a sculpting brush because I watch Sam&amp;Nic Chapman YouTube video. It&#x27;s just perfect. It gives you more coverage than duo fiber brush such as M.A.C.187 and at the same time a more natural look that traditional foundation brush. A must have!</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite brush from the company to date! I use it for my bronzer and to contour it is the best brush!!!</li>
    <li> Hair length is too short that makes it too dense to apply contouring powder</li>
    <li> originally I thought I was going to use this to contour, which its great for cream contour, but OMG it&#x27;s AMAZING to buff in your foundation and under eye concealer. I loveee &amp; definitely will repurchase a backup. &amp; it washes super easy!</li>
    <li> Favorite foundation brush and worth every penny!!! I use it every day on my clients</li>
    <li> Omg this brush is a main at blending concealer!!!! I use this brush every day! Once I apply my concealer whether under eye or corrections I use this to blend. All I do is dab.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a true go to after the expensive brands. I saw some reviews on them on YouTube and decided to give them a try. I have not been disappointed and I would certainly recommend these.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for contouring, it blends effortlessly and its so soft. I have yet to have a bad brush from Real Techniques, I love them!</li>
    <li> great under eye concealer brush</li>
    <li> Love this brush for contouring. Like all Real Techniques brushes I&#x27;ve tried they all wash well and nearly never shed,same with this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for its price. I use it for contouring and works wonderfully. Love the quality, as with all my other real techniques brushes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I only now discovered this brush, after spending so much money on brand name one&amp;this works the best. Better than a few stippling brushes i own..Yes it is supposed to be used for contouring but I use it to apply liquid foundation and bb creams and I have to say it is awesome! It blends perfectly.. You won&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing this... Cristal Dookie.</li>
