<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a very cheap brush!!!Right when I opened package it fell apart.Will stick with Sigma</li>
    <li> This is a high quality little brush, it&#x27;s great to conceal blemishes!</li>
    <li> I love this small tapered blending brush for multiple uses.  I mainly use it to brush setting powder under my eyes and on my t-zone.  It&#x27;s soft and has firmly packed bristles.  I originally purchased it because the description mentioned that it&#x27;s good for glitter.  I haven&#x27;t tried it for that use yet, but by the look and feel of it, it would work well for applying loose glitter on the face and eyes.  It would be a bit too big to use for the eyelid- I was also thinking it would make a nice, large fluffy eyeshadow brush but I have small eyes, so it would be better for blending out eyeshadow under my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this brush.  I needed a new and better one than the one that comes with my UD Naked Palette.  This is definitely better.  The handle is long enough for just the right handling and angles you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and hold the eyeshawdow powder well. I used all type of shadows.  I really noticed the white tip because it allows me to accurately know how much shadow is on my brush.  Other brushes, I can never tell and end up having to learn with habit which shades not dabble in as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommend this mini tapered Kabuki brush.  I have not had the need to use it for concealer but it works very, very well with shadows!</li>
    <li> Great brush for eye shadow and small areas that need a smaller brush. Works great with all different products from liquid to powder.</li>
    <li> This is by far my new favorite brush. I usually need about 3 to 4 different brushes to do my eyes but this one was able to do it all. I was definitely impressed with the quality. If you are searching for a good blending brush this is definitely the one!</li>
    <li> So I am a great lover of the Beauty Junkees line of makeup brushes, and I own all the regular sized kabukis (round, flat, angled, and tapered).  I use them all - and I have an ample supply of higher end brushes to choose from: It Cosmetics, Sephora, Paula Begoun, etc.).  But I have to say, this tapered mini kabuki is my favorite now!  It&#x27;s great for under eye concealers, smoothing those areas like around your nose, mouth etc.  It&#x27;s just the right density, so it&#x27;s really lush, but it handles easily and holds and distributes product effectively.  I would say this has been elevated to the rank of &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34; in my collection - I use it every single day!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Great Quality ! I am always amazed by how soft this brand is !</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Love all their brushes. This one s great for applying concealer. No shedding. Good quality</li>
    <li> I have tried A LOT of makeup brushes-from drug store to high end. Beauty Junkee&#x27;s simply has THE BEST quality for the price. I would rec to anyone. They are sturdy and well made. No shedding. Clean like a dream-and most importantly-they apply your make up flawlessly. I&#x27;m obsessed. Thank you Beauty Junkees!</li>
    <li> this brush is super dense and really soft. for the price you can&#x27;t beat it because the quality is like any high end sigma brand truly love it</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to use with concealer. I&#x27;ve used brushes to apply concealer in the past, and all of them have left brush marks because the brush bristles are too soft and flexible. This brush has very firm thick bristles and applies concealer like a sponge on a stick. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The thickness of the handle is perfect for holding it comfortably and the plastic ring is perfect for holding the tip of the brush firmly to help make the perfect angles.</li>
    <li> I normally use my ring finger to blend my concealer under my eyes, but when I use this brush -- the concealer seems to whisk and blend right into my skin and I don&#x27;t have to dirty my finger.  It is very soft, but dense.  It&#x27;s just the right size for the inner corner or even in the edges of the nose.  I am so glad that I purchased this brush vs other higher end brushes -- it&#x27;s a great tool for a low price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best I have ever owned...and I have got a lot!  I will only be getting these brushes from this company from now on. Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality of the brush. I use it for blending spots of concealer, along with any under eye concealer. The bristles are very soft and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite brushes to use. I really like the tapered shape of the brush, and though I use it for concealer, I may try using it with eye shadow soon too. I can easily say that the quality went above and beyond my expectations, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It is good for setting concealer under eyes or contouring the nose and small areas. I was impressed with the quality of this brush. I will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush. Just the right size to use when concealing small areas. I highly recommend this brush and the company is very friendly as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Kabuki brushes! I have them in all shapes and sizes! They provide excellent coverage! The quality of the brushes are unheard of!</li>
    <li> great little brush...so far i&#x27;ve used it with cream concealer around my eyes and it did the job well in combination with round kabuki brush for loose powder foundation.</li>
    <li> This brush is nothing compared to their face brushes. The bristles are extremely plastic like and they look plastic like as well. it is also huge. Not meant to be a eye-shadow blending brush. The wand is huge as will and appears to be cheaply made.</li>
    <li> What a great idea for a brush.  These are great for dark circles.  I don&#x27;t see my dark circles anymore..and that is incredible!!!  This is a brush specifically designed for that delicate eye area....and it does the trick every time!!  There&#x27;s nothing like trying to use a large brush for the smaller contoured areas of the face.  Your brushes are very high quality, and I would recommend them to everyone!!!  These are just the best!!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed with the quality of these brushes. It&#x27;s extremely soft and there was no shedding of the bristles at all. Even some of my super expensive brushes shed. This brush is so affordable and doesn&#x27;t skimp on quality. Super friendly company, fast shipping, great service. I am not disappointed in my purchase at all and will be buying more. The brush applied my concealer better than my brushes that cost triple the price. I even cleaned the brush already and it&#x27;s just as soft as the day I got it! *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Awesome brush...great for blending my concealer under eye and get into hard to reach places around the eye. Definitely a new classic in my collection!</li>
    <li> I like to use this brush to apply concealer under my eyes. Works great!  I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it fell apart within a week of using it. However, I contacted Beauty Junkees and they sent me a new brush!  Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Great sturdy makeup brush. The bristle area is on the larger side so not something you can use for detailed stuff. The handle is very sturdy. Maybe a little too long for my taste.  I ordered this item because I received a promotional email.  I took advantage of the offer and am very satisfied.  I received it very quickly.  The company also called me to be sure I was satisfied.  WOW - that&#x27;s old school customer service and I love it!  Highly recommend Beauty Junkees!!</li>
    <li> This seems like a very well constructed brush.  I got a steal at $1, but worth much more.  May be as nice as Real Techniques...</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for my concealer. Works great, washes up nicely and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> it was broken when I received it. very disappointed</li>
    <li> This brush(tapered kabuki) is great for applying undereye concealer(I used Mac&#x27;s Pro Longwear)..enables me to get a more precise application than previous brushes used.  Customer Service was great too..first brush came broken and a new one was shipped out to me quickly..Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price. It got the job done but the silver part holding the brush to the stem was flimsy and wobbly.</li>
    <li> This brush is amzing for around the eyes . I will definitely be back for the full size one .</li>
    <li> Perfect size for around the eyes and for concealing.  I love the length of the handle. Love the feel of the bristles.</li>
    <li> The brush/bristles itself are of great quality, the manufacturing of the brush, not so much, because as I was pulling the brush from the packaging for the first time, it separated from the handle and required me to re-glue it in order to actually use it. Aside from that, the brush itself has been great for concealing dark under eye circles, which is mainly what I have been using it for.      UPDATE: best customer service! I am being sent a replacement brush despite mine still working.</li>
    <li> Very good for concealing -- good size and dense in fibers.</li>
    <li> I am beyond happy with this brush!  I can&#x27;t wait to order other brushes from this line.  The quality is great and so is the price point!  I was sick of loose brissels from my other brushes and don&#x27;t have that problem anymore!  It is soft and non irritating!!</li>
    <li> Great brush, but the seller will nag you over and over again for a review of the experience!  Love the brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I use it every day. No fall out, fibers stay soft. Beauty Junkies is awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. The quality is fantastic and the brush is the perfect brush for using concealer under my eyes. Thank you</li>
    <li> So far I like the brush. I use it to apply my under eye concealer. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the concealer, but this brush makes it look great ever time. I cannot wait to try it with a better concealer. The brush is very soft and I have not noticed any shedding.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite go-to brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(edited on July 14, 2015)  I wanted to come back and add to my review about this brush.  I have been using this brush everyday since I purchased it about 9 months ago.  When I wash it, it still looks brand new.  I use this brush for highlighting under the eyes, the bridge of my nose, my chin, cheekbone, and forehead.  I used to have a hard time blending during highlighting and contouring. This brush makes it easy,  I have learned the technique of rolling the brush to blend outward.  The tapered head is perfect for this.  I plan to purchase a whole like of Beauty Junkees brushes!</li>
    <li> Perfect, I recommend...</li>
    <li> The bristles are so incredibly soft. Coverage is great. Customer service is good.</li>
    <li> i use this as an eyeshadow brush and i love it! beauty junkies brushes are so soft and dense, the best part... they dont shed! i highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I used to only ever use brushes by Hourglass - but my new Beauty Junkees brushes are a total dupe!  They blend well, and pick up the product wonderfully for application! A++  I especially love the mini tapered blending brush, because it&#x27;s very versatile for blending and highlighting.</li>
    <li> Arrived within a week!  Nice product!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes from Beauty Junkees. Pleasantly surprised at how well their brushes blend and feel. The tapered brush is perfect for applying concealer around the eyes and nose. Washed and dried well, too. Kept its shape and feel!</li>
    <li> This brush is nice and soft. Its good for blending around the eyes and the nose area!&lt;br /&gt;I like it : )</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I order this sooner!  I am a Makeup Artist and soon to start reviews on my YouTube Channel.  Needless to say I am constantly looking for Holy Grail items.  This tapered kabuki is perfect for under eye concealer!  I have tried many things including beauty blenders and larger tapered kabuki&#x27;s but nothing fit the undereye and inner corner like this!  Also the pricing is awesome and the brush is high quality.  Buy any one of the Beauty Junkee brushes as a comparison to one of your others and you will be amazed at the performance and quality.  Their brushes do not shed which is normal for brushes to shed a little...these don&#x27;t shed at all!</li>
    <li> This brand is one of the best brands that I have ever used. I love the brush I use it for contouring around my nose and applying consealer. I am very happy with the product no fall out and feels like the right weight</li>
    <li> This brush is great to apply a bright highlight color into the inner corner of your eye. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have quite a few of this company&#x27;s face brushes, this is my first mini and I am not disappointed. As with the face brushes, bristles, hairs, whatever are soft yet dense which makes them really nice for applying shadows.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up the tapered and I&#x27;m back for more now I am honestly that pleased with their products.</li>
    <li> Great little brush. I love using it for concealing under the eye. It&#x27;s also great for around the nose area. I imagine it would great for any concealing needs.</li>
    <li> High quality brush. I was stunned at the softness and the quality due to the great price! I&#x27;m beyond impressed by this brand and will be purchasing more in the future. If you are a true beauty junkie you must have this brush, it is a go to for me.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, love this brush!  It is super soft and perfect for blending and highlighting.  It had replaced my other, more expensive, blending brush!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush.  It&#x27;s super soft and is perfect for concealer.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Another great brush for such an affordable price.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times as a concealer but the bristles are sturdy yet soft enough to use for concealer under the eye.  It&#x27;s definitely comparable or even better than my MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, fast delivery!</li>
