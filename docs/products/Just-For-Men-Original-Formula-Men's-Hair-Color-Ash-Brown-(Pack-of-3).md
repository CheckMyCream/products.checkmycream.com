      <li>Quick fix for graying hair.  </li>
      <li>Let me calm ur start up anxieties.  </li>
      <li>But, unless you use it more frequently, it won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
      <li>I have some mild itching on the first day that goes away.  </li>
      <li>The shipment was very fast, I am trying out the product, I thought it was the one that I bought before that</li>
      <li>I boght this item thinking it is a shampoo, as the name says, but i found out that it is a normal hair dye, nothing special, and it could give u an alergy too.</li>
      <li>really!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the first time</li>
      <li>Best product to cover grey hair for men in few months.</li>
      <li>Just keep wet tissues handy for the dye that runs off the hair(expect</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions on how to apply so all hairs are covered, its not difficult or rocket science.</li>
      <li>It seems intimidating at first to use because of this fear created about the dye running all over from the sink to your forehead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than ten years.</li>
      <li>so if this is the first time you are using it, I would recommend buying one in the store first.  </li>
      <li>Trying it first recommended because it does cause some people to have reactions.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff, really makes you look younger.</li>
      <li>It is very simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This product is good only when ALL YOUR HAIR IS GREY.</li>
      <li>Works well, easy to apply and last for a reasonable time.  </li>
      <li>Vaseline borders are recommended, but you(huge baldspots  may need them-I don&#x27;t know) really can avoid it.</li>
      <li>Its a whole lot simpler than it appears.</li>
      <li>However, the formula is very drippy, despite their \\&quot;non-drip\\&quot; statement.    </li>
      <li>As a first time user when I applied the hair color instantly, I lost almost 700/800 hairs in 5 minutes and my hands were full with lost hairs.</li>
      <li>I also tried other products and Just for Men is the better product.</li>
      <li>Mixed with dark brown, it gives a good color.  </li>
      <li>high school reunions/weddings..</li>
      <li>Its also easy to remove from other surfaces(just</li>
      <li>People think I&#x27;m so young now, haha.</li>
      <li>Having this shipped to me every 2 months is better than having to ask my wife to pick up some at the grocery store every few weeks.</li>
      <li>Am able to save a few bucks (compared with Target and Walmart) by buying in bulk like this.</li>
      <li>It works but not as well as the new type that is out in the the stores today.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m 22 but in my family, you start getting salt &amp; pepper hair at a very young age.</li>
      <li>It is as easy as a thorough shampoo, letting it sit for a few minutes and then rinsing.  </li>
      <li>I have used it multiple times and each time I spend more time trying to get our the stains for my ears and neck when the thing just slides down your hair onto your skin.    </li>
      <li>Be very careful and it dyes your skin too if you leave it too long (more than 5 minutes maybe).</li>
      <li>At least for me, it gives a more natural color and texture to hair.  </li>
      <li>There really needs to be a buyer beware clause that the product will stain virtually any surface with which it has contact, and its complete removal is not possible.  </li>
      <li>It can only be &#x27;removed&#x27; by staining over it which really isn&#x27;t a removal at all.</li>
      <li>It does drip a lot, so I try not to apply too much, and soak of any extra liquid on the sides with tissue paper.  </li>
      <li>Also, use the cream on the skin near the hair lines, to prevent the dye from dying the skin.  </li>
      <li>The color has natural looks.</li>
      <li>Washed it out after the recommended 5 mins and made a real (but not obviously noticeable) change.  </li>
      <li>Old... not the non drip type shampoo.</li>
      <li>so I am kind of addicted to coloring it now.</li>
      <li>Dye is easy to mix (pour one small bottle into another) and not that runny.  </li>
      <li>Both actually work for me, but the black is my overall better color.</li>
      <li>Our main concern is always skin safety and of course proper cover-up of grays.</li>
      <li>you directly comb it through, this one has to be applied differently.</li>
      <li>Apparently, he likes it.</li>
      <li>your wall might get dye if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Product works great.</li>
    <li> This is a pack of 3... so if this is the first time you are using it, I would recommend buying one in the store first.  Read the directions, and then... if it works great for you... BUY THIS PACK!  You&#x27;re going to save!!!    Trying it first recommended because it does cause some people to have reactions.  Also, use the cream on the skin near the hair lines, to prevent the dye from dying the skin.  Black is better for me, because I have a really dark brown hair (in the sunlight), but otherwise, it&#x27;s black... and the dark brown just barely highlights.  Both actually work for me, but the black is my overall better color.</li>
    <li> I have been using it since years.  I used to use Men&#x27;s Choice, but switched to this product.  At least for me, it gives a more natural color and texture to hair.  You can also shampoo the hair immediately after using it, so the dye is not left in the hair to stain the towels and pillows.   It does drip a lot, so I try not to apply too much, and soak of any extra liquid on the sides with tissue paper.  All hair dyes cause allergy over time in some people. I have some mild itching on the first day that goes away.  THE LONGER YOU LEAVE IT IN, THE DARKER WOULD BE THE COLOR.  If you leave it longer, that also decreases fading of color between applications.   I usually leave it in for at least 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, stays on, never fades. Been using it for over 5 years</li>
    <li> I have been using this the past few months and it works well.  I had jet black hair and the coverage is almost non-noticeable. The only downside is because of my black hair the gray shows up very fast so I am kind of addicted to coloring it now.</li>
    <li> Product works well and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The shipment was very fast, I am trying out the product, I thought it was the one that I bought before that you directly comb it through, this one has to be applied differently.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my dad. The color looks real black and natural. You may notice that the color is changing to dark brown side a little bit after two months. But, unless you use it more frequently, it won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied, thank you!</li>
    <li> Never dyed my hair before.  Finally felt like I had to do something so bought this after it was recommended by some friends.  Was leery due to the negative reviews.  My experience was good.  You do need to grease your hairline to prevent dye stains to the skin.  You do need to use gloves.  Dye is easy to mix (pour one small bottle into another) and not that runny.  Was viscous enough to work into hair and not drip.  Washed it out after the recommended 5 mins and made a real (but not obviously noticeable) change.  Not sure how long it lasts as only just used it.  Am happy and will continue using.</li>
    <li> Better wear plastic gloves, this stuff will stain your hands and floor!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Has a slight different feel than the prior product/packing. No change in using process. Nice shampoo based. Need to use only half or less each application as my hair is very short.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using petroleum jelly on the skin around the hair line to avoid staining of the skin prior to application.</li>
    <li> I used this only a couple of times.It caused a lots of itching around my head.So i had to stop using immediately.I would like to return this.</li>
    <li> What can I say...I am vain!  Say what you will but grey hair doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  Having this shipped to me every 2 months is better than having to ask my wife to pick up some at the grocery store every few weeks.</li>
    <li> Like it would see the Quality when I use</li>
    <li> Just for Men is a great product. I had about 25 percent grey hairs, so I wanted to get rid of them for an event.  I will be a regular reuser, just about once every two months for me(only a handful returned by then)  Us men do not have many types of health and beauty products to choose from.  It is very simple and easy to use. Read and follow the instructions, I read the other reviews and did not understand how people could not successfully use this product.      Do not leave the product in your hair longer than instructed. Itis filled with good things for your hair unlike woman&#x27;s dies and bleaches.   Follow the instructions on how to apply so all hairs are covered, its not difficult or rocket science. It is as easy as a thorough shampoo, letting it sit for a few minutes and then rinsing.  Its well worth a little over six bucks to look ten-fifteen younger.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to apply and last for a reasonable time.  Use petroleum jelly to keep the dye sticking to your skin.</li>
    <li> I like that I can hide my grays with this. A nice product to have for guys who just like their hair to look good.</li>
    <li> It only takes less than 3 minutes. The color has natural looks. Be very careful and it dyes your skin too if you leave it too long (more than 5 minutes maybe).</li>
    <li> I am using this product for couple of years from now.  Wonderful product, easy to apply, color stays for long enough.  Out of my 2 years of experience Amazon is the best place to buy this product under bargain price.  I will definitely recommend you all to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than ten years. I also tried other products and Just for Men is the better product. It is easy to use and gives you good results. The product has also been improved over the years. It is easy to rinse clean and the stains on skin are easy to remove. It doesn&#x27;t stain pillows when hair is dry, but it is recommended to use designated towel to dry the hair and use something to cover the pillow after the coloring.</li>
    <li> This hair color works well and is quick.  It does splatter, so be careful where you apply this item.  It only takes 5 minutes, so I stay near the tub and dont leave till its time to wash it out.</li>
    <li> This product does dye your hair to the color you want.    However, the formula is very drippy, despite their \\&quot;non-drip\\&quot; statement.    I have used it multiple times and each time I spend more time trying to get our the stains for my ears and neck when the thing just slides down your hair onto your skin.    I would not recommend this product.  Get a hair dye with a thicker formula.</li>
    <li> This product is good only when ALL YOUR HAIR IS GREY. In my case I had one third grey and after using it I noticed the grey hair increasing rapidly until it covered almost all my head.    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for use by those whose hair is NOT ALL GREY.</li>
    <li> works as advertised. i&#x27;m 22 but in my family, you start getting salt &amp; pepper hair at a very young age. this worked nicely. careful rinsing it in the shower though. your wall might get dye if you&#x27;re not careful. it will appear a few minutes after before you realize it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for couple of years. Wonderful product, easy to apply, color stays for long enough. I will recommend you all to try.</li>
    <li> Use this stuff to hide the grays.  Works well at first but then as your hair grows and time passes you can notice the colored hairs turning (in my case) turning from black to brown.  Unless you plan on using this every 2 weeks which I doubt, this thing is great for short term.. you know high school reunions/weddings..etc.  Otherwise be glad you have gray hairs instead of no hair.</li>
    <li> This is a warning to anyone who plan to purchase this item from Amazon.  If you look at the pictures and the description, it is shampoo-in and with no-drip formula.  For some unknown reason, none of the stores in my neighborhood (CVS,Target and Safeway) stock this product. I was thrilled to find it in Amazon. When the package arrived, it was the original formula version of this hair dye which is available everywhere. I can&#x27;t return them because it is considered personal health product.  Beware!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and find it very easy to use and I get the results I want.</li>
    <li> Best product to cover grey hair for men in few months.</li>
    <li> been using it for years,easy to use good color blends in great looks natural I&#x27;m 58 and don&#x27;t want my head to look like it</li>
    <li> Am able to save a few bucks (compared with Target and Walmart) by buying in bulk like this. I find that I have to leave it in my hair a bit longer than 5 minutes to get all the gray hairs (maybe 7-8 minutes), although the instructions say not to leave it longer than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it, I thought that it was going to be a big mess, but I find that there is no dripping or splatter at all as long as I do it carefully. Do be careful, though, about getting it on your forehead because it takes a bit of scrubbing to get the black dye off it.</li>
    <li> Mixed with dark brown, it gives a good color.  Quick fix for graying hair.  It lasts about 3 weeks, by the time the gray hair grows in.</li>
    <li> I boght this item thinking it is a shampoo, as the name says, but i found out that it is a normal hair dye, nothing special, and it could give u an alergy too.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. It seems intimidating at first to use because of this fear created about the dye running all over from the sink to your forehead. Let me calm ur start up anxieties.  1) The gloves are provided in the kit- use them.  2) Vaseline borders are recommended, but you(huge baldspots  may need them-I don&#x27;t know) really can avoid it. Just keep wet tissues handy for the dye that runs off the hair(expect a couple of spots maybe on forehead and below sideburns). Now the dye solution is thick and not runny so its not really a stain hazard at all. Its also easy to remove from other surfaces(just keep towel or tissue handy no need to cover the basin etc etc).   3) After 5minutes it showers of easy. Just run the water a lot through the hair then shampoo.    Its a whole lot simpler than it appears. When I read the instruction I almost thought I had to cover all exposed surfaces - really! just keep some tissues and get on with it.</li>
    <li> Old... not the non drip type shampoo. It works but not as well as the new type that is out in the the stores today.</li>
    <li> My dad let me order this for him. Apparently, he likes it.</li>
    <li> hard to find on the shelf&#x27;s in stores. sold out allot. works perfect no drip formula. three in one box, not three separate boxes.</li>
    <li> OMG! People think I&#x27;m so young now, haha. I should have used this when I was 30! I love the color and It&#x27;s a very nice match to my eyebrows. I used a fine tooth comb to distribute the color and the gloves it came with fit my hands easily. There was almost no smell and the smell was gone after I washed it out. It took 2 applications to really get my hair solid black, but I waited 2 weeks to reapply it. Everyone I know loves the look and some even wonder why I look different. It&#x27;s amazing how women really want you to have a nice hair color. I bought 3 packs of these and got the free shipping. I figure 1 time per month will do it, so I&#x27;m set for most of this year now.</li>
    <li> Like the product but they need to include better gloves.  Why not put better fitting gloves.  These are the cheapest crap I have ever seen.  So buy a box of gloves too.</li>
    <li> Subscription service for the Just for Men Shampoo-In Hair Color, Real Black 55, 1 application (Pack of 3)works fine. Convenient and cheaper than going to the store.</li>
    <li> This is the best produce ever I had for coloring the hair I love it! Thank you just for men shampoo!</li>
    <li> works as advertised.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  It seems its power to stain everything has increased.  It&#x27;s stained my leather couch, hardwood floors, washing machine exterior, bathroom cabinets, walls, towels, fingers.  There really needs to be a buyer beware clause that the product will stain virtually any surface with which it has contact, and its complete removal is not possible.  It can only be &#x27;removed&#x27; by staining over it which really isn&#x27;t a removal at all.</li>
    <li> Kind of shocking? As a first time user when I applied the hair color instantly, I lost almost 700/800 hairs in 5 minutes and my hands were full with lost hairs. I got scared? The color coverage is as good as 65% ?  I&#x27;m not sure I will ever  use it again? Something must be wrong with this product?</li>
    <li> Takes a little experience and do it in the shower. Try to keep the stuff off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It will come off but if you get sloppy with the application you might have better results with Horny Goat Weed.</li>
    <li> Works ok. A bit messy to apply. Stains easily so be careful spilling it.  Does not last that long but enough to get to next cut.</li>
    <li> does not last very long only 2 weeks from my experience not 4-6 weeks as advertised the gloves it comes with are pretty lame and cheap also they could have done better with that.</li>
    <li> I love that it thickens the hair. I recently bleached and dyed my hair with blue so you can only imagine the struggle I went through to achieve the color that I want. It&#x27;s not the first time but when you have all sorts of chemicals on your head it comes with dandruff and other scalp problems. Anyway, so I bought this and it worked really great for me.</li>
    <li> Ten years younger since that product touch my head!&lt;br /&gt;Easy use, shipping on time, cheap and valuable item!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, really makes you look younger.</li>
    <li> I received this free product from Smiley360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.    The hair color was used by my husband and he absolutely loved it. Our main concern is always skin safety and of course proper cover-up of grays. He has tried a couple brands of hair color and most of them caused skin irritation and redness. With Just for Men, there were no complains of skin irritation. His grays are all covered up and last up to two three weeks. He is also looking forward to trying Just For Men Beard and Mustache color.</li>
