<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I actually already have an Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover that I purchased a few weeks ago.  This order was for a gift for a co-worker.  This is an amazing product and I cannot believe how much comes off my feet each and every time I use it.  My co-worker was thrilled to receive her Emjoi and thinks it is wonderful also.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and now I will be sharing this with all my friends and family. It&#x27;s too good a product to wait till Dec 25; I&#x27;m having Christmas in July. This does what it says it can do.</li>
    <li> The Micro-Pedi is a callus remover. It can be used to help smooth and remove rough, dry, and callused skin. The micro-mineral roller is effective, gentle, and easy to use. After trying so many other tools, I finally came found one that gets the job done! I am a nurse and spend many hours a day on my feet. My feet take a real beating! They were rough and calloused. Emjoi is easy to use. My feet are now soft and beautiful thanks to Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Micro-Pedi can be used by anyone with calluses or rough skin on their feet. The micro-mineral roller spins gently and effectively buffs away rough, dry, callused skin. Just hold the Micro-Pedi to your dry, rough, callused skin on your feet. Let the micro-mineral roller help to smooth away dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a few minutes once or twice a week for smooth feet! This is a real find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-17-13</li>
    <li> it works great.  i take the batteries out everytime, which adds inconvenience, but is better than getting to in a week and the batteries are dead already.</li>
    <li> Rollers run down fast but my feet look great.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> Works great for the price. Good tool to use in between pedicures.  Easy to use and gentle. Feet are smooth and soft after use.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm. Feet were smooth as ever and calluses easily removed. So easy to use. Saves a trip to nail salon to get a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Dont need any other products. Just this and some lotion. No more useless ped egg. This is the only thing that worjs for me</li>
    <li> This little gadget is terrific. If I don&#x27;t take care of them, my feet get crackly with dry/dead skin. This really keeps my feet smooth with very little effort.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for years, and this is a gift for a relative.  It worked so well for her that she decided to give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I already owned one of these. Bought two more as Christmas gifts. Recipients love theirs! Smooth operation, battery lasts long times, and does an excellent job! Men and women can use these. Be careful not to press too hard or too long in one spot - they can go a little too close and leave skin a bit tender.</li>
    <li> If you have rough spots on your feet, (and who doesn&#x27;t) this is a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;Works well&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> Just gave this to my wife for Christmas, and let me tell you, we&#x27;re happy campers. Wife is in her late 20&#x27;s and has pretty dried up heels. I tried it one her this morning, for about 10 minutes on each heel and the amount of dry skin that this little thing is able to remove is amazing. We got the battery operated 1 speed model and it&#x27;s enough power for such task. Wife is happy with her present !</li>
    <li> I really love the micro-pedi.  It does its job perfectly and I&#x27;ve so far had no issues whatsoever with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and when it did such a great job on my feet; now smooth for the first time in decades, I gave it to my son, then purchased another for myself. He also is very happy with his &#x27;new&#x27; feet.</li>
    <li> I have tried several pedi-type devices, and this is by far the best.  I was considering Clarisonic&#x27;s pedicure system when I purchased the Emjoi, and I am glad I changed my mind!  Excellent results and several dollars cheaper! Feet are smooth as ever.  Love it!</li>
    <li> you know what i like about this ,its really light on the hands good colors to choose from ,thnk god it works for the price will buy more products from  emijoi.</li>
    <li> I so loved this machine that I bought one for all my friends for Christmas this year. My only regret is that the rollers don&#x27;t last very long so now we&#x27;re all invested in buying more and more rollers.</li>
    <li> I wish they had this device years ago - I would have saved myself so much money at the nail salon.  The original  blades wore out pretty fast &amp; have now been replaced a couple of times.  Other than that, a good product.</li>
    <li> Takes the dead skin right off quickly and effortlessly!  So much easier than using a pumice!  Prepping my feet (at home) for Spring Break has never been so easy.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this callus remover to everyone. Remover takes off the toughest callous out there because I had them.  I have baby feet now!!  Can&#x27;t wait for sandals. . .</li>
    <li> I have had problems with rough feet for years.  This really smoothes them out well.  You will not regret this if you have callus&#x27; to get rid of.</li>
    <li> This was ok.  Not great but ok.  It works ok like i said.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again and I&#x27;m sure there is something better on the market.</li>
    <li> Love this callus remover! I am obsessed about keeping my feet nice and smooth and this callus remover does the trick. I bought it several months ago and I am still using the original buffer cartridge that came with it. Does a nice job of smoothing my feet, especially now that we are in the colder, dryer months of the year.</li>
    <li> I love my Emjoi so I bought another one as a gift for a friend.  It&#x27;s a great callus remover!</li>
    <li> Does not hurt, works great and would definitely buy again. May Ned some of the more coarse rollers but what it comes with Will work I think with regular use.  Glad to have this</li>
    <li> This callus remover is amazing.  I use it twice a week and my feet stay smooth.  I will be ordering the course rollers too.</li>
    <li> Seen other products that are more expensive, but this one works just as well.  My feet look amazing and so pretty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but wish I would have gotten the chargeable one, one I go to the next foot it&#x27;s already dual and slows as soon as it touches the skin but overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> This works surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good, but after a year the roller won&#x27;t turn when you touch it to the skin.  Sounds like gears are stripped.  Have since read that this is a common problem.</li>
    <li> Get it, don&#x27;t hesitate. It does exactly what it says it will. Great price and fast shipping. I recommend to al my friends.</li>
    <li> I love it.  The only thing is:  I am following the instructions to the T.  It says not to use it for more than 2 to 3 seconds at a time.  That is not very long, but as long as you are not in a hurry, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I have only used this once but was very impressed with how easy it was to use and the immediate results.  Just add the batteries, remove the protective guard and go.  You can control the intensity by pivoting the head.  More vertical the higher the intensity, for example.  It removed the dead skin and callouses and left smooth skin behind.  Definitely use a towel or something to catch the debris.  Saw results right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with thick skin on my feet. I would get pedicures once a week just to help remove callus on my feet. I use it with Be Natural Callus Remover and the wide \\&quot;feet grader\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t remember the name. Not the one you can get at the drugstores. I bought it on Amazon. All three have SAVED me so much $money$. I&#x27;m obsessed! It&#x27;s worth every penny. The only thing you must buy extra batteries since it uses a lot of battery. But, worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It keeps my feet soft and callous-free during the summer months, reducing the need for a pedicure if you are on a tight budget as I am! It also works well on my 86 yr old mother who is in an assisted care facility and there is not always time, resources and transportation to get her to an appointment. She loved the pampering by her daughter, and I loved spending the quality time with my mom, so it works out great all the way around!</li>
    <li> This Callus remover worked okay.  I wasn&#x27;t blown away.  Would look into something a little cheaper if looking to buy.</li>
    <li> for quick smoothing on barely cracked feet it&#x27;s great. If you need an industrial strength sander you need to go to home depot.</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected. Well made and very easy to use. Wish the refills would last longer.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough power.</li>
    <li> Amazing results I saw it  being demonstrated on QVC. When I received it in  the mail I was amazed at how great it made my feet feel.</li>
    <li> It is underpowered.  The motor is weak.  When pressure is applied to the dead skin the roller stops.  Not reccommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hillbilly at heart, so whenever I can, I go barefoot. Needless to say, over the years I developed calluses on the heels &amp; balls of my foot and the side of my big toes.  My calluses where so bad, they&#x27;d snag my sheets! This Micro-Pedi is fantastic. It works kind of like a sander on wood :-). My feet have never looked or felt better.  I highly recommend this product, for I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! My heels are never bad, that&#x27;s because as soon as I get out of the shower, I massage Bath And Body Works True Blue Spa Shea Butter Foot Cream into my feet and I never go barefoot, not even around inside the house but.....wearing sandals every day in the summer Imy heels will sometimes get a little scaly. I&#x27;ll use my Emjoi and then they look perfect again.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Two uses and my feet are smooth as silk.  I do recommend the super coarse roller if you have thick callouses.  I bought it after trying the blue roller which worked well on thinner areas, but I felt like I needed the big guns for my heels.</li>
    <li> my wife and I have been researching this product for awhile before we finally decided to give it a try.  I am so glad she bought it because it is the best foot treatment ever. I have had no issues with it and love what it does for my feet. I do wish the roller brushes lasted a bit longer because after 3 uses its pretty much shot. However, we both prefer this device to a pumice stone.</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there to get your feet pedicure smooth in just one use! Amazing! Blows the Ped-egg out of the water!</li>
    <li> I had a lot invested in this product,reading all of the great reviews written about it. When it arrived I whipped it out and went to work on my clean dry calloused feet and was stunned about how much dry skin that came off when I worked the gadget on my foot. After a couple of attempts my nasty crazy looking feet looked so much better. I think its a great investment and if you&#x27;re on the fence with it I can tell you, get it.  It does take a couple of times to rid yourself completely of callouses because they are built up over a prolonged span of time. For the price of basic pedicure you can get a great well made gadget that actually does what it promises by getting rid of your callouses with less hassle and less money.</li>
    <li> Love this!! It really works yall!!!!!</li>
    <li> Emjoi micro-pedi does exactly as advertised. It removes callused skin from feet. My feet have never felt or looked so good. Can&#x27;t wait till I can wear sandals again.</li>
    <li> I Wish i had not got this thing.  Wasted  money.  It barely works.  Barely.  You can see a bit of dust...old skin....come off.  If yu want to waste money then buy it.  OR  Buy a PUMICE  for a buck that DOES work !!!</li>
    <li> This works great! Now I have soft smooth feet! No soaking required. Can use any time. Would highly recommend for beautiful summer sandal season!</li>
    <li> Best product of this kind I have ever used.  You will not be disappointed with the results you achieve.  I was so impressed I purchased one for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I never wear shoes, and my feet were a mess.  This Callus Remover is absolutely the best thing in the world.  I am so glad I bought one.  Now, between pedicures, I have pretty feet.  Hooray!</li>
    <li> effortless and effective, but not for removing thick callus.  Best for polishing off the rough edges after a file is used.</li>
    <li> My feet callus easily as I love to go barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;While I love an occasional pedicure,&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to go every three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This machine easily keeps the calluses off my feet.</li>
    <li> After using the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover my expectations were meet, my feet were soft and smooth with very little effort on my part.</li>
    <li> Loved it!!  Best thing ever!! I have tried many creams and tools but nothing compares!! I definitely recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Love it ... Has made a huge difference for me. Sugges the extra coarse rollers if you have problem feet.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective, easy to use. Good for a quick &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34;. It works well for routine maintenance as well . Happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> I tried it as soon as I received it and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;This will save me alot of money now that I don&#x27;t have to go&lt;br /&gt;and get pedicures to keep my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi is one of the best products I have used, It does a great job, and so easy to use. My feet look great, would recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. It is fast and easy. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, go for it.</li>
    <li> I love this. It does make a mess, so you should use it on a towel, or in the tub. Works great.</li>
    <li> does a professional job</li>
    <li> I have a big callus problem and the Micro-Pedi does a beautiful job of removing the callus effortlessly.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi is the perfect tool for getting your feet ready for summer sandals. It is sturdy enough to take care of all the rough spots, yet gentle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft like a baby !&lt;br /&gt;Fast as lightning and very easy to use at home or away !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I would highly recommend its use. Easy to use and terrific results better than you could imagine. Pedicure maintenance is a breeze!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. It isn&#x27;t very powerful at all. It more or less buffers your foot. I get regular pedicures and was hoping this product would help me go a few weeks between, but was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this callus remover! It is easy to use and totally effective. Use on dry skin only. Do not press hard.&lt;br /&gt;Give one to everyone you love. :)</li>
    <li> I originally saw this on one of the home shopping channels and was curious.  I ordered it from Amazon and after letting it sit for a week or two decided to try it.  It&#x27;s gentle and non-abrasive and very easy to clean.  I love it and will be sure to tell my friends and family all about it.</li>
