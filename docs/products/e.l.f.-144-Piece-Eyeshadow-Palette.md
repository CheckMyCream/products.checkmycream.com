<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely perfect, all the colors and the condition that it came in, I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Upset that one of the shadows is basically empty before I even got to open the box. It is very cute though and I won&#x27;t let that horrible mistake affect my oveeall opinion of the makeup.</li>
    <li> I really love this palette. The colors are beautiful and they are very pigmented. And for the price why not?</li>
    <li> I was worried it was going to come broken, but it was perfect, arrived on time. There was one black color broken but thank goodness it didnt leave a mess, easy clean up &amp; still have the majority of that color there. Colors are pretty good for how affordable this palette is. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and purchased this nutral pallet. I&#x27;m going to be honest with you and say, the shimmer eyeshadows were just absolutely beautiful!!!!!! So pigmented like make up geek foil shadows and even more pigmented with a wet brush, I&#x27;m going to transfer them to my z pallet.The mattes were beautiful as well some are buildable very pretty colors !! some were chalky and really just a waste which were all the matte white shadows.You will notice that there are doubles 2 or 3 of the same eyeshadow but I was happy about that bc they are so beautiful.I also noticed watching makeup geek swatch videos that you will find a few makeup geek dupes.If you just use your imagination this can make beautiful looks.I will be buying this again when I need too elf probably stepped up and made the formula better again n the case is stronger again did more durable. You will need good eye primer staying power ok.</li>
    <li> Great colors with great pigmentation</li>
    <li> Pigmentation is ok. Would only recommend this product to people that are starting off with makeup and want to play around with eyeshadows as well as experiment with neutral warm colors.</li>
    <li> One of the colors was damaged but the rest where fine</li>
    <li> Nothing was messed up when it came. The eyeshadows are beautiful and many don&#x27;t even require primer. I&#x27;ll be using this a lot</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase for anyone who is picky about their cosmetics, or who enjoys having a wide selection of colors to choose from.  The reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because some of the colors were broken when I opened the box.  I expect some flaking-this is not flaking.  Big chunks were broken off and lying at the bottom of the palette.  As these are not full size portions, I lost almost half of several colors.  The palette contains mattes, pearls, frosts, and shimmers of each shade.  I am absolutely thrilled with the colors.  I would recommend this-just expect that not all of the colors will be intact when you receive it.</li>
    <li> I love this Palette I ordered it on a Saturday and it came that Monday in great shape none of my colors were broken or damaged.</li>
    <li> arrived in total mess and as soon as I opened the box I had to throw it away sine the colors were massed and the quality is very poor don&#x27;t buy this product you will then tell me thank you for writing this comments....</li>
    <li> So I bought this for myself. My main concern was that the eyeshadows broke and mixed together and overall make a huge mess. That&#x27;s not the case. The eyeshadows LOOK okay. I haven&#x27;t tried it on yet. It came in time. But the plastic case cover has shattered. It&#x27;s bothersome but I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s worth the hassle sending back.    UPDATE 1/12/14    It&#x27;s been about a week and I love it. A few colors stick more than others which can be frustrating. I&#x27;d suggest to not trust this product without primer. Primer, along with a setting spray helps the colors last all day and I love it. It gives you a wide variety of neutral colors to choose from and you&#x27;re able to create different looks. In this case, a little doesn&#x27;t go a long way. I find myself slighting having to pack on the product. But, it&#x27;s an amazing deal for the price. My 4 star rating stays the same. Only real complaints is the damage the product came in. Good luck, and I hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I really love it! It comes out perfectly üòç</li>
    <li> I LOVE the colors in this palette, BUT not only were the darkest colors broken when they arrived, the case itself was broken...as if someone had tossed it around very roughly.  I think this item needs to be boxed and padded differently, like with LOTs of bubble wrap.  I wanted to love, but never got the chance.  I returned it...if it hadn&#x27;t been broken, I&#x27;m sure my review would be much different.</li>
    <li> This palette is great. The colors are very pigmented. The only downside was that one of my colors were broken, probably due to shipping, and the pieces of the eyeshawdow were scattered onto the other colors. I feel like it could have been packaged better for shipping. But other then that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Buy it Buy it I love it I going to buy a another one I first had got the neutral .and I love it good</li>
    <li> Honestly the best makeup item iv&#x27;e EVER bought. i didn&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews and i&#x27;m so glad that i didn&#x27;t because i am in love with pallet i can do whatever eye look i want and there is matte and shimmer shades so you have options on the look you want.</li>
    <li> This could of been great but, it arrived completely broken.  Not only was the makeup broken and all over but, the case was also broken and the package looked like it was already opened.</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing! Well worth $20 for 144 colors. The colors are pretty well pigmented also. Unlike others, I received my palette unbroken. This should be a must have for anybody who loves makeup!</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect for people who like to keep the eye makeup light. I have used this everyday since I got it. So many different shades and finishes its wonderful. Best thing I got so far.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these colors. They look amazing on and they are pretty good quality for the price. I was extremely upset though when the package arrived and 5 eye shadows were ruined. The damage is the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> I love elf products but already knew some of the matte colors don&#x27;t give you a lot of coverage. I still love all the neautral shades and some are a little glittery and are very pretty. So many to choose from havent even used a quarter of them yet!</li>
    <li> Love all of these colors! Pigments are nice and a good mix of matte and sparkly shades. Will last me forever!</li>
    <li> ok kinda s***ty quality</li>
    <li> elf cosmetics are really nice worth the money</li>
    <li> Love these colors! So bright and long lasting</li>
    <li> Two of the colors were broken out when I received it and there&#x27;s not enough pigment in the colors.</li>
    <li> THIS PALETTE IS AN AMAZING VALUE FOR THE MONEY! THE COLORS ARE RICH AND VERY FROM A LIGHT COVERAGE SHADE TO A HEAVIER DEEPER COVERAGE!</li>
    <li> Good variety and colors! I am bummed so many colors are almost exactly the same. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> So many great colors!</li>
    <li> I received this product faster than shipping date. The palette came in one piece with no damage and very nicely packaged. Everything was beautiful. I am looking forward to using this beautiful palette all the time. It was all around a great investment.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t really show the best color when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed it appears to fade after a hour of  wearing it and I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived in good condition, only 2 of the eyeshadows had popped out.</li>
    <li> love the color choices! only down side is when it came in a few colors had come out of the tray and broke mixing colors with the others</li>
    <li> This is worth the price. I love this for trying new looks! Great product!</li>
    <li> i am an &amp;#34;elfette&amp;#34; all the way, this palette isn&#x27;t available on elf&#x27;s website coz it&#x27;s been discontinued, they have an earth tone (has burgundy/forest green/a kind of hodgepodge mix etc), &amp; a brights palette available but no neutral unless u get the smaller palettes, but anyways I feel fortunate to have snagged this palette! The cover arrived a little scratched, but none of the colors were pulverized which I had worried about after reading the reviews that maybe it was would arrive damaged. I&#x27;m thankful just the cover had a few scratches! Elf is a cruelty free brand which is so gr8, I&#x27;m 1 of their biggest fans, this will not disappoint loyal &amp;#34;elfettes&amp;#34; (elf fans), I have made it my tentative goal to try all 144 shades at least once. Soooo many colors, some are close to other shades like almost repeats but not quite. I can&#x27;t imagine what it must have taken to come up w 144 unique neutral colors. Every shade of brown, beige, cream, peach, grey, charcoal et al. is represented in this palette. It is huge! The pans aren&#x27;t baby, they are actually just as big if not a tad bigger than Coastal Scents/BH type 88 palettes (theirs are round). The colors are so pigmented, I wish I had discovered this b4 I spent a bunch of money on Coastal Scents Revealed 1 &amp; 2; &amp; all of the UD Nakeds franchise (1/2/3; basics 1/2; on the run...I have them all). This as mentioned in other reviews, well it is huge like the size of a laptop &amp; if you think about it, in a way it&#x27;s travel friendly coz of all those colors in 1 place but unfriendly to keep it in ur purse, like I wouldn&#x27;t trust it in my luggage on a plane coz of fear it would get banged up &amp; scatter the powder all over my clothes. i love the quality elf makes available for such afforable prices. I&#x27;m such a sucker for palettes &amp; they usually come w at least a few, or sometimes half the colors I can&#x27;t use like electric blue or fuschia or purple but I love neutrals &amp; there isn&#x27;t a single unusable shade/no shades I don&#x27;t care for/no duds. Wow for $20 (I got it for less than what it&#x27;s currently retailing &amp;#34;listed price,&amp;#34; there was only 1 in stock from the other e-tailer), u get a whole bunch of really good cruelty-free highly pigmented high quality eyeshadows! Elf was crazy to discontinue their neutral 144; I will never use this up entirely probably but the novelty is fun, &amp; if u like this but want something about half as big elf does have a smaller version (36? 40? pan). Elf makes many a fine product! Perfect gift! I gifted this to myself for my bday.</li>
    <li> O love this makeup. There are so many colors to choose from to max and blend. I wish there were less matte colors but overall I am so pleased.</li>
    <li> My mom and I love love love this eyes lips face palette!! The colors are just beautiful and it lasts all day long! By far my favorite!!</li>
    <li> Three times I bought this product but I received always damage . I like this item but enough I dont buying again</li>
    <li> i got the super rainbow one at first, and was so impressed i thought this neutral shade one would be super cool too. nope. it&#x27;s like a completely different formula, no color payoff whatsoever, super sandy, maybe 2 or 3 colors actually do their job. i&#x27;m only comparing it to the same brand&#x27;s other products, it&#x27;s pretty thrifty and not even worth the low price</li>
    <li> All the colors a girl will ever need ! Great price for someone like me who just wants to experiment with eye shadows.</li>
    <li> These colors are so beautiful and for the amount of money I got this for I should get ALL my colors. I don&#x27;t know if it was the seller or USPS but BEWARE because one of the colors in my set was shattered all over the set and missing. It&#x27;s upsetting because I wanted to try all my colors but I guess that won&#x27;t be happening. I don&#x27;t want to return it because there&#x27;s a possibility of someone saying, &amp;#34;oh, you did this yourself.&amp;#34; So forget that. I&#x27;m just very unhappy and wish that that color was still there.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! A couple of the shadows look a little smudged or touched, and one of the shadows broke. But overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful pallete.</li>
    <li> I lov all the colors in this pallet box, if you like natural colors this is the one! Also great for those smokey eyes!! ;) .. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it was broken from one corner and a color square was missing, it would explain all the powdered color inside.  Their not so great with their packaging if their going to be throwing it around but the colors are great.</li>
    <li> color is lovely and good test ! It&#x27;s awesome. I love  &#x27;eyes ilps face&#x27; .&lt;br /&gt;but, late packages arrive .</li>
    <li> This is a great Palette! I love all the colors In it! I would definitely buy another one of these palettes! I love E.l.f</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews, some hot some cold but I love it. For the price it is an excellent deal. Lots of very pigmented colours and the shimmer shades are the absolutely divine, very bright and show even without a base. I can only imagine how much they will pop when I do go all out! The matte colours are a bit underwhelming but I can easily over look a few duds and colour duplicates as the majority of the palette is amazing for $15. I love neutral colours, they&#x27;re much more sophisticated in my opinion, particularly for my profession and life style so I am going to have an amazing time and lots of fun with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The palette is rather large, it does hold 144 full sized shadows afterall. Be careful with the lid, because it will break off the hinges easily. It is very cheap feeling. Reminds you of dollar store quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my 14 year old daughter. She wanted a palette of similar colors and at fifteen bucks for 144 shadows, it is hard to pass up. It gives a lot of colors to play around with. The quality though of the shadows leaves a lot to be desired, but again, what do you expect for fifteen bucks? These definitely do not compare to Urban Decay, Too Faced, or any other decent brands. In fact, I have a few Maybelline and Cover Girl quads that are of MUCH better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely want to use a primer before you try to apply any of these eyeshadows. You can even use your regular foundation if you don&#x27;t have primer, of course. I did that for years &amp; years until they came out with primers. The matte shadows are really hard to actually get on your eyes. Not very pigmented at all. They do not show up well. They are very sheer/washed out and do not have much staying power. I found them to be rather chalky and they just have an overall \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; texture. The frosts/shimmers are a bit better, but again you will want to use a primer or base to get good coverage and extend the staying power. The primer or base will help you build the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I guess you really can&#x27;t complain, but if you are someone who is really into makeup/shadows, you might not be satisfied with the performance of these - especially if you use Urban Decay, or other better brands. As young as my daughter is, she definitely noticed that these weren&#x27;t very good quality, but she likes to play around with them and it saves her high end palettes from being used up so quickly.</li>
    <li> As like many others before I read the reviews of this product before I purchased. Many people were not very happy with the quality of the make up but said the price made it worth the while. Well the price is what did draw me to the product. I weighed the cost of current make-up from the &amp;#34;make-up giants&amp;#34; the monopolize the store aisles and found this to be a much better bargain. This palette I found to be better quality then what I would purchase from the store and the price was a much better bargain. The shipping of it can be tricky a few of the shadows did pop lose but nothing a little glue could not fix. I found application to be easy and I did not have to use a lot of the product to get the desired effect. I will be reordering this product when it runs out.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful. Some have glitter. A beautiful assortment of colors. Great variety. No damage. Excellent price. This is definitely a must buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time in buying such a huge collection of eyeshadows in one palette üòç I was so excited to use it and I&#x27;m super happy with it ... the only negative point is that I&#x27;ve received the palette with 4 damaged colors :( but overall I loved it so much , it deserves to earn 4 stars inspite of the inaccurate packaging!</li>
    <li> Love this palette. It has all the neutral colors you would ever need. Great color payoff and long lasting. I believe that I bought this product a couple of months ago and have not hit pan. I use the product nearly every d‚Äãay.</li>
    <li> Thrilled with this! Had it almost a year and still have tons of the shades left, I always have issues with eyeshadow breaking and crumbling not this one!</li>
    <li> I love neutral eye colors - I think they make all eye colors pop. I&#x27;ve purchased many over the years and even though I&#x27;ve liked them, it&#x27;s such a pain to have to dig through all the containers to find the one you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased many E.L.F. products and I like them, so when I saw this palette I was excited. ALL these colors in ONE palette? Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually confused when it arrived at my door...it was packaged differently then what I was expecting....I actually thought I got a book! Anyway, there wasn&#x27;t too much in the way of protection for this item...a bubble wrap bag surrounded it and then placed inside a cardboard book shipper. The plastic container the shadows are in has a small crack, but it&#x27;s not a game stopper. I didn&#x27;t purchase the container...I purchased the eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is HUGE. I have a Sony Vaio Laptop and it is literally an inch and a half smaller them my laptop! I saw some reviews that complain the eye shadows are very small...each shadow is approximately 1 inch. That&#x27;s not very small in my book...especially when you are getting ONE HUNDRED and FORTY FOUR of them! For the price you will pay for this - I feel it&#x27;s definitely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the colors go - They are all amazing. You get Light and Dark browns, tans, peaches, golds, coppers, greys, blacks and more - all in various shades. You get Mattes and Shimmers. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, and I&#x27;ve tried them alone and with Primer. Primer definitely makes them extremely prominent while using them alone makes them very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;They all feel like silk on my skin. I get no creasing or fading -looks just as good after wearing for 10 hours! I&#x27;ve had no irritation from any so far, and I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes &amp;#60;occasional contact wearer&amp;#62; and my eyes don&#x27;t tear up or feel irritated at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - GREAT Neutral Colors for a super price! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this Palette if you&#x27;re looking for Neutral colors!king for Neutral colors!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Eye Shadow Palette for the color&#x27;s in it because I have Auburn hair color and while I am not super fair complected I am not darker complected and need something in between.  For anyone who has Auburn hair ( Reddish-Brown) or Red Hair the color&#x27;s in this palette would be ideal for you.  Red heads wear earth tone color&#x27;s great and this palette is just that earth tone.  Shipping was fast and the palette was intact with no damage at all.  The color&#x27;s are beautiful and apply smoothly!!! Great price Great product!!!</li>
    <li> So I just got my eyeshadow palette today and I received it damaged with two eyeshadow colors that is almost gone. I was upset. Other than that the eye shadows work perfectly !</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, I received it on time, but I found the plastic cover smashed in pieces and three of the colors were displaced and one seemed as it is used. I wish I never ordered it.</li>
    <li> First off, I have just received this item and have only used it briefly. The shipping was incredibly fast and the shadows are great. Huge selection for the price. However, when I opened the package a dark purple shadow had broken into loose shadow and come completely unglued from the center of the palette. This caused dark purple eye shadow to cover several of the other colors, my jeans, and the couch. I just want to advise a caution in ordering this item because I read another review of this same problem. I do not think it is a practical item for shipping.</li>
    <li> This palette is AMAZING! When I was buying it, I read some reviews that said it came broken and they couldn&#x27;t use it but mine came in perfect condition. It lasts the entire day without smearing or anything. I think it&#x27;s perfect!! It&#x27;s my go-to eyeshadow because the colors are beautiful. It truly has something for everyone, whether they love shimmery (like me), matte, natural, darker shades, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone, whether they love makeup or are just beginning to wear it! I have lots and lots of makeup and I have to admit, I&#x27;m still extremely excited every time I use it! :) Definitely buy it! It&#x27;s SO worth the money! I think it actually has better (and a lot more) colors than any other palette like NAKED and it&#x27;s more than half the price! Count me in!!</li>
    <li> this palette is not even pigmented at all i hate it ! waste of money ! not the seller fault tho the product just isnt that great</li>
    <li> I loved this it went on so well on top of my primer  I can&#x27;t wait to use this again</li>
    <li> This palette looks great and the colors all show up very well. There are a large variety of both shimmers and mattes. There are colors for any skin tone or eye color. It has definitely become one of my favorite palettes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. I was a little afraid that some of the colors would be broken but it was in perfect condition when I opened it. The colors are very pigmented and just beautiful. If your thinking about ordering this do it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a budding young make-up artist.  Evidently e.l.f. is a great brand and also inexpensive.  Lots of beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> So many colors to choose from. And unlike some pallets, the eye shadows are not cheap and flaky. They all go on smooth and look great</li>
    <li> these eye shadows are by far the best love the colors and they feel smooth and really stay on.Thank you for the fast service and product arrived in a great condition. I definitely order these again!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been looking for neutral palettes everywhere, but refuse to spend 80+ on a huge MAC palette. I bought this along with Coastal Scents (for God sakes, don&#x27;t but the knockoffs on Amazon, they smell like acrylic pants), but I found that the ELF palette creases while the COASTAL SCENTS 28 EYESHADOW NEUTRAL PALETTE is MUCH BETTER. It doesn&#x27;t crease and doesn&#x27;t include LOADS of sparkly eyeshadows which I personally don&#x27;t use very often save for the holidays. If I would get it again, I would still get both because of the AMAZING variety, but I do enjoy the Coastal Palette more! Hope this helps makeup lovers!</li>
    <li> Although the quality is great i don&#x27;t know why this was received with two broken pieces just ruined the whole thing</li>
    <li> love love love the colors!</li>
    <li> excellent colors but they go on fairly sheer, apply thickly or deal with diluted colors.  All and all a decent palate for the price, excellent for beginners or if you want to practice with different colors/combinations without worrying about wasting money.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and very strong color pigments! You will love  ;-)&lt;br /&gt; Will show nice on eyelids. Lasting colors that are beautiful</li>
    <li> The plastic cover was cracked and broken. I glued it back together but it was really annoying. The eyeshadow is fine though.</li>
    <li> 2 shades come broken....only for this,,,because i like the product!! its only this....but i realy like a i don&#x27;t change because i return to Brasil</li>
    <li> LOVE it. Pretty colors (:</li>
    <li> All the neutral to choose from yes!!! And really fast shipping I will order this item in the future</li>
    <li> Awesome pigmentation and nice mix of matte and shimmer. You really need to wet the brush before application though to get their full effect.</li>
    <li> My child is happy now.</li>
    <li> Before, I had been using an eyeshadow of lesser quality. Throughout the day I felt like I had to constantly touch up my eyes, even when using a primer. It was just something I had learned to deal with. I was pleasantly surprised that there&#x27;s very little need for touch up with this brand so far. I use this eyeshadow with a primer from Walmart and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Really good, great pigments. Great colours to choose from. Works well. Great gor beginners! Anyone can use this set to make any look required.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colours but the product doesn&#x27;t have much pigmentation so I have to apply it with Mac&#x27;s Fix Plus in order to get the desired effect.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Just loved how fast it got hhere!</li>
    <li> So far I like it. Good array of colors, both matte and shimmer. Mine arrived in one piece and was also shipped face down like previous posters reviews started. So far so good! Happy Buyer!</li>
    <li> The colors are not pigmented at all. I had to put many layers on in order to achieve the same color shown in the palette even with primer on! Elf has man great products but this is not one of them! It is of terrible quality and probably terrible for the face as well! I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> Colors look good in package,  colors look different when apply and does not stay on well even with a primer.</li>
    <li> Great colors! Long lasting just wish I knew names or numbers so I could purchase more of the ones I love</li>
    <li> I need to return this item; it came with five of the colors damaged and spread all over the rest.</li>
    <li> Eh I got this palette as a gift... I use it sometimes but not that much.. It wears off too quickly throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Some of the eyeshadows were missing upon delivery</li>
    <li> This pallet is beautiful. I use it daily, I wish it was easier to travel with, but who cares. When it arrived it actually looked better than the picture. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> The colors are wonderful, they blend well. I loved the product but it made my eyes itch so after a week of using them I had to stop coz my eyes where just getting worse.</li>
    <li> I love this palette the colors are really nice and they show up well. And they stay on decently too. It came 3 days after I ordered it and there was no damages at all. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to use this palette but when I received it  there were five broken eyeshadows that were all over the place. In my opinion it was not shipped safely. It was just put in a box with other items and nothing that prevented it from moving around during shipping.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I sort of expected it to be really poor quality makeup because it&#x27;s such low price. However, I think the quality is pretty decent, and all the colors are really great for trying new things with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not amazing, but very decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the colors! They are even prettier in person. Some are shimmery (not overly so) and some are matte. They all are very well pigmented. Great texture as well, very silky. I have not yet worn it for more than 6-8 hours, so I can&#x27;t say if it lasts all day and night like some shadows, but I have not reason to think that it won&#x27;t last. It didn&#x27;t crease on me after 8 hours of wear. I do use a shadow base, but still..its really good eyeshadow. And for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, JUST BUY IT. Its worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it! A lot of colors to choose from. Ordered it and it came fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up that often.  I saw this and thought needed to up my game.&lt;br /&gt;Aslo, the product is not tested on ANIMALS.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently waiting for this product. I&#x27;m really excited and happy to know I&#x27;ll be receiving a Well designed product. my friend has This Eyeshadow palette and She loves it. I tried it out before coming on here and buying one for myself. Were both 14 and love to work with makeup. My friend is like a makeup artist, with the skills she has. So I can always retreat to her for advice on buying makeup. Right now it&#x27;s currently out of stock and hoping they will be in stock soon. I would like to receive this before my Birthday.</li>
    <li> completed my life! i love elf products and this palette couldn&#x27;t have made my day any better! any color i chose its fab!</li>
    <li> We had been looking for this particular set of eye shadows for some time! Found it and purchased a Christmas gift! Super fast shipping and the seller was Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of e.l.f. products in general, they almost always deliver and for incredibly inexpensive prices, and this is just another hit! I was a little concerned when I read some reviews about product damage from shipment, but mine arrived in mint condition. The packaging isn&#x27;t particularly fancy, but its sturdy and a surprisingly good weight. While it is huge - about the size of a laptop - the color selection is great, with a variety of shades and finishes. It&#x27;s easy to just use one palette for numerous looks, very quick and simple. The quality is decent; I&#x27;d recommend a good primer, as always, but for the money it can&#x27;t be beat! Awesome product for beginners or anyone on a budget. If you&#x27;re looking for a versatile and inexpensive eyeshadow palette, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;-Grace Ditthardt</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this palette. I got mine from Target for $15. But it&#x27;s not even worth it. The colors are not pigmented at all. Even if you apply the primer before applying them.</li>
    <li> When I received the palette it was broken. They shipped it with the palette facing the bottom of the box and not facing in other way where the protective packs where.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors and last long time</li>
    <li> I completely love this palette. love the neutral eye shadows. despite the price , they are good quality and pigmented. I highly recommend .</li>
    <li> this is the best makeup i have ever gotten! they are so beautiful and i love them. i will buy this again when i run out, if i run out!</li>
    <li> Wow! You&#x27;ll never be short of inspiration with this mega-set from e.l.f.! With a fabulous range of neutrals from lightest to darkest you can mix and match and blend to your heart&#x27;s desire. If you are in the mood to play around and experiment with new looks, or if you are just in a hurry to get ready for work, this set is economical perfection. Go for the natural look, or shoot for ultra-dramatic, this set has it all. Imagine not having to open all those little snap-cases! A primer will insure all day staying power, and the glamour of in-depth color saturation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the e.l.f website and you&#x27;ll find that quite a little will buy a lot!</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Shipped fasted just like they said it would. Hoping to get more things like this. I got it as a gift for my friends an she uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I was worried that when my palette arrived some of the eye shadow would be broken.. Nope! Everything is perfect. There is only a scratch on the cover but not broken. And a huge plus, it arrived 2 days early!</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful so pigmented. Looks amazing last long just great it&#x27;s amazing hands down the best eyeshadow around for it&#x27;s price ordering another one soon</li>
    <li> I really like all the colors in this, and the price is right for such a huge selection. The quality isn&#x27;t the greatest, the shadow itself is kinda chalky and hard to blend. But the colors look good together and if you&#x27;re just going for a natural daytime look, this will give you a lot of options.</li>
    <li> So I bought this out of glowing reviews. ANyways the mattes, they just plain dont work so take 50% of the palette that totally useless, the colors, just make me look sick... IDK what to say, Ive used all the colors and absolutely hate every last one which surprises me, except for this very dark purple color... the colors I think are meant for olive skin tone, I work in the pink, and oranges, and none of these colors make me look radiant, they again just make me look worn out. Again I dont see this working for any skintone other then ones with a yellow, olive color.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I only use half of it, because it wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, but apparently the shippers weren&#x27;t too nice to it, because I had two broken colors that dirtied up some of the other colors and the casing. Speaking of which, be extremely careful when transporting, because the compartment it comes in is not exactly protective. If you can leave it in one stable place, then I would suggest doing so. Other than that, I absolutely love this palette. The colors are perfect, and you get so many of them! I am able to create hundreds of unique looks using this palette, and for a reasonable price from a notable brand.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet came faster than I thought</li>
    <li> These are not the highest quality shadows but for the color choice it&#x27;s worth it to me. I love this neutral palette especially, I have another one, that I don&#x27;t use probably 3/4 of because the colors are just way crazy.</li>
    <li> This is a palette that will give you a professional look very quickly in the morning. I love that all the colors are put together in one palette so I don&#x27;t have to go through 10 different individual jars when I&#x27;m in a hurry. The pigmentation, even on the mattes, is very decent (it can easily be built up, I always wear primer with it). The metallics are fantastically pigmented. I even wore eyeshadows fom this palette through a 75-minute extremely intense (and sweaty) workout and they still looked great afterwards (minimal creasing even if droplets of sweat were literally dripping from my face). It&#x27;s a wonderful collection of neutral shades that I reach for very often and that still give me great variety in terms of looks. I love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken and completely ruined. Complete garbage. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from E.l.f I was so excited when it arrived! soooo many colors. Well I promptly cleaned my face added E.L.F eyelid primer (I love this primer most of all the primers I&#x27;ve tried even, high end primers) and my excitement fizzled drastically. The pigments are awful, even using a wet eyeshadow brush I had to use a lot to get relatively close to what I wanted for color on my lids. If you want decently pigmented large eyeshadow pallets go with NYX or sephora brand pallets. Even for the mere 15$ I paid I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this item, but I will however regift this to my mother in law hahahaha</li>
    <li> With 144 colors at this fantastic price this is a steal you really should not miss. I got this instead of the $50 for 10 colors Naked Sephora pallet. This was definitely so much better. This thing is huge and there are so many beautiful choices!</li>
    <li> Love this pallet! Beautiful colors and better quility then I was expecting.</li>
    <li> It!s exactly what I wanted. The colors are neutral but still shiny and pretty at the same time, enjoying it!</li>
    <li> It has a lot of nice colors. I like the natural look and this works perfectly . I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Ehhh, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Cheap quality and only a tiny amount of each color. You get what you pay for so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
    <li> Love the neutral colors in this palette and it was at a great price when I bought it. I was like wow 144 colors of neutral I can dig that and plus it will definitely last me a very long time using this palette. E.L.F always have had good products in my eyes (just my opinion) so I can&#x27;t complain about it, it was worth the money and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon where it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> i opened the box to find that some of the colors had broken free and had messed up other colors. totally disappointed</li>
    <li> I had an older addition of this pallete in colors and nudes and so when I saw this plain nude one I was super stoked ! When u got it though two of the pots were completely out and broken all over everything ): product is great , just got messy in mailing . I&#x27;m still using it and not complaining but amazon shipping may not be the best . I also found it on the eyeslipsface website for $15 (: I&#x27;d look into that to ensure the safety of your product before it gets to you (:</li>
    <li> This was broken when i received it and the colors are NOT pigmented AT ALL.  I just hated this palette... DONT waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MAC makeup wearer, but I had bought some ELF products at Target and liked them so I figured I would give it a shot. Can&#x27;t express how much I love this palette! Colors are beautiful and long wearing.. Blend with my crazy expensive MAC products wonderfully, and get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I have the bright colors palette. There are so many colors, honestly I won&#x27;t use this whole thing in my life. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, after a long day of wear the colors fade, and you can&#x27;t re-apply if your out because this palette is like a laptop. lol</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughters for Christmas, they all love love love it.  The colors are good and they last all day. They go on easy and blend well.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product i ever bought, some of the pieces were missing and most of them are worn out, i wish i could get back my money.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter was in heaven when she opened this 144 piece eye shadow!  She loves it! The colors are true to what was advertised and we couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t packaged very well.  One of the eyeshadows was broken and had spilled all over the palette.  The top of the box was ripped like someone had tried to open it before.  However, after reading other reviews about how other people had 4 or 5 eyeshadows broken every time they sent the package back for a replacement, I decided to cut my losses and keep the palette with only 1 broken eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The packaging ruined this product for me. Upon it&#x27;s arrival, the plastic cover was busted up in the corners and a glimmery eyeshadow was busted up inside, leaving almost every color colored in it&#x27;s golden iridescence. How do you break plastic up THAT bad? It almost seemed like it was broken prior to it&#x27;s packaging, because it was in a fairly large box with bubble wrap, and I saw that there was gold eyeshadow on even the OUTSIDE of the E.L.F. packaging. I don&#x27;t think that this seller is an honest one.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow palette was just what I was looking for.  Loved it so much bought one for my daughter who loves it.</li>
    <li> You do get what you pay for. A lot of the colors are pigmented but have some troubles with the lighter ones (light skinned african american). Overall i love the colors. You do primer for them to show truer and last long. The colors tend to fade after a while but primer should do the trick. Very beautiful palette though. I recommend to beginners.</li>
    <li> my daughter an I share the kit and love it . the colors are so easy to mix and match.</li>
    <li> Pro: The pigment payoff is decent for such an econo-priced palette.  Con: Can be a bit large for storage depending on space and some of the color variations are very similar.</li>
    <li> When I got the package it was broken into a bunch of pieces and the eyeshadow spilled out everywhere. I love the colors that survived but I lost a lot of colors as well.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this pallette since I love neutrals and e.l.f. brand is one of my favorites. I have no problems with the item its self and the delivery was very fast. My problem is that my package was half open, the box containing the pallete was coming off the back and once I opened the package, the plastic was cracked and some of the eye shadows are broken, leaving the inside of the glass covered in eyeshadow powder. This is frustrating because I&#x27;ve never had any kind of issue with anything I&#x27;ve bought off amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and I never even used it. It was with a horrible smell and not worth the money. For the quality it should have been $3.00. I would never buy cheap make up again. I would love a refund because this is just awful.</li>
    <li> The product is really good. It is very soft and looks natural. It met my expectations. Thank you for the product and your services!</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeeee this eyeshadow palette.It was bigger than I thought and that made it even better.It has a lot of beautiful neutral colors.and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I bought this on clearance at Target. I think it was $10. I am African American, and this set works perfect for me. The colors I used were great. I used a primer and my eyes came out really nice. I love the colors.</li>
    <li> Tried almost every color in this palette. Love the colors. They stay on (do not fade). Definitely a Must have;)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Love the product .</li>
    <li> i received  my purchases, but  i was very shocked I&#x27;ve had the e.l.f Eye Shadows palette damaged and dirty with the black shadow color and it affected all other  palette lights colors. i sent a feed back to the seller with pictuers But no one pay me any attention or care.&lt;br /&gt;This is unacceptable&lt;br /&gt; For the first time i  receiced my ordered like this , and I expect something good. but i think it will be the last time .&lt;br /&gt; really i am Shocked and very sad. it was a gift  for my sister .&lt;br /&gt;i took pictures please see it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the case of&lt;br /&gt;I hope your cooperate and fix this problem.&lt;br /&gt;waiting for your response .</li>
    <li> This palette is huge and the colors are beeeeeaaaautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this because I couldnt find this particular palette on the elf website</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she has had for 3 months now and it still looks good and so does she lol. shes a make up fanatic and she compares this to other $$$$ brands and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I opened a perfect box, no dents, no ripped tape nothing. How ever as soon as I pull the palette out, I can see eye shadow all over the case. I open it up and three of the colors are empty or close to in random places! Package came fast and like I said, nothing wrong with that. Just the eye shadow itself...</li>
    <li> Though it is reasonably priced and the collection is vast, the pigmentation on these shades is not very high.  I am enjoying playing with all different neutrals and feel for $10 to $15 it is worth it.  Just don&#x27;t throw out your old stand-bys.</li>
    <li> yI ordered this palette from the elf website. The shipping said 3 to 5 days but it did not get to my home till 8 days later BUT it was worth the wait. The palette is so gorgeous . I watched many review videos on YouTube and read many reviews on amazon  about This palette FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s very pigmented and the colors are BEAUTIFUL. I&#x27;m VERY pleased.</li>
    <li> The best large collection of shades I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Came in great condition in less than a week! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite makeup items in my makeup drawer. The pigmentation for most of the colors is great. As we know with elf, their matte shades are a bit chalky and less pigmented. But, you can&#x27;t beat the price for all of the colors you get. If you love neutral colors then you will love this palette! It&#x27;s great for work, school, or even a soft Smokey eye.</li>
    <li> Love the colors!&lt;br /&gt;I paid for 144 colors i only got 140 because if the AWFUL shipment. The Palette was face down and some of the colors were broken.</li>
    <li> I love this neutral pallette. I wanted to start doing my own makeup so I started with the neutral pallette since it would be safest. I was so excited when it arrived! The colors blend well. I thought e.l.f was going to skimp on the colors, but it&#x27;s just the right amount for me. Definitely will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of the reviewers comments on this product. It was package very well I received my order quickly and in perfect condition. The colors are amazing and stays on all day. Great product and great price. Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I received the product in s very very poor package my product is broken but I am get sivk of send it back farward as I order e.l.f.twice happened the same still broken:( I am not sure of I want to order gjis brand again as I am not sure with quality when I received it</li>
    <li> I got it the next day and in perfect conditions.. The color are even more beautiful then what i saw in the picture.. I love itttt!!</li>
    <li> well the product is very well the colors are real and excellent in quality value are price I  like this</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount of eyeshadow in one convenient palette.  I&#x27;ve seen this item mentioned by customers who have used it and love them.  I&#x27;m sure I will to!  Can&#x27;t wait to try them.  Package arrived on time and packaged very good with bubble wrap etc.  the only thing negative (no big deal for the price) but one eyeshadow was missing and they don&#x27;t stay in the palette.  Nothing a drop of glue can&#x27;t fix.  Otherwise I think I&#x27;ll enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> THIS PALETTE IS GREAT FOR GOING OUT OR A WORK DAY. VERY BLENDABLE AND SOFT WITHOUT CREASING. THE COLORS ARE WEARABLE FOR ANY OCCAISION!</li>
    <li> That Palette is awesome! The colors are high pigment...Ich habe gesehen das es sie auch in Deutschland gibt, und bin sehr begeistert :)</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. However, when it was delivered one of the eye shadows had popped out of place and exploded over all of the other shadows. Luckily I could clean it up but it made a mess.</li>
    <li> The color does not stay on.  Purchased for my daughter and she will not use it because the quality just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> I loved the colors and my daughter thought it would be great. It was not packaged well enough and arrived with several of the colors completely broken and scattered over the unbroken colors. Would like to order again, but wish that Amazon would pagage it better.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette as a gift set for friend just starting to use make-up and she absolutely loves it.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I really like this palette because it has a lot of my favorite shades: grey and black, maroons and reds, browns and bronzes, some oranges and yellows. Gives you lots of options. Not for you if you like blues or greens though.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this palette! The colors are beautiful and very pigmented, I am very impressed with this product. Shipping was great, it came on the estimated delivery date and it was very safe in the box. No harm done to the shadows, everything was perfect and looks just like the picture! I will be coming back to this palette when it runs out, but 144 colors will last me a very long time :)</li>
