<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these lip liner pencils. The colors are great and I use all of them. This was so much cheaper than buying them all individually at the drugstore. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, slide on quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the feel of the pencils on my lips.</li>
    <li> These pencils are the bomb</li>
    <li> Kinda hard texture, and these colors are very close to each other. They&#x27;re all very light and bright, I was hoping for a better range.</li>
    <li> Nice colors, good product</li>
    <li> I really like this product but not the seller I bought it from.</li>
    <li> These liners are very pigmented and long lasting, the colors are beautiful! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, the delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> Soft and glides on pretty well. I was expecting a little more pigment. Nice pencils for the price. Do a All Red set, Please!</li>
    <li> Super cheap and great pigmentation! Must buy, skip the name brand expensive 15-20$ a lip pencil. This is what you need.</li>
    <li> I kept on seeing MUA&#x27;s using NYX mixed with other lipsticks, mixing different pencils with lip gloss to top it off unless looking for a matte look or ombre style and wanted to try it for myself.  Buying in sets of six was a great savings and start for me.</li>
    <li> Great variety of lip liners, especially if you love to wear red and pink lippies</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used this product enough to give it a higher rating. Used one and it was Ok. Satisfied customer and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> The products seem good and shipped really fast. My concern is that none of the pencils were sealed. The products didn&#x27;t look used, but why were the seals removed? I hope I don&#x27;t get an infection!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really match up with the lipstick that I ordered. All in all still a decent product. I prefer my liner to match my stick.</li>
    <li> I love them. They are perfect &amp; the colors are so fashionable on what&#x27;s being used right now. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Got different colors than what I saw on the picture!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They did not even come in a box</li>
    <li> Great value! I already bought the neutral set and was very satifsfied, so I go tthis set so to go with some red lipsticks Colors are long lasting and bright.</li>
    <li> I love nyx lippies so much! These lip liners are great and this set saves you money so why not just buy a set than buying one at a time? They go on easily and are nice and creamy and have a long lasting time!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, excelent texture. The color you see in the picture is pretty much the same when you receive the pencils. Loved it!</li>
    <li> The colors are ok, but some of them don&#x27;t come out as bold as the other ones. I have darker skin so some of the lighter colors are a bit difficult to see, kinda defeating the purpose of putting the lip liner in the first place.</li>
    <li> I like to outline my lipstick and the colors that I wanted I would have paid more for them so when I seen these together I said I have NYX lipstick to match each color.  Nice pencils for the price.</li>
    <li> I have wanted some Nyx cosmetics ever since they gave a lifetime supply to the winner of RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race!!  I love the stuff!!!  Goes on smooth, has lasting power, and the colors are amazing!  Well worth the money...  I have bought 3 sets of this stuff off of Amazon, soooo many colors to choose from!  Highly recommend these products!!</li>
    <li> These liners are a must have for any ladies collection. The colors are true and are a beautiful compliment on my chocolate skin. They glide on smooth and are a matte finish. I use them as a liner and for full lip coverage. Did I mention paying nine dollars was a steal?! Grab them while you can!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed these colors. They were a cheap alternative to purchasing actual lipsticks from other brands. I can also use them with the other lipsticks and glosses that I already own so thats a plus</li>
    <li> I love Nyx lip liners, they can be used alone with gloss. Shipping was fast but the lip liners have little color variation.</li>
    <li> Lip liners came before I expected. Love colors. They show up great. Deep red and cabaret look similar but they aren&#x27;t the same. Plush red is pinker than hour red plum is plum lol nude pink is actually nude not too pink. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Very good quality Lip liner, The color is exactly as the picture, I really recomended.</li>
    <li> Like all the colors I got... But they are not the same color in the picture... Still like them</li>
    <li> I have many shades of red and pink lipstick and now I have the lip liners to match. One of these colors is bound to match my mood that day. I just got them last week, so I haven&#x27;t needed to sharpen any yet, but they go on very smoothly and could even be used as a matte lipstick.</li>
    <li> love these liners, affordable quality, very smooth application, works as good as my MAC liners with half the price. Will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> The color was good, and it seems to work. But it smells and tastes awful! It looks good, but don&#x27;t wear it if you&#x27;re going out on a dinner date.</li>
    <li> Though you can&#x27;t tell by the pic, the colors are quite different from each other. Goes on easily and lasts. Like the variety of colors and thought it was a pretty good deal. Delivered quickly and packaged securely.</li>
    <li> This is a great color collection of reds and burgundy lip liners.  I have never been disappointed by NYX lip liners.  Go on smooth and a great variety of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily over dry lips or chapsticked lips.  Some of the shades are stronger than others, but they color in well, last long (even after drinking and eating), and will shade the inner part of very full lips (try managing THAT with lipstick!).</li>
    <li> excelent in everything. fast</li>
    <li> I really like these. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Colors are great. NYX pencils are always great: not too hard and not too soft. Buy the NYX pencil sharpener though because the wood is fairly hard and did a number on my generic sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only really writing a review because the pink pencil included is NUDE PINK not EDGE PINK. The description says nude and so did most of the reviews but the product name says edge. I wanted the nude pink more than the edge pink but be aware of which color you are getting.</li>
    <li> A great deal on NXY pencils if you love them as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Great variety in this pack. I wear them as general lipstick - they stay on all night and the matte look is more natural.</li>
    <li> They were just as describes and works great</li>
    <li> These are affordable and great quality to boot. Can&#x27;t go wrong. The red colors are all different and bold, and the colors last.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these lip liners. The colors are amazing and go well with all my lipsticks. They glide on perfectly and do not leave my lips dry. Sometimes I just line my lips and fill it in and I&#x27;m good to go! Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I love ALL the colors in this collection and the liners stay on a long time and they all matted colors! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a lip stain but everything I have tried has left my so dried out. I also like lip glosses but they never seem to last long enough. I bought these liners and use them to line and fill in my entire lip and them add a bit of NYX mega shine lipgloss in Perfect red or natural and it it perfect for me!  Lasts a long time but doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m trying to hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale skin and these looks great on me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid red lipstick wearer and jump at that occasion to wear a nice red lipstick. The lip liners add that extra pop! I love applying the liner and color lipstick everytime. And plus you can&#x27;t beat the price for so many colors! compared to what they sell each of them for on their site and in stores.</li>
    <li> Like but the colors i got were not as the one&#x27;s in the picture. I didn&#x27;t really like the one&#x27;s I got maybe it you had the option of choosing your colors it would be better.</li>
    <li> Great to use for an ombre lip. They go on easily and smoothly and the color lasts and there are a nice selection of colors here in this set. Perfect with my skin tone and the lipsticks I have. Gives a number of options which I love. Nice to use with just a gloss too. Great set.</li>
    <li> I love the way these go on and wear but the set I got has more red shades. There are great shades but they do not match the colors shown in the  picture. But  the product is really good and for that price I will find another set that meets the pinks like the picture.</li>
    <li> Really love these pencils</li>
    <li> Wow, this is great lip liner that stays on and has many great colors! Go get some! You will love it!</li>
    <li> Colors are good, nice shades of reds, pinks and plums. They sharpen well and go on easily. However, they have no staying power so not good for long wear. Also after a couple weeks of daily use, my lips are quite dry and a bit cracked so have had to stop using them. I would recommend that you use a lip balm on top of these to avoid the same problem.</li>
    <li> I have used these liners before, and I love them! They glide on, the pencils lase, no breaking of color as with the roll up kind, no need to refill, vivid colors.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of Nyx lip pencils was the 6-pencil set in pinks and purples. I fell in love with Nyx lip pencils so decided to buy this red set to give me more color options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are some of the best lip pencils I have owned--they are NOT dry and crumbly like some of the ones I have had in the past. Given how much ONE lip pencil can cost in the store, I felt that the cost was reasonable for this collection of 6 pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been much of a lipstick person, but what I&#x27;ve started doing this year is wearing lip gloss (usually a neutral color) over lip pencil, which gives the appearance of lipstick. With these great Nyx lip pencil sets, I can have a good range of colors for a fraction of the cost of the same number of lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first set I purchased was all pinks and purples; therefore, when I saw so many red colors listed in this set, I expected it to be all reds. Not so. The plum, edge pink and even, to some extent, the caberet colors in this set belong much more in the pink/purples set than a set of reds. That said, they are all beautiful shades. For the most part, they are all darker shades than the pink set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are so many shades of pink, you would think they would have been able to find more than three shades of red (or even corals) to include in this set. That said, I really do enjoy using these pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included a picture and description (in my opinion) of each color in this set. You can find it at the top left side of the product page under customer images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> i love this product and its cheaper to buy it on here than to pay $3.50 for each pencil on the nyx website</li>
    <li> Very pretty sexy colors however it is not really long lasting</li>
    <li> great deal for the price- this set has an awesome  color combo, works well as a lipstick base, or even on its own!</li>
    <li> Love it great colors very affordable</li>
    <li> Really love the pigment and variety of colors that NYX makes. Great bang for your buck. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re easy to use, nice colors, stick fairly well.</li>
    <li> I have now ordered every color...that should tell you I like the product. I use them as lipsticks, I like the matte look in lipstick and these are my lipsticks</li>
    <li> This was my first time using any sort of lip liner (I didn&#x27;t really have the need for it prior to this). I purchased it to go along with NYX&#x27;s &amp;#34;Snow White&amp;#34; lipstick, because I had heard that it bleeds quite a lot (it does, FYI). Seeing as how I had never used it, I was afraid that I was going to botch it up and end up looking stupid... but the application was really great! Very smooth, very sleek, and &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34; goes perfectly with the lipstick I bought. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love these. The colors are awesome and I put them on prior to applying lipstick, and it really helps it last!</li>
    <li> Great price, some of the colors are a little too similar to be of much use but I split them with my sister so it worked out perfectly! I would totally buy this pack again in another color set. Well worth the buy, I use them everyday!</li>
    <li> For this price you really can&#x27;t beat it. the colors are a little bit similar but if you are like me that you don&#x27;t wear red or wine colored lipsticks or glosses often I didn&#x27;t mind. You get five colors for the price of like 2 or 3 liners when bought at the store.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife . She loves it and said it has rich color and right on trend! Great price too! She loves NYX</li>
    <li> The lip liner shows very vivid color on lips and the price is amazing low. However, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for the whole day. Also I need to buy a sharpener for these pencils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m LOVING the nude color even though I bought this pack to try Caberet. I&#x27;m still haven&#x27;t been brave enough to wear the other colors out of the house. MUA on reddit always says wonderful things about NYX lip liners though!</li>
    <li> These colors are just what I was looking for. They go on creamy and very easily and are very bright.</li>
    <li> the package of these six colours together is fantastic...the only colour missing is deep purple...the line stays true...would be even better as a continuous liner</li>
    <li> Pigmented and very good products.  NYX is my favorite! I am a Makeup Artist so these are always in my makeup kit</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 5 stars - could be 4 actually, but considering the cost and how many I use daily, I&#x27;ll go with 5 - it is NOT my favorite lip liner, but sometimes pencils are horrendous and they don&#x27;t work; these do apply quite easily, I really like all the colors which is a big bonus and the price cannot be beat - just know they may not be your favorite go to lip pencil, but I do really think you&#x27;ll be pleased but you need to use some other lip product with them - not fine on their own but a great base.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and smooth lip liners  I will be buying more.  Great color payoff and easy to apply . Very smooth and creamy</li>
    <li> Love these lipliners. Wish I&#x27;d gotten the lighter shades also. They are not as dry as some liners but stay on a long time.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase! My go-to colors in one set!</li>
