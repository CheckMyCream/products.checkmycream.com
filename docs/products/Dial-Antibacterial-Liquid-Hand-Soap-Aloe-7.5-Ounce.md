    <li> goes well in pink bathroom</li>
    <li> This soap smells really good. Dial is my favorite brand so that plus a great scent is a winning combination in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT-- when I ordered this 2 weeks ago, it was $1.49. When I came back to order more, the price was $7! For one small bottle of soap? Surely this is a mistake.</li>
    <li> At the end of the day it is just hand soap, but it does smell good. Great price on Subscribe and Save!</li>
    <li> First, let me start off by saying how I have REALLY sensitive skin. AND THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT. I was worried it would make my hands dry from frequent washing, but it did not. I was worried my hands would break out (like they have in the past wit other soaps, but it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this smells. I keep a bottle in the kitchen and the bathroom now. It leaves your hands smelling fresh and clean, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also cleans my piercings well! I have several piercings that I frequently clean and this is great for that too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 will continue to buy this product, especially in this scent!</li>

    <li> I love this soap because 1) it&#x27;s antibacterial and 2) it smells exactly like the pink Herbal Essences shampoo that all girls used in the 90s. Bonus: it&#x27;s also cheap!</li>
    <li> I use this lightly scented antibacterial soap in my guest bathroom.  It is pretty, matches my decor and works great.</li>

    <li> Love the smell and feel of this soap</li>
    <li> smells so good! I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands</li>
    <li> I love this everything Dial makes but this is one of my favorite products from Dial. As the color is so pretty and calming. It looks so pretty sitting on the counter. Plus it smells good. I love the way it lathers up. As well as the way it cleans. It last a long time. Plus it is more than a fair price. Even though you would think it is for girls both Charlie and David do not mind using it.</li>
    <li> Love the product. 3 stars cause I saw it at the grocery store for like $1.75</li>
    <li> It was ok. I didn&#x27;t care for it too much. And while I was using it I got an infection in my fingernail so it couldn&#x27;t have been cleaning too well. This is a no for me</li>
    <li> Great soap smell great</li>
    <li> The hand soap has a nice and refreshing smell to it. The texture is not too intense and easy to wash off. By no means did this blow my mind but I love the smell and feel and so do the kids.</li>
    <li> This soap smells really great. It&#x27;s a good fresh scent - not too heavy on the perfume, but not something that smells like a house cleaning product either. The light pink looks really pretty on the bathroom counter. Like all of the dial liquid antibacterial soaps, this foams and cleans well. The price through subscribe and save is comparable to what I pay in the store, but this way it comes directly to my door.</li>
    <li> excellent hand soap. after using this my hands feel like flowers (I am a man) and the scent makes me feel like I went to himalayas just to wash my hands.</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and guests always comment on how lovely the fragrance is. I would recommend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but the small bottle was to expensive !</li>
    <li> Smells great! Washes off clean. Trusty Dial Liquid Hand Soap each washroom in the house!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely. Can&#x27;t beat dial antibacterial in a great, subtle scent!</li>
    <li> I love this scent hand soap!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!!!!  I tried it once and continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. Recommend.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I love the way it smell...we will continue to buy it when it about run out....</li>
