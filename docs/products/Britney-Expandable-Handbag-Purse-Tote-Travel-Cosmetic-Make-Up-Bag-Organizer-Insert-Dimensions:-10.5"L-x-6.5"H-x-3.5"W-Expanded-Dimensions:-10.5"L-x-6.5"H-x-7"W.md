      <li>Idk why people say its cheaply made because its not !  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I am so satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Wish it was more sturdy</li>
      <li>but I realize it works better in bags that don&#x27;t collapse on itself.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a hobo style purse but works well for purses with a more square/rectangular shape.</li>
      <li>I particularly love this one for my tote bags and vacationing.  </li>

      <li>Love the weight and sturdiness for bag-to-bag exchange.  </li>
      <li>&#x27; I placed a piece of non-slip rug pad on top of the box and placed the tote on top of that.</li>
      <li>It serves its purpose, would have been better if it was made out of a canvas material and just keep its shape when it&#x27;s not loaded up with a bunch of stuff.</li>
      <li>and I was really pleased with the quality, looks and function.  </li>
      <li>You will absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was very happy with this organizer.</li>
      <li>so thought this would be perfect BUT for the type of big, leather, hobo bags I tend to gravitate towards, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and I was really pleased with the quality, looks and function.  The black with the leopard inside made it look classy!</li>
    <li> I have a huge purse, so it moved around a lot. Also the zippers broke a few weeks after I purchased it. Other than that I did enjoy this product. Loved all the pockets!</li>
    <li> I think the pockets sag alot, so items tend to drop out or fall into the space of another item.  It&#x27;s alright, but I am not thrilled like I would prefer to  be.</li>
    <li> Love it! Keeps me organized</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay item. It definitely keeps my purse organized but the inside pockets aren&#x27;t very deep and with minimal use the lining near the zipper has started to tear.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy enough to hold items securely.  A folded paper bag would be more study than this thing.  The pockets inside are way to floppy and soft - things get buried in the bag and it&#x27;s a huge effort to find anything as everything swims around in the bag making it impossible to maneuver and find items easily.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I have a rather large pocketbook/carry all.  This fits perfect and the expansion zippers are great.  Way better than I had expected and it&#x27;s also cute!!!!</li>
    <li> This organizer fit perfectly into my handbag. The width Is adjustable. Good quality. The only thing I don&#x27;t consider ideal is that all pockets are the same size - large. It would be nice if they varied in size. Overall very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice...Makes switching handbags very easy. Keeps everything organized!</li>
    <li> fits purse well but started to rip</li>
    <li> This is so much nicer than the one I had before. Definitely worth the money! Makes changing purses a breeze! Gotta love the leopard interior! Helps to see stuff you&#x27;ve put in there. Fast delivery. Good seller.</li>
    <li> I have numerous purses, and it is always a time consuming task to change the contents from one to another. I like to change purses frequently, so have been looking for an insert that would keep my purse contents organized and I could simply move when needed. This is exactly what I was looking for. Materials seem high-quality, and I love the many pockets inside for organizing items. It appears to be a perfect fit for most average sized purses. I am going to purchase several more as Christmas gifts this year.</li>
    <li> It works well in my diffrent handbags. I like the construction on the outside; the inside fabric however is a little too loose.</li>
    <li> Great organizer until inside pockets ripped after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> great gift for friends</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this tote! Sturdy, adorable and its worth your money. You will absolutely love this product. My order came in the mail just as they said. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice quality bag insert for the price. I am going to buy another one. What a great idea! Now I can quickly move things in my purse from one to another. I highly recommend this \\&quot;MyEasyBag.\\&quot; I purchased the black one with the leopard insert and it is very cute!</li>
    <li> I have liked having the tote for my purse. It keeps me organized and is easy to move to the next purse I am using. I am thinking of getting a couple as gifts as well.</li>
    <li> This tote organizer seems to be made very well and is pretty too even though they sent me the wrong one. I ordered the black with leopard inside &amp; received the zebra with black inside. It&#x27;s very nice &amp; will keep. fits great in my tote.</li>
    <li> Great concept and this purse tote would be PERFECT were it not for the fact that due to its satin outer lining it slides onto its side constantly causing items to spill out. At first I thought it was because my purse is so deep so I placed a small box in the bottom of my purse and placed the tote on top of it to give it some height. While I can definitely reach items easier due to the increased height, I still found the tote turning, which is frustrating. To combat the slippin&#x27; and slidin&#x27; I placed a piece of non-slip rug pad on top of the box and placed the tote on top of that. Took a little improvising, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I received the package and I was really happy.It exceeds my expectations.I was able to put all my important stuff in my bag without digging and looking hard inside. I will tell my friends to get this!</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review because someone else said that this organizer doesn&#x27;t last. Well... they were right! It ripped within 3 months time. It was a good price but I guess I should have spent a little more money for better quality. As far as organization.. it did the trick. I love the size and it fits well in my purses. I had to sew the lining back on to the side of the organizer. :(</li>
    <li> I personally love this bag organizer, everything fits and its morr easier to find everything. Idk why people say its cheaply made because its not !  I love it, strongly recommend it (:</li>
    <li> Wish it was more sturdy but I realize it works better in bags that don&#x27;t collapse on itself. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a hobo style purse but works well for purses with a more square/rectangular shape.</li>
    <li> The fabric of the interior pockets is flimsy which does not allow your items to slip into them as easily as i would prefer.</li>
    <li> I have the Longchamp Pliage Large Tote, and knew I had to get an organizer for it, b/c there is only one little side pocket in the bag that doesn&#x27;t hold much. I looked online at several organizers, and found a couple that had really good reviews but were at least $10 more expensive than the Britney.  I bought it in black with the leopard interior - and its great, b/c my Pliage is black with tan leather handles. If you look inside my bag, you&#x27;d never know there was a separate organizer inside, it just looks like its part of the bag. So it matches well if you have a black bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price point of less than $20, this is a sufficient organizer. When I received it a few days ago, I immediately arranged it with all my stuff.  To give you an idea of its capacity, it currently holds the following items with room to spare:&lt;br /&gt;- iPhone&lt;br /&gt;- Wallet&lt;br /&gt;- Keys&lt;br /&gt;- Mints&lt;br /&gt;- Sunglass case (a rather thick case)&lt;br /&gt;- A small makeup bag - holds makeup, hand lotion, face blot, fem hygiene products, frizz hair serum etc..&lt;br /&gt;- A small pill case for various meds, painkillers, tummy ache relief, etc...&lt;br /&gt;- A pen&lt;br /&gt;- A small notebook&lt;br /&gt;- A small LED flashlight&lt;br /&gt;- Tissues (travel size)&lt;br /&gt;- A little emergency tin containing safety pins, double sided fabric tape, hair ties, wet wipes, bandaids.&lt;br /&gt;- Tide To Go pen&lt;br /&gt;- Travel folding wide toothed comb&lt;br /&gt;- Granola bar that I leave in their for emergencies (if i&#x27;m stuck in traffic for hours..who knows?!) LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some space left in the organizer for some other small items if I needed them, but these are the things I keep in there every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 6 months later I&#x27;m updating this review to let you know that the organizer is falling apart on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - that is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Love the concept and shopped around before deciding on this. Love the weight and sturdiness for bag-to-bag exchange.  The inside pockets are material with out structure and I would have liked &#x27;stiffer&#x27; pockets.</li>
    <li> I am organized, and that is saying ALOT. This organizer offers several pockets in a structured out side case. Well made and great quality.</li>
    <li> This fits into most of my bags perfectly thanks to the expandable zippers.  It is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
    <li> This one really keeps your things near and organized because its a good size. Great product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> works well for why I bought it.  The pockets are a bit loose but I just sewed them up a little.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start switching out bags to match my outfits so thought this would be perfect BUT for the type of big, leather, hobo bags I tend to gravitate towards, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The purse tote ends up flipped on its side or upside down inside the bag dumping out its contents.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any one carrying my kind of purses.</li>
    <li> I bought one purse organizer for myself and one for my sister.  I was disappointed with the construction of the pockets and liner.  The inside pockets were very loose and floppy and the liner did not attach to the inside bottom of the organizer.  I have had previous purse organizers which had elastic at the pockets creating a nicer appearance and held any inserted items in place.  My sister LOVED her organizer, it was her first.  I returned the item without any problems.  The company was very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Price was good, as was the quality good, fit all the items I needed it to hold. All in all &amp;#34; an excellent make your life a little easier item&amp;#34; . I would recommend the Britney Handbag Purse Tote to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item. I change purses often and it&#x27;s not easy to find an organizer that has space all my stuff and that&#x27;s stylish. I really love this one. It&#x27;s a beautiful work horse. The fact that is can expand is a big bonus. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> The organizer arrived just as pictured and is the perfect size for my needs. It could stand to be a bit sturdier but it has been holding up fine so far.</li>
    <li> The design is great!  The quality is materials is horrible!  The zipper broke on the first &amp;#34;zip&amp;#34;.  The zipper is extremely small and flimsy.  The inside fabric is also flimsy.  This would be a 5 star if interior materials were up to par as the design would be very useable.  Because of the extremely thin fabric it is difficult to use and I feel it rates a 1 star.</li>
    <li> At first I really loved this handbag tote - it&#x27;s roomy with lots of pockets, cute cheetah-print interior/black satin exterior, and easy to switch in and out of handbags - until the small handles broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take long. The ends just frayed so within a couple of months, the handles were not usable anymore.  So it generally just sits in that one handbag now.  It&#x27;s a good purse organizer but as a tote, it fails.  Too bad, it has the potential to be a great product that I&#x27;d buy multiples of for gifts.</li>
    <li> The organizer is very nice quality and attractive but it does not work for 90% of my purses because it is too small or to big.  I am returning  and will shop for a different brand.</li>
    <li> Love it. Fits perfectly inside my medium sized Longchamp le pilage tote. The tote itself doesn&#x27;t have any organization pockets so it&#x27;s such a space saver. Quality is fair. The zipper on the inside is pretty flimsy but everything else is durable. I like that the bottom is padded so it gives my purse shape.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I initially saw this tote because the leopard print was so pretty, the material felt nice and silky to the touch, and the tote has plenty and plenty of pocket space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, within just a couple of weeks of using it, I began to notice a lot of loose threads tearing from the material.  Almost immediately after that, the zipper broke off when I tried zipping it shut!  Very soon after that, I noticed a huge hole in one of the bottom pocket departments...and all of this happened within 3 weeks of my beginning to use this purse!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT RECOMMEND that anyone purchase this product...please, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and waste your money. :-(</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic item and a great value.  The pockets are wonderful and the handles make it very easy to nice from one handbag to the next</li>
    <li> I have had this gem for months and it is in the same condition as when received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds all my essentials and ensures my totes retain their shape.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described, and very much worth the price. I change bags almost daily because I use one bag for all of my work and personal items. This makes it so simple, now I&#x27;m only shifting my laptop, notebook and this. It&#x27;s very light weight, but be mindful of the measurements as it&#x27;s not one that will fit in smaller purses. I love it!</li>
    <li> I just got mine on the mail last night. I bought it because I like to change purses a lot and I find it a hassle to start moving all my stuff from one purse to another, also you avoid having your purse floor all dirty and ruined. It looks very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 oversized handbags and just knew in advance that they&#x27;d be flopping over and wouldn&#x27;t stand up. So, I purchased one handbag insert and use it for both totes. It&#x27;s the best thing ever. It has so many pockets to hold everything I own, and it has large pockets as well for the rest of my stuff. I&#x27;ve had this insert for quite a while and would not be able to use my large totes without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I love it! It is a great idea as switching from one purse to another is such a big pain. This inset allows you to switch from one purse to another in a matter of seconds. One os the best parts is that it is made silk and satin, which makes it perfect for luxury handbags, I purchased a Coach Handbag it is medium size satchel and it fits perfectly and protects my investment as you can find purses on line that are being sold with pen marks or other stains. I would like to protect my handbag do that I can get the maximum profit. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This comes in so handy.  Things don&#x27;t get all jumbled up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from all the wonderful reviews. It showed up and was a bit smaller than what I expected. The pockets puff out a bit. I immediately filled all the pockets and thought it was going to work great. After about 2 wks one of the Pockets came unstiched :( I decided to order a better quality one from etsy as all the ones here are on amazon are all cheaply made. Great idea though just poorly made.</li>
    <li> This a great organizer. It fits my purse and holds all of the items that I carry in a purse. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this, it makes changing purses easier and finding items in my purse easier.  I am so much more organized and can carry various types of purses since obtaining this item.</li>
    <li> poor quality, very thin fabric that will rip apart soon</li>
    <li> I needed an organizer that would fit two larger handbags and this was a terrific choice.  It adds a nice bit of useful structure to my unstructured hobo. Everything I had in my purse (phone, keys, lipstick, eye drops, wallet, pens, etc.) is now so easy to find; I also have plenty of room for more.  The six pockets inside are a definite improvement over the two slip pockets the purse has, and having them means I can use the zippered interior purse pocket for just things that I prefer to keep tucked away.  Also, the pockets on the organizer are all of a size that allows flexibility in where you put things.  The only thing I am not sure about is the functionality of the exterior pockets as they seem too stiff to get much in them, but I suspect they will stretch with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is attractive and well constructed; the handles are definitely a plus.  I was a little concerned that the leopard lining would make it difficult to see things immediately, but that is not the case at all.  This organizer is much better than a lot of similar items even those in the same price range.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Overall, I was very happy with this organizer. I do wish the inside pockets had some type of closure, because small items do fall out. But still a great organizer for the price!</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose, would have been better if it was made out of a canvas material and just keep its shape when it&#x27;s not loaded up with a bunch of stuff. It&#x27;s hard to place back some things after removing them, it kinda collapse after taking something out.</li>
    <li> Although this tote is for makeup, I use it for my 10.5 x 6.5 tablet.  I love the solid construction and the additional pockets inside.</li>
    <li> Fits pretty good in all my purse! Looks really good great! I can put all my stuff in it and still be able to find what I need. Would recommend. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these &amp; absolutely love them.  I have one  in my purse &amp; one in my workbag to organize everything.  Very handy!  The sides are just stiff enough to hold up &amp; they do not collapse inside your bag.  I will definitely purchase these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great capacity, plenty of dividers. Since it is expandable is very versatile. I highly recommend this organizer.&lt;br /&gt;Love my purse organizer !</li>
    <li> It does fit all my handbags,and it is elegant. I like the partitions,the lining is very pretty,finally I can find my car keys</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and it&#x27;s allowed me to carry many more of my great handbags because switching bags is SO easy!  I particularly love this one for my tote bags and vacationing.  It has a luxurious feel and fabulous compartments.</li>
    <li> This is a cheaper version of the popular brand (Pursen), and it is just as good.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I now love my huge, sack-like purse thanks to this item! It keeps my purse organized so I&#x27;m not endlessly digging &amp; frustrated.  The product arrived quickly &amp; in excellent condition. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item has made all the difference in making my large-size handbag organized and user friendly. No more digging around in the bottom of my purse, searching endlessly for a particular item. Seller gives the utmost care in customer service. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;LOVE THIS ORGANIZER! I am amazed at how easy it is to find things in a large purse with this product. I received the order in 4 days and that was over a weekend! Excellent service and excellent product! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Very handy for my large purses. Happy with the purchase. 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m not sure how sturdy the fabric is going to be. Also lining is a little too satiny for me. If it holds up well, it will be a good value.</li>
    <li> This product is made with inferior materials, poorly designed and flimsy. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the fabric and the zipper are cheap cheap cheap. Broken zipper after a few zips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the fabric pockets droop and sag like 10 year old panties. It was a nightmare trying to put things in the pockets because the fabric is so flimsy it buckles (it has no support).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the design is shortsighted. While the number of pockets is adequate, it&#x27;s much too shallow for the average handbag. The leopard print is a terrible choice for a liner. You can&#x27;t see your things in the pockets because the print camouflages small items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT buy this again nor recommend it. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Great organizer........</li>
    <li> zipper broke the first week! :( needless to say I was very disappointed. looking to buy another organizer from kiwi now</li>
    <li> This is what I needed for my purse. I was already organized but this puts my stuff where Im not having to go through all my stuff in my purse to find keys or a phone cause as soon as you put your keys and phone in it goes right to the bottom of your purse not no more. Thank you ( :</li>
    <li> This item could be improved if the inner sections were not cloth as they don&#x27;t stand up and the items in my purse get mixed up. The inner sections should be made of something like cloth covered hard plastic or even cardboard for that matter.  It is a good size for a large purse but again, the sections are a flimsy cloth that don&#x27;t really keep all items in the organizer separate.</li>
    <li> I also keep one sitting on my dresser to hold items that I don&#x27;t always carry every time but want them kept together and easily accessible.</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer-why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner!!  Makes everything so easy to find and switching bags is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> using this for my motorcycle. This one is being used as an overnight trip. I have packed up cosmetics and toiletries and can just put it in the saddlebag with out packing up a bag!</li>
    <li> Received my Britney tote today -- earlier than stated -- and I love it.  It fits perfect in my Burberry bag and will make it so much more convenient to change bags from now on.  Plenty of pockets and seems to be well constructed!</li>
    <li> Although there were several organizers in local stores, I relied on the comments of other consumers before purchasing this product.  Maybe it was just the unit I received but I felt the product was inferior in construction.  Although large enough to hold what was needed, I wish I would have purchased one that was expandable.  This was a little too wide for my needs.  On the third day of use, the \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; zipper was no so hidden.  I saw some fraying when the unit was received and should have returned it.  Limited on time, I used the product and by the third day the zipper was jammed in the fray and eventually became useless.  Next time, I will purchase items like this locally.</li>
    <li> First if all it is really made well. I would have chosen a sturdier material if I had thought. It&#x27;s a silky material and I need a tougher material. I use it all the tim though and highly recommend the item. I chose four stars because of the silky material</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size for everything but the kitchen sink.&lt;br /&gt;It fits in larger purses, not smaller.  I can always use more pockets, I wish it had, to easily find the essentials.</li>
    <li> I love this! No more searching through my purse for things I need (unless those things fall under this tote)! Great, but the material on the inside (the leopard print) is already starting to fray. The material does not hold up with repeated use (and I use this everyday). I would buy another if they lasted longer, but I can&#x27;t see spending this kind of money on something that will just fall apart within a few months. It would be better if the material on the inside was just as tough as the material on the outside.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be too small for my coach Ashley bag (smaller version) but it fit just right! When I use it for my bigger tote, works perfectly since I can still use the actual bag itself for extra pockets. Would def recommend this to all women who like to switch pocketbooks. You always know where all your items are! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> The Britney handbag purse tote is perfect for women who have multiple purses but are short on patience. Sick of not finding your stuff? This bag organizer will help you. I saw more expensive transferrable purse organizers but after using this one, I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;d need them. The lining of this organizer is good looking (leopard print!). It&#x27;s satin so everything glides in and out (TWSS!). It&#x27;s small enough to fit most purses. It&#x27;s got lots of organizational dividers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the positives can be a negative, so I&#x27;ll share it here just so you know: The bottom of the organizer is stiff and so sits on a flat surface when expanded. However, this stiff bottom can change the shape of your purse especially if it&#x27;s more of a pouchy bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good value and useful.  I recommend it for all the bag ladies in your life.</li>
    <li> This is the most lead astray online reviews have taken me EVER. This thing had stunning reviews but it literally is made of the most delicate and flimsy material EVER. I honestly would not be surprised if the material gets runs in it because it isn&#x27;t much more sturdy than pantyhose. I will use it while it last because it is cheap enough (and would probably cost more to ship it back than the item itself). I am looking for something else because I am not sure how long it will hold up.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this organizer. The size is great, not to big, not to small, everything fits. I love the way it looks, sleek and designer. It doesn&#x27;t look utilitarian and I like that. I would recommend this product for any ladies who have \\&quot;open\\&quot; purses and can never find anything.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic...after doing some research I decided on this brand and am very happy. It&#x27;s made of a high quality and very pleasing to the eye. I use it in my Prada and Channel handbags.</li>
    <li> Inside ripped after 1 week</li>
    <li> Bag is smaller than I thought. Cannot be closed. I have larger tote bags and it looks tiny in all of them. I was very disappointed with the product in general, did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> After sorting through hundreds of these purse inserts online, I bought this one because it was the right size and definitely the right price. Ignore all the overpriced versions on Etsy that cost $40+ and get this one! There are a lot of pockets (2x on each inner surface, 1x stretchy pockets on each side, 1x flat pocket on the two outer surfaces, and one wide zippered pocket on the inside. There&#x27;s also a stretchy band on the inside to help anchor whatever you may need. The inside cloth is thin and soft while the outer panels are very stiff so it maintains a pretty rectangular shape instead of collapsing on itself. This also helps your purse maintain its shape if it otherwise slouches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three major reasons that I would recommend this product over others: 1) best price, 2) zippered pocket, 3) many evenly sized pockets. 3) expandable option. I also appreciate that the pockets are made without attempting to predict whatever you want to put in them because I might want to have four pens when there are only two pen slots, but some people might want the different sizes more. A lot of purse inserts don&#x27;t have a zippered pocket unlike this one; the zippered pocket helps you cart around things you don&#x27;t want to be visible every time you open up your purse such as pills, contraception, etc. The expandable option is really nice because it not only lets you use it for differently sized purses, but you can also use the insert unexpanded to leave room books or an iPad to the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are 1) the polyester silky cat print inside which seems cheap to me and 2) lack of smaller pockets. I wish there was at least one smaller pocket, preferably zippered, because sometimes I need a place to store a pair of earrings or something else small that I don&#x27;t want to lose as it swims around in my cavernous purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I am so satisfied with this product. It is well constructed. It helps keep all your items in view and in place. I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Was okay but It needs to be taller... Didn&#x27;t realize how shallow it was.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy so far, wishing it was a little larger, it has definitely helped me to keep things together better.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> While I thought this was a great item when I first purchased it, it did not last very long. The inside zipper busted within a 3 weeks of purchase. I am now ordering a different type.</li>
    <li> All things considered, this wasn&#x27;t a bad buy. However, I absolutely hated the interior. The fabric used for all of the inside,  including the pockets,  was thin and easy to tear. They used this same material for the divider down the middle which, due to its flimsy-Ness,  would just end up collapsing to the bottom. I say this for all purse organizers out there: if you&#x27;re messy in your purse without it,  you&#x27;ll still be messy with it. I liked the idea of just pulling it out to change purses, but usually the whole thing would end up folded or shoved to the side, and nothing stayed in it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I LOVE purses and have many of them.  Now I can actually switch them out and use them more often.  This little &amp;#34;bucket&amp;#34; is dandy!  Makes switching much more simpler.  Also... if your purse is large and you are constantly digging around, this will solve it.  I don&#x27;t really care that much in my purses, but I love the look of a big bag, well this makes my stuff a lot easier to find in the VAST purses I sometimes carry!</li>
    <li> The purse I recently purchased was large and open (not like the multi-pockets I&#x27;m use to). This little gem helped organize everything again so nicely, I recommended it to a friend of mine who was looking for the exact same thing (just didn&#x27;t know where to get it...she knows now). :)</li>
