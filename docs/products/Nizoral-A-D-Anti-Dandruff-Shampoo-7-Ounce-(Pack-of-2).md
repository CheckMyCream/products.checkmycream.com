    <li> Excellent product. Tried all of the OTC anti-dandruff shampoos, but this is the only one that worked for me on a consistent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that they&#x27;d make the shampoo in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I used to have a very itchy scalp and Nizoral definitely helped. Results like from prescription shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that helped my dandruff caused by PCOS. Results have been amazing!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this ketoconazole shampoo. I switch to [[ASIN:B0032FSDOA Regenepure Dr hair loss shampoo]] which is a better ketoconazole shampoo and a lot more gentle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> My son loves this shampoo.  Uses it every other wash.</li>
    <li> You also can use this product for acne treatment ( face,back and chest) which is called : seborrheic folliculitis so check it out also on Google and you sill see here is the link [...]</li>
    <li> So far so good. Like how its over the counter. Fast and smooth transaction. Will definitely look to purchase in the near future.</li>
    <li> Thankfully can buy it now it was once on the shelf</li>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo yet!  We have tried every anti-dandruff shampoo out there. Never tried this one because it&#x27;s much more pricey than normal shampoo. Finally decided to go with it, and this is the second pack we bought now. It works wonders!!  Do make sure to condition the hair (not rub into the scalp) after using the shampoo since it does dry the hair more than normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> A little does a lot. Good product.</li>
    <li> Have been using Nizoral for years. It keeps my psoriasis on my scalp in check. Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for actual skin conditions not just dandruff.  Great for people and dogs. Same active ingredient in medicated dog shampoo.</li>
    <li> I used this in the past, but could no longer find it in the pharmacy.  Love how well and quickly it works to get rid of flaky, itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Its very good product....</li>
    <li> I notice results on the first three shampoo. Scalp stop itching, no dry flakes, and hair remains soft, refresh, and healthy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Legit product, good price</li>
    <li> Good Work. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with Dandruff (at least that is what i think it is) and over the counter shampoos do not even touch it.  After about two weeks of using this for 4-5 times a week, it drastically improved.  It can be tough to get some points as supply seems shaky, but for me is worth it.  Have tried some other shampoos with the same active ingredient and they did not perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know many people use this for hair growth, but cannot really comment on that ability as that is not a struggle of mine thankfully.</li>
    <li> Always a great product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that helps me with scalp itch.  The buying experience was wonderful and the product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Great service, Nizoral is great shampoo for psoriasis.</li>
