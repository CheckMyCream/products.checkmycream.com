      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like plastic wrap.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Really nice to have.</li>
      <li>They are just like the kind you&#x27;d find at a hotel.</li>
      <li>light weight and cheaply made - works perfect for single-use conditioning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results of how it works, no need for fancy when dying it</li>
      <li>I was Ok with the fact that these are fairly disposable, but I have shoulder length hair and when I put it up and under-  </li>
      <li>they do not compare to the kind they have in hotels at all...</li>

      <li>Does exactly what I need it to do and for a great price.</li>
      <li>Sure, but I&#x27;m giving them 5 stars because for the price, and</li>

      <li>I should have known better.</li>

      <li>It is more like material of the plastic used to make plastic grocery bags.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even use more than 3 Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
      <li>Sincerely yours; Georgia  </li>
      <li>Thank you I love these compact caps.</li>
      <li>There are so many of them that you won&#x27;t run out for awhile...</li>
      <li>Ok for the price though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with these shower caps.</li>
      <li>glad I did.</li>
      <li>Much better than buying a fancy one that needs to washed often to get the odor out of them.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these things.</li>
      <li>I got better ones at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I ordered A LOT of these -- probably more than I needed.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel even more ripped off.  </li>
      <li>The price was ok</li>
      <li>, then it&#x27;s ok to buy these.</li>
      <li>I gave this a 3 star rating because I thought they would be heavier more like what I would get at a hotel</li>
      <li>They are the weight of food wrap and won&#x27;t work more than once if they don&#x27;t rip putting them on.</li>
      <li>I have not looked at all of them, but hope I have more than two caps that I will be able to use.</li>
      <li>Price was right and good quality.  </li>
      <li>I would not purchase again, they are cheap and rip very easily.  </li>
      <li>super cheap for a reason!!</li>
      <li>Very, very, cheap and easily tore apart when trying to separate them.  </li>
      <li>I wanted large good quality shower caps.  </li>
      <li>they are so many for so cheap...</li>
      <li>They keep the water out, but if you have a lot of hair you may not be able to fit it all inside the cap.</li>
      <li>They are flimsy and tear easily.</li>
      <li>so they break easily.</li>
      <li>They took forever to arrive and they rip easy.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;you can pack them easily and dispose them easily</li>
      <li>I love them, great for multiple uses, then just replace.</li>
      <li>They feel sort of papery and rip easily.</li>
      <li>Probably a lot more than I needed in the package, but they are very convenient to have in each bathroom for guests as well as having them handy for myself.</li>
      <li>If you can wait they are fine.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s fine..</li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipping, item is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>They are so fine, I just chucked them out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They were very small and very thin.  I got better ones at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> they are so many for so cheap...</li>
    <li> Do not buy..I wish I could rate this product with negative stars..they arrived super late ok that&#x27;s fine..I open the package to find that it&#x27;s just cheap plastic. The moment I tried to put the &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; shower cap over my head it ripped so I tried another one &amp; the same thing happened.very disappointing.</li>
    <li> About as expected.  I just wanted something that was not bulky.  Same quality you would get from most hotel around the country.</li>
    <li> Super flimsy, for small heads and hair, not what I expected at all.  Very similar to what you find in hotels.  Barely good for one use.  The price has come down a lot since I bought them and they are really cheap right now.  Makes me feel even more ripped off.  I would NOT buy them again.  I would definitely not recommend them (unless you need a lot of one time use disposable shower caps.  Maybe they are good as dish covers.  And actually at the new price, approximately 8 cents each, maybe they are worth it)</li>
    <li> exactly as described. worked great for me to use as hair conditioning nets.  Thought it took a bit long to get although still well within expecting time line but after receiving and finding out the long distance they traveled from - understood why and happy to get</li>
    <li> Love how these caps look when you take one out in front of my clients and they ask, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that in your hand, I&#x27;ve never seen you use that before&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s when I tell them it&#x27;s your conditioning cap....... Lol I love these üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with these shower caps.There simple little shower caps that do the job for a fair price. You get thirty to a pack, can&#x27;t beat that either.</li>
    <li> If you need something quick - I recommend going the store. If you can wait - say 3 weeks to a month, then it&#x27;s ok to buy these. They are shipped from Hong Kong. They are thin, but that&#x27;s ok. Will last for a 1st time use - maybe a second time. Price is good.</li>
    <li> the product is very poor.</li>
    <li> Shower caps are of much thinner material than Hotel shower caps but do the trick.  Probably won&#x27;t last as long as hotels.</li>
    <li> Be prepared to have somewhere to put them because all 30 of them arrive is a regular ol&#x27; shipping package.  I bought a few months ago and I&#x27;m still using the first one.</li>
    <li> The ENTIRE pack of these shower caps were faulty - the elastic broke immediately on every single one, making them useless as shower caps and barely useful as food covers. Landfill. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time waiting for them. They were all crammed into a package smaller than a ziplock Baggie. Some were ripped inside, which leads to how thin and cheap they are. The elastic rips when you&#x27;re trying to put them on because of how thin they are. I just wanted them for protecting my hair as I was painting, drywalling, etc so I feel bad for anyone wanting these to perform for any traditional cap uses.</li>
    <li> The new shower caps are folded and pressed so that they take less space to ship. I was surprised to see the small package that arrived but it is all good. The new elastic band didn&#x27;t go all around the perimeter of the shower cap. Not sure if the gap will keep moisture out though. I like using this disposable cap when I&#x27;m coloring my hair.  Updated 4/18/2015: After a few months using this product, I must say the manufacturer needs to improve on the sewing of the elastic band. It&#x27;s not sewn properly and always leave a gap here and there which allows moisture to seep in on first used.</li>
    <li> These are pretty terrible.  I didn&#x27;t think you could mess up a cheap disposable shower cap but after buying these, I know it can be done!  The functionality of these is as-expected (I use for hair treatments, deep conditioning, etc) but the plastic material these are made of smells AWFUL.  Every time I use one of these I feel like I am being poisoned.  I store them in not one but TWO zip lock bags so the smell does not take over my storage cabinet.  They are so cheap, I should just throw them out but I use them so infrequently I never think about it until I need to use one.</li>
    <li> These shower caps are quite small -- at least half ripped the first time I put them on (the plastic pulls away from the elastic) -- and I have shoulder length hair (not thick, either).  I was looking for something a little sturdier, like a standard hotel shower cap in a box, which I would happily have paid a little more for.  These are only lasting a few showers each, vs. a hotel-type cap which is larger and sturdier and may last for a month or more.</li>
    <li> 2 nd time ordering this product. they work perfectly for our needs.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This was a rip-off.  I can&#x27;t complain since I read some of the reviews ahead of time, but since I was looking for small shower caps and I do have a very small head and can wear children&#x27;s large, I thought they might work.  First, they come looking like a squiggly  3-or 4&amp;#34; long by 1/2&amp;#34; wide looking piece of ribbon. When you try to unravel it, it tears up! I know some things work for some people but I can&#x27;t imagine any use for these in any way, expecially since they are so hard to unravel.</li>
    <li> I got a good long use of these - very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, tear so easy</li>
    <li> Be very careful when you open one of these interestingly packaged caps. I use them to keep dye out of my way when showering and they&#x27;re great. I have long hair and have to put a large clip in it, but the cap covers well with decent elastic.</li>
    <li> Disposable shower caps, one time use...but didn&#x27;t even get one use.  Went through three, all of them ripped around the elastic the instant I tried to put them on...and I have short hair, no long hair I was trying to tuck up in.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I needed some plain shower caps and that is what I got. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either.! You can&#x27;t go wrong with these...</li>
    <li> Too small and flimsy. They also took three weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> I love using these little plastic hair caps for at home deep conditioning treatments!  The fit around the face nicely and are roomy enough for medium to long hair.  They are great to use as a regular shower cap too!</li>
    <li> The material is not like that of regular shower caps. It is more like material of the plastic used to make plastic grocery bags.</li>
    <li> These arrive looking like a small bag of trash, but if you pull on each &amp;#34;shred&amp;#34; it opens up to become a shower cap. They are not very snug and obviously meant to be used only one time. They are good for wrapping up one&#x27;s hair during hair coloring. There are so many of them that you won&#x27;t run out for awhile...</li>
    <li> Shipped from China, these shower caps are quite thin and small. They will just barely fit over the average sized head with very short hair, but if your hat size is over 7 1/2 or you have lots of hair, I doubt these will work for you. Expect it to take 3-4 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Good price for functional shower and coloring caps. Would recommend. The elastic seems to be good enough to use several times.</li>
    <li> Long wait but great product (quantity) to have.</li>
    <li> waay too thin. very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for a shower cap that could be used a couple of times, but these are cheap.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> super cheap for a reason!! took a very long time to get here (I had no idea they were in China)&lt;br /&gt;These are the these caps I have ever seen in my life! i thought they would be like the ones you get at a hotel, ummm no. These are about 3x as thin which is hard to conceive.</li>
    <li> Good but arrived later than expected.</li>
    <li> This product is not for you. It does not protect your hair from getting wet whilst showering. I have to use two of these shower caps in order to get a decent coverage.</li>
    <li> Good quality..package was delivered in 12 days. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Definitely not hotel shower cap quality. Extremely thin, about 1/3 or even 1/4 of a standard hotel shower cap. Only arrived 6 weeks after ordering. Had to throw away right after as there were dead bugs in the package.</li>
    <li> The shower caps are surprising and excellent.</li>
    <li> good quality.  They last a very long time without the elastic giving way.  Am very happy with them and would recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is what we were looking for. However, the delivery took several months, which we did not realize until the order was made. If you can wait they are fine.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, but not something I would buy again. They took forever to arrive and they rip easy. I have very thick hair so I have to use two just to cover my hair and they still rip when I do (around the owning part).</li>
    <li> I will never buy thing from this store ever. It was extremely thin, and tore before it was even worn. Will never go for cheaper stuff, will invest a little more, and get stuff that&#x27;s better in quality.</li>
    <li> They did not work for the purpose for which I bought them-- to cover bowls of food:  they are too big, and very hard to clean, once used.  But again, that is not the fault of the product, as they were (probably) not intended for such a use.</li>
    <li> Low cost shower caps.  Lead time a little long, and packaging is questionable - but they are cheap - and work.</li>
    <li> A little thinner than I was expecting but I don&#x27;t see any reason these wont work for what the intention is.</li>
    <li> These are for one time use. But yet poor Quality</li>
    <li> I have natural 4c hair and I attempted to use this as a deep conditioning treatment cap that I can use and toss out. My hair was parted in 4 sections and twisted. There were no clips or accessories in my hair. The cap tore and just from my hair poking through while attempting to put it on. It will not cover your hair fully. I have a small head and it should have fit but didn&#x27;t. The shipping was long but I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use some medicated stuff on my scalp overnight once or twice a month.  I use these shower caps and throw them away.  Perfect.  Some have complained about the size.  I wear a 7 1/2 hat.  No problems.  My hair is short.  I suppose if you had a lot of hair it might be an issue.  The one weird thing is that they come stuffed in an envelope.  Fair enough.  They&#x27;re cheap.  I guess I don&#x27;t really  need a box for them.</li>
    <li> Very thin plastic, it ripped as I was putting it on....I guess you get what you pay for. Spend the extra $$$ and get good quality items.</li>
    <li> The shower caps were in bundles - the bundles were ties with rubber bands which felt sticky.  Overall quality didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
    <li> You guys that are complaining these shower caps rip when you open them must not be doing it right.  You are supposed to pull the elastic away from the elastic, *not* the plastic away from the plastic.  I&#x27;ve opened all 30 of these and the only one that ripped was one that I opened in an impatient hurry and my finger slipped off of the elastic band and grabbed the plastic instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they flimsy? Sure, but I&#x27;m giving them 5 stars because for the price, and my need, they are a perfect solution.  Full disclosure: I am not using them as shower caps, I am using them as dust covers for small buckets of unused trinkets, knick knacks, and sewing paraphernalia.  And for that, they are awesome.  Also heads up to you horse people out there, they work perfect to cover a small 6 qt feedbucket.  Keeps the flies and barn dirt out of your horse&#x27;s food if you prepare your horse&#x27;s meals ahead of time, leaving them for a groom to feed later or whatever.  You can reuse them several times before they rip, and at .06 cents each, it&#x27;s not a tragedy when they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve been so useful, I&#x27;m ordering several more packets right now!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These are too small to fit an adult head and are so flimsy they tear when you try to put them on. Total junk and not worth even the little you pay for them.</li>
    <li> These plastic caps are WAY TOO SMALL! - Could hardly fit a baby&#x27;s head &amp; VERY thin cheap plastic.Very Dissapointed, wont buy again.</li>
    <li> These are useless. They might fit a baby&#x27;s or a doll&#x27;s head, but not any of the fat heads in our house.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit to head proparly.</li>
    <li> these were nothing like the description.  They are very very small.  Would be very suitable for small children.  did not fit my head at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for children sizes they would be great,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tossed them out.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I don&#x27;t use them for shower caps, I use them to cover bowls that are going in the fridge. Fits lots of different sizes and so much easier than plastic wrap!!</li>
    <li> you can use once or twice and throw away because the elastic breaks... just so you know</li>
    <li> HUNK OF JUNK ... Doesn&#x27;t even cover my whole head. Shipping was like a slow boat from China!</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 star rating because I thought they would be heavier more like what I would get at a hotel but they are working for me</li>
    <li> light weight and cheaply made - works perfect for single-use conditioning. i, however, prefer to reuse mine as many times as possible so as not to be as wasteful. won&#x27;t work with these.</li>
    <li> These are fairly horrible, they wont fit my head and barely fits my daughters who is four. They are very thin, torn, improperly stitched, crooked, anything that can be wrong with a simple shower cap is wrong with these. I luckily only ordered the 30 count for about $4.00 including shipping or else I would return them. It took 3 times to get one on my toddlers head without it tearing. In other words 1 bath 3 shower caps lol&lt;br /&gt;yeah avoid- unless you will be happy if just a few can be of use.</li>
    <li> God within the price tag.</li>
    <li> For a small amount of money, I&#x27;m able to have fresh shower caps whenever I want them. Much better than buying a fancy one that needs to washed often to get the odor out of them.</li>
    <li> To me these are great. They snug your head so no water gets in and the price was great so I am very happy with them</li>
    <li> The first cap I used got tear up while I have it on my hair. The plastic that it&#x27;s made of, it&#x27;s thinner than a grocery bag. They fit really small on my head and I am only 5&amp;#34; tall.</li>
    <li> They rip when you open them.</li>
    <li> The plastic on these caps are very thin.  They are also very small.  It works for me though. I have a small (childlike) head, so I don&#x27;t have a problem with the size.  I have to double the caps if I don&#x27;t want to get my soak-in-wet in the shower.  If you have an average adult head - do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. the caps or small, I have a small head and shorthair and they still don&#x27;t fit me. I had to wear two of them in the shower in order to cover my whole head. If you try to stretch them to cover your head they just rip apart. I am very dissatisfied and do not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> It is cheap. It keeps your hair dry. It does what it is supposed to. How else are you supposed to review disposable shower caps?</li>
    <li> perfect for cheap people with small heads. Its a chinese special, get what you pay for - this stuff is garbage - already threw them out</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed!  These come all rolled up, so you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting until you go to use one.  I am a very little person and it wouldn&#x27;t even cover my whole head.  It barely fit my 2 year old.  I bought these to use for spray tanning, but I don&#x27;t spray babies, so they&#x27;re useless!</li>
    <li> These are small and flimsy but for the price and quantity I am happy with them. I use them for shower caps, my hair is long and thick. I like that they are clear so I don&#x27;t look like an old lady using them. The order did take a long time to arrive but it got delivered inside the allowed time.</li>
    <li> The caps were not what  I had ordered.  I wanted large good quality shower caps.  They were small of inferior quality and I had to throw them away.</li>
    <li> I use these to fit the 9 1/2&amp;#34; opening on both ends of my telescope.  I have the cap for it, but it still collects dust inside.  These work very well for this.</li>
    <li> This product was cheap and inconsistently sized.  Most caps were way to small!!!  The price was ok but I guess you get what you pay for.  I would not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> The shower caps are made of a very thin material (much thinner then the type you get in hotels), it works for a while. Ok for the price though.</li>
    <li> The quality isn&#x27;t quite what you get from the hotel ones, but these do the job. They took about three weeks to get to me. I wear these on non-wash days so I don&#x27;t have to dry and re-straighten my hair and whenever I do a face mask so I don&#x27;t get it in my hair. They last 5-10 uses before the elastic wears out. Does exactly what I need it to do and for a great price. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great! Each individual cap is the size of a dime or so, they are folded up so tightly in the package when you get them. Amazing price. They are very thin plastic, designed for just one use, but I reuse them for the shower at least a few times. Amazing how small they are, added a few to my travel bag too!</li>
    <li> I bought these as disposable shower caps for travel. I expected them to be thin, and they are--very--but the weight/thickness would be ok for that use -- if only they would fit over hair rollers --which they won&#x27;t. You would need to use two or three caps to fit over hair rollers, so plan for that. But these caps should work perfectly well if you have very short hair or just pin your hair up off your neck on those days when you want to keep it dry. And, as their product info says -- you can also use them for shoe covers in your suitcase. They arrive in a little &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; of individually-folded, rubber-banded caps -- a little like pop-up sponges. So you could just pop a couple of the compact little &amp;#34;squares&amp;#34; of caps into your suitcase or cosmetics case.</li>
    <li> These made in China shower caps are absolute junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;They are so small that they will not fit a grown ups head. They rip when&lt;br /&gt;You put them on. I&#x27;m really trying to not buy Chinese stuff.</li>
    <li> Great shower caps at a great value. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are labeled \\&quot;Processing Caps.\\&quot; Will keep hair dry and unfrizzy only if I don&#x27;t accidentally get hit by water from the shower head. They&#x27;re super flimsy. Cheaper than a disposable hotel shower cap.</li>
    <li> I use shower caps a lot,was tired of having a shower cap laying around.When I saw these throw aways,I grabbed them .So glad I did.</li>
    <li> I kind of knew the quality is not good base on the price, but i thought it maybe good for one time use.&lt;br /&gt;When i tried to use it, just by open it up a bit, it broke right the way.  either thought it seems very small, can&#x27;t fix my head. please note that my head is not big.xd</li>
    <li> It is too small, and just came bundled together. Not ssatisfied. I didn&#x27;t even use more than 3 Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping, item is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!!! Perfect to use in the refrigerator!</li>
    <li> This product is fine as long as you know what you&#x27;re getting.  If you think you&#x27;re getting a little hotel-style shower cap, easy to use several times (or more) then throw away, then you&#x27;ll be disappointed by these. I use that kind for traveling as they wad up to nearly nothing and you can use them over and over.  The plastic on these however is an order of magnitude thinner than those.  It&#x27;s kind of like plastic wrap.  Using one of these more than once would depend on you using extreme care putting it on and taking it off.  But if you truly do only need something to use just once, these would be OK.  Like if you were doing some sort of treatment on your hair or something.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe there were 30 caps in the small package. They are the weight of food wrap and won&#x27;t work more than once if they don&#x27;t rip putting them on. Oh well, like I said they were cheeeaaaap.</li>
    <li> You have to wait a little while longer, but its a great buy def.</li>
    <li> I got this for dying my hair &amp; it works great!  I&#x27;m thrilled with the results of how it works, no need for fancy when dying it</li>
    <li> I think thsy are a great item. I just wish they were a little larger. as i use them on my cooking bowles</li>
    <li> Every time I pick one up it has holes. It took forever to get these back and I was really anticipating a great deal of good quality but these are a WASTE of money!!!!</li>
    <li> This caps are not big enough to cover my hair from front to back. They are flimsy and tear easily. I have product in my hair and do not want my pillow cases to get stained so I THOUGHT these would be great...NOT the case for me. I may have to just use them in the shower but then again, I would have to use 2 just to cover my head. For the price I paid I won&#x27;t say they are completely useless, I will say for me, they are probably better to use in the kitchen and not on my hair.</li>
    <li> A little small to hold all my hair but overall they do a good job.30 count shower caps.  thank you.</li>
    <li> This will fit on my biggest cat head ... Not even my 7 y.o. daughter don&#x27;t use them in shower because are too small.</li>
    <li> Only because they are super small. If this is stated in the description I must of missed it I have a ample head size and a Afro hair it doesn&#x27;t quite fit all my hair when loose have to twist up in order for caps to fit. They won&#x27;t work if my hair grows a little more.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase again, they are cheap and rip very easily.  My wife has to pretty much wear two to cover her hair.</li>
    <li> These caps are very cheaply made in China and are very small.  The first one I put on barely fit my head and ripped in three places before I even got in the shower.  Not even worth the small cost.  They are just junk!  I&#x27;m sending them back to the seller for a refund.</li>
    <li> Update 1/3/2015: I re-ordered this product and what came to me this time was very different then what came to me the first time. The quality of these caps have been lowered substantially.     I LOVE these things. I was looking for a cheap, throw away after 1 or 2 uses shower cap for coloring and deep conditioning and that is what I got. If your looking for something really tough and durable that will last a long time, look else where. There is really no cause for complaint here.</li>
    <li> Not a  good purchase.  Too small and fall apart very easily.</li>
    <li> The product serves well as a disposable shower cap.  It is large enough to cover my head and so cheap I can throw it away after a week.  I am only giving it a four because the elastic band is not tight enough.</li>
    <li> this product is unacceptable! it is sized for a child and poor quality!!. I am thankful that I did not waste more money.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but it does the job.</li>
    <li> THese are not a large cap as it is describes.</li>
    <li> Thank you I love these compact caps.</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet, but they seem to be what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Too small for adult head.</li>
    <li> These are much thinner than I expected!  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, I got it for when I dye my hair with henna... but they are similar in thickness to grocery store produce bags.  I wish I had just bought some at a beauty supply.  I guess if you have shorter hair they will be ok.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that these would be like the disposable shower caps one gets in a hotel.  Well - they are similar, but some would only fit a child&#x27;s head comfortably.  Some are very, very small.  I am able to get it on my head, but very tight and completely flattens the hair.  Others are bigger and able to get on head without flattening my hair or giving me a headache from being too tight.  I question the \\&quot;bouffant size\\&quot; advertised.  Price is right, but beware that there is variability in size and some will work and some will not.  I have not looked at all of them, but hope I have more than two caps that I will be able to use.</li>
    <li> The caps were so small that they barely fit an adult head.  If you are looking for childrens shower caps, they would work.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re shower caps. They protect my head when I want to wash my hair every other day while still showering every day. You get a ton of them for not a lot of money. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Not even worth the few dollars I spent, terrible quality , not hotel quality, they just fall apart when you open them</li>
    <li> I use these to cover the bottoms of my shoes when traveling ... it&#x27;s a great way to keep your close clean and not take up extra room with shoe bags.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it negative stars if I could.  Very, very, cheap and easily tore apart when trying to separate them.  You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> too small. horrible quality.</li>
    <li> Price was right and good quality.  I have re-used it several times and it is good as new.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> These are really thin/flimsy, can be used just once, and definitely not for shoes or in the shower (maybe as bowl covers for food service, as their description says). A couple of them tore as I was just taking them out of the package. They were also too small for me (I have medium-length hair that just sits on my shoulders). But considering the cost (that includes shipping costs from HongKong), I wasn&#x27;t expecting top-of-the-line stuff, hence the 3-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was as advertised and arrived on time, just that they didn&#x27;t work for me. I ended up buying a single bigger/stronger shower cap for the same price from a local store (I should have done better research than blindly picking what Amazon said was the top-selling item under &#x27;Shower Caps&#x27;).</li>
    <li> Great for the price. If you have an off-shore seller, like I did, they ship right away, but it takes over a week to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the price. Nice size, not too small, fits my shoulder length hair with room to spare. I use it mainly when I deep condition my hair and when I do home facials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice to have.</li>
    <li> They are very affordable, re-usable and come with a lot.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made from China shower caps. Good for one or two uses only.</li>
    <li> Good amount for price 30 in bag, tight fitting caps, took awhile to arrive 2-3 weeks from over seas.</li>
    <li> These caps are large.  They won&#x27;t crush your hairdo.  After a few uses you can throw them away, so they are a nice, clean choice.  No more pocketing them from the hotels we stay in!</li>
    <li> The caps are pretty thin, can probably be used twice before you gotta throw them out. At least it keeps my hair dry.</li>
    <li> The caps are too small to fit any size of adult head, may only fit new born baby.  Does Amazon have any inspection on the products?  It shouldn&#x27;t be on the market.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE CAPS.  They are tiny and cheaply made.  I am amazed that anyone would give these a good rating.  I have short hair, an average head size, and I can&#x27;t even get the cap to cover my whole head.  They are nothing like the caps you get in hotels.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking to buy 30 shower caps for $1.95.  I did NOT have a problem with the seller, nor did I have a problem with the fact that it took a long time to get the package.  The product traveled a long way to get to me but I was kept notified of the transit progress.  The problem is with the Caps themselves.  They are only big enough to fit a child&#x27;s head, and when I tried to spread it open to put it on, the elastic became detached from the plastic (it ripped), so I tried another cap - same result.  I do NOT have long, thick hair.  Save your $$ and invest in a Dollar Store Shower Cap.  It may be only (1) cap for $1 but at least you&#x27;ll be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I use these for covering items I place in the refrigerator that I have made: salads, main dishes and so on. Like a Saran Wrap, but the elastic edge makes it easier to remove and replace. Cheaper than the same item marketed for this purpose. Reuseable on the same item. Very versatile. I keep a separate set in the bath room for shower time. On days I don&#x27;t wash my hair I place one inside the other and they work well as intended keeping my hair dry. And I can use multiple times</li>
    <li> This is great value and as described but the caps are very small.  I was Ok with the fact that these are fairly disposable, but I have shoulder length hair and when I put it up and under-  the cap still leaves an inch of my hairline exposed.  These would perhaps be better for children or people with tiny tiny heads or super short hair or bald !!!</li>
    <li> Great value! they are a bit small but work really well for conditioning purposes.</li>
    <li> I use these caps for dust covers on my small kitchen appliances and they work great the only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is the elastic wheres out pretty quickly other than that perfect.</li>
    <li> I left only two stars because it took a while to receive it. Otherwise the product is fine for what I wanted, which is to keep my hair dry in the shower. They aren&#x27;t heavy duty or lined, which is fine because I don&#x27;t need that. Comes in a package of 30, so I&#x27;ll have plenty to get me by.</li>
    <li> The elastic is much more secure around the head than a few others I have tried.</li>
    <li> For the price which is fabulous for 30 shower caps which you do get all 30 of them.They are thin but you do get several uses out of one shower cap I will definitely buy again they came sooner than expected</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, some hotels out of the country don&#x27;t have these</li>
    <li> Cheap in quality; none of the shower caps opened, each ripped apart when trying to put them on. Just go to the store and purchase.</li>
    <li> Material a little thin but works great for what I need.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a supply of disposables like the ones sometimes available at hotels, and she&#x27;s very happy with these.  I was very happy with the price.</li>
    <li> useless shower caps. Took about a month to come in and they tear even before u step into shower. Poor quality but given the price, not even worth returning. Going in trash!!</li>
    <li> I bought these as plate covers since my husband works till midnight and I like to keep his dinner covered. They were much less costly than &amp;#34;bowl covers&amp;#34;. Since they usually don&#x27;t get rewashed the size, and the low price make them perfect for my uses.</li>
    <li> works as designed&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this item to anyone who just needs a basic shower cap&lt;br /&gt;would order again</li>
    <li> They are thin but as a disposable cap I don&#x27;t care even if they tear up (which they don&#x27;t) after doing the job. Plus I&#x27;ve got them pretty fast.</li>
    <li> best cheap caps EVER!</li>
    <li> These are to be used when you dye, condition, perm your hair. They are disposable. They do the job well.</li>
    <li> crazy cheap because they are cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Thin plastic, definitely disposable, but for the price, ok.</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose, so I would say the product is worth the buck. a b c d e f g</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money this is garbage</li>
    <li> Keep these in the guest bathroom.  Very practicable.</li>
    <li> When I received them I thought they were the packing material.  They are similar to plastic bags and very thin with elastic only around part of the cap.  Photo is not representative of actual product.</li>
    <li> the quality is cheap but so is the price  it&#x27;s a fair trade&lt;br /&gt;like the fact that they&#x27;re small &amp; thin&lt;br /&gt;you can pack them easily and dispose them easily</li>
    <li> I waited for two weeks for these needed them earlier then that so three start so slow shipping the work well just slow to get to me as they are coming from China</li>
    <li> The size of this cap need to be larger.  With hair and size of the average head this item should be larger</li>
    <li> These are very thin and had a weird chemical scent when I opened the packet. They feel sort of papery and rip easily. You can get a better quality from Walmart for  half the price (15 for 97 cents). I know these are disposable but I can get about two weeks of use from the Wally ones..these barely lasted two uses and ripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also on the smaller side so if you have a lot of hair they will not cover as well. I use shower caps to cover down to my ears on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair and these did not do the job. I also use them to deep condition with a dryer and they could not take the heat like the Wally ones. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> somewhat easily rip, but can&#x27;t say they are worse then the $5 ones for only one. It fits my small head and medium size hair.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It was an awesome deal for the price I paid. The caps fit well and serves its true purpose.  No complaints with product or seller.</li>
    <li> I ordered these strange not to bathe, but baking the dough bowl cover, it is more convenient than fresh food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can choose from the last time I bought a little different look, but they still do the job! They fit perfectly and great in my mind, when I die my hair.</li>
    <li> I thought they&#x27;d be stronger. They are so fine, I just chucked them out.</li>
    <li> Nice caps, but shipping took longer than I thought it should have.</li>
    <li> I like these caps.  I was not sure if they would do what I wanted BUT they did.  What I do, I put curl gel on my hair alot of gel, to where I feel it all the way down to the roots and than I put on a plastic cap and tie a scarf on and say my prayers and read my Bible and go to sleep.  The next morning, the cap is still on and hair is still wet and alot of CURLS.  So I take my fingers and play with the curls, take a towel and dry off some of the gel and I got a great hairdo all day long.  These caps are great.  Thank You Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;God Bless You.  Sincerely yours; Georgia  P.S. I think they may work WELL as Shower Caps too.</li>
    <li> I love them, great for multiple uses, then just replace.</li>
    <li> Really small, and super thin plastic--maybe good for one wearing on a child&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for these to arrive from Hong Kong.  Hotels don&#x27;t give out shower caps anymore, and I needed something to cover salad bowls and pies.  These did the trick.</li>
    <li> I wanted something like the shower caps you get in hotel bathrooms. This is not even close. It is much thinner and lower quality and it crinkles. It is clearly meant for one-time salon use. I didn&#x27;t mark it down for this, I just am pointing it out because I don&#x27;t think the product description really clarifies it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it&#x27;s intended purpose (single use), I would have said it was fine except that out of the four I&#x27;ve used so far, one was significantly smaller than the others. It wouldn&#x27;t cover my normal size head. I don&#x27;t know if it is mixing adult and child sizes in one package but I can&#x27;t imagine a stylist wanting to root around in their pile of caps for the size they want. Also, it comes in no-frills packaging; wadded together and tightly bound by a rubber band, which could tear the plastic shower caps if you aren&#x27;t careful removing it.</li>
    <li> not what  ex[ected but will work for what we need</li>
    <li> I use these shower caps for everything, taking a shower without redoing my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered A LOT of these -- probably more than I needed. But the price was too good to pass up. They are just like the kind you&#x27;d find at a hotel. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap, come on.</li>
    <li> value or money. it good to have when you have guest over or travelling. disposable quality.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand the previous reviews that said these were large.  I wonder if I received a different brand then they did.  These were so small that they wouldn&#x27;t go from my front hairline to my back hairline.  I have an average size head and a flat hair style so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s me.  I&#x27;d give zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> The elastic doesn&#x27;t go around the entire cap, so your hair gets wet in the shower. I&#x27;ll use them only for coloring hair.</li>
    <li> Probably a lot more than I needed in the package, but they are very convenient to have in each bathroom for guests as well as having them handy for myself.</li>
    <li> This product is unusable, will not fit over my head at all. It is absolutely useless and smells of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not order this!</li>
    <li> The usual plastic caps that can be purchased at any beauty supply store that usually cost $1.00 for 10 plastic caps.  I was placing other orders on Amazon and just added the plastic caps because it was 30 caps for $1.58.</li>
    <li> Not sure who these shower caps were made for, but they are ridiculously small.  Might work for a bald man with a very small head, but not for any woman with hair.</li>
    <li> The worst EVER!  They are too small and rip easily.  I didn&#x27;t think they were anything like the ones you get in hotels.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not at all good quality.  The caps are Not Large enough.  When you put the cap on, it rips.  Don&#x27; have time to return this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair but it&#x27;s fairly short, so these work OK for me. They&#x27;re like the kind of shower caps you&#x27;ll find at a Holiday Inn. They keep the water out, but if you have a lot of hair you may not be able to fit it all inside the cap. The package they come in describes them as caps to be used by salon staff on clients getting various beauty treatments. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re designed to be very roomy. So be warned.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as was described. The only issue was it didn&#x27;t arrive for 6 or 7 weeks, more than 4 weeks later than first promised, which is no surprise as I discovered when I found it had come from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have long hair (past shoulders, but not waist length) and we cannot fit all out hair in it.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t very durable or for people with long, thick hair!</li>
    <li> worth for  every penny.</li>
    <li> great for travel and conditioners</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have an abnormally large head and these were way too small to use to cover my hair.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a shower cap? These are thin but work fine for me when I want to leave conditioner on my hair for long periods of time</li>
    <li> very good price and worth your money</li>
    <li> they arrived little late.dont expect very high quality,but to the price they are more than worth,because we get just 5 for dollar in dollar store but here just for &amp;#60;$2 we are getting 30.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much what you would expect.  Cheap disposable shower caps.  No disappointment here.  I do reuse these and they&#x27;re very similar to what you would find in a hotel.</li>
    <li> I soak my hair in the shower for ultimate softness- these fit my head and hold all my hair withi plenty of room, but my hair is short.</li>
    <li> Does the job of a shower cap. Fits perfectly on a big head and the elastic does not get loose even after multiple uses.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here, poorly made and unless you are buying to use on a child&#x27;s head they&#x27;re too small.</li>
    <li> Too small and when you put them on they get rip. I was looking for hotel quality caps. So I could use then one week an then throw them away. This are a waste of money. Maybe they work for children.</li>
    <li> It came sooner than I expected. The shower caps are very thin so they break easily. And they don&#x27;t stretch at all so if you have a bigger head I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. But the price is worth it. Good for styling.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with great service. Perfect to use with a hair mask, or give your guest as I don&#x27;t like to share my shower cap with others. Not at all expensive so you can trash the used ones.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t even fit around your whole head</li>
    <li> Bought for deep conditioning my hair.  Bag is little big for my medium size head, but did the trick.  I also don&#x27;t have a lot of thick hair. So if you do, this bag will fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> These were not as big as another reviewer said they were, they squash my hair....they do not compare to the kind they have in hotels at all...I am very disappointed and not sure what to do with 30 of these things....not sure they are food safe to cover bowls as someone else mentioned either... they are made in China. I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I needed a shower cap large enough to cover my hair, yet not squash it down.  This is exactly what I wanted and the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is good quality at a very low price.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what you get in the hotel, and you can use a bunch of times and then throw it when the elastic dies. i recommend this as shower caps do not last a long time. money&#x27;s worth.</li>
