<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a cheaply made and ridiculously expensive item but it works really well. You might as well buy some big clips to hold the rollers in because they are NOT going to stay put, even using the technique described in the booklet. I have shoulder length silver hair with a little layering at the ends and I use 9 of the medium (purple) rollers.  Three on top, one on each side and four in the back. This means buying the starter set and the add on set. I love the bounce and smoothness I get from using these. I&#x27;m just hoping the handle doesn&#x27;t break the end caps don&#x27;t start falling off.    Since my original review I have gone to the Click n Curl website and ordered an additional handle in case the original breaks.</li>
    <li> Love this!  What a great idea, they work just like I hoped they would.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The one&#x27;s i got were too big and if you have very fine hair they don&#x27;t stay in all that well unless you have longer hair.</li>
    <li> The curlers kept falling out.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Brilliant!  My days of wandering around with brush handles sticking out all over my head, waiting for my hair to cool, are over!</li>
    <li> I like but I have a hard time getting them to stay in my hair and I have very thick hair.  Will keep working with them - may just take time to find the correct way.</li>
    <li> Wife Liked it.  et expectations</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. It helps give my hair body and style.</li>
    <li> These curlers are great and easy to use. The trick is that your hair needs to be at least a little damp and use the hand held dryer for styling.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect Christmas gift and was well appreciated and enjoyed!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have a hard time getting volume in my fine hair and these are amazing!  I even used them on my dry hair to give some extra life for a New Year&#x27;s party and my neighbor said, &amp;#34;WOW - your hair looks great!  Did you go get a blow out?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m going to buy another set so there are enough to do my entire head!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be satisfied with this product. Just what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
    <li> I Love these told my Daughter who is a Hair Stylist &amp; she agreed she said they use them at her Salon and she loves them too. I like the fullness and hold &amp; can put my make up on while they are setting. This is how I would use my Velcro rollers only now I Click and keep it moving. So easy. Genius Idea!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product!!! It is making my life a lot more easier!!! It is lad saving my hair from more damage!!!</li>
    <li> The ClickNCurl is easy to use and makes great curls.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Takes a little practice.  Leaves hair shiny and volumous!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Once you know how to work the brush into your hair.</li>
    <li> Do not work as advertised :(</li>
    <li> Click n Curl is flipping awesome! This product has made me enjoy styling my hair again. Not only do I truly appreciate and love my renewed look but I&#x27;m sure the people around me do as well. I bought the medium set my hair a couple inches past my shoulders and it works fine. Click n Curl is totally effortless and quick to use. No more hair clips!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I really wanted to like this.  It seems like a great idea.  I have medium length fine hair and the brushes just fall right out.  I think they&#x27;re just too heavy.  I returned the set.</li>
    <li> I tried my new set this morning.  It was so easy to get the fullness I don&#x27;t get from a curling iron.  The brushes stay in and it was quick to click the handle into the next brush.  I could dry AND curl rather than dry THEN curl.  I let them stay in until they were cool and went about getting ready for the day.  Definitely will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD CONCEPT . I USE THEM IN MY SALON</li>
    <li> These are ok. They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, but depending on how thick or thin or even just fine textured you&#x27;re hair is will greatly affect how these stay in. My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it and in some places they would stay and in other places not so much. I still think you get a better quality curl from a true hot roller or curling iron. It&#x27;s good for loose waves, but depending on what supporting hair products you&#x27;re using don&#x27;t expect it to last all day, especially if you have straight hair. I bought it because I had an Amazon gift card, not sure I would have if it was my own money.</li>
    <li> Awesome, worked as described and I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> Just love these!  I have a lot of fine hair and have always found it incredibly difficult to keep any type of curlers in my hair but these really work.  As long as I don&#x27;t try to roll too much hair on the roller, it truly stays in my hair and the beautiful volume I get is amazing and my hair just gorgeous.  I dry my hair about 3/4 of the way with my normal brush, then use one of these to run a few brush strokes through my hair and heat the barrel before &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; it and releasing to go on to the next section of hair.  I then spend a couple of minutes using the dryer to give a finishing shot of heat to all the curlers.  I then continuing getting ready for my day so the curlers can cool and set completely.  I remove them carefully, following the instructions to roll them UP and out.... fluff, arrange, spray and I have amazing hair.  I bought 2 full sets of the medium curlers for my &amp;#34;below shoulder length hair&amp;#34; and I am smiling from ear to ear!</li>
    <li> Love this rollers. My clients love them also</li>
    <li> genius!! genius!! i dreamed of a product like this and was thrilled to actually find it. better yet, it lived up to my expectations!</li>
    <li> Can use rollers without brush but good luck keeping in hair, especially if you have fine hair like mine.  Easy to use but cannot walk around house and allow to dry.  Plus who only gives 6 rollers for a whole head of hair. I bought the 4 extra , BUT have since decided I could have just used 5, and the last one to go around bottom of hairline with just one roller and blow those areas dry very quickly.</li>
    <li> The brush, using as just a round brush isn&#x27;t bad, but...they DO NOT stay in the hair.  My hair is not short, but...not long either but still, they do not stay in my hair at all. Bought two sizes and even the smaller ones do not stay in. Great idea, and would probably work on LONG hair great.</li>
    <li> I just used my set this morning. I really like it- I need some help with the hair by my face but I will just keep practicing. You know what is missing? A bag to store all the pieces!! Do you think you will come up with one? The box is small but bulky and won&#x27;t last long. Thanks!</li>
    <li> A great idea. I do love using these. They add nice volume. They don&#x27;t always stay in on the front of my head but other then that, they are great .</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have 4 kids under the age of 5 and this product saves me loads of time.  Plus it makes it look like I tried to put myself together.  Love, love , love these!!</li>
    <li> Worked very well.  I was disappointed that the medium was as large as it is.  I will probably order the small size to use with it.</li>
    <li> Love these things!  I have very very fine shoulder length hair, and the mediums are perfect for me.  They are so light weight that they stay in just fine, yet easily come out when I&#x27;m ready to take them out.  I don&#x27;t like to take the time to use a curling iron, and there was only so much curl I could get from drying my hair while using a round brush....but now I get the affect of having used hot curlers without adding a single minute to my morning routine!  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my hair every single day since I started using then last week!  My only complaint would be that I&#x27;ll need to get a bag or pouch of some sort to easily store and carry them, as now they are loose in my cabinet, which I don&#x27;t like.  It would be nice if the manufacturers included a carry case of some sort.  But that&#x27;s my only issue-- they work like a dream!!</li>
    <li> The set is ok although they do not hold as well as I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thought they would save me time but they don&#x27;t.  Might be better to use when you have estra time to&lt;br /&gt;work with.</li>
    <li> Love them brilliant item, even on short hair!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the click n curl in December, 2014 and have used it several times. It&#x27;s a great idea. I use several brushes that have a similar barrel and leave them in my hair. So I thought this product, removing the handle, would be better. They are NOT for fine hair. Falls out if I make any movement. Sometimes I don&#x27;t need to move and they fall out. I have shoulder length hair so the size is not too large. As I said I have the similar type round brush with fixed handles, same size and larger one. The quality of my regular brushes are much better and have more bristles. They stay in my hair till i remove them.  It&#x27;s too late for me to return the product so I&#x27;m tossing them in the trash.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  My hair is a little past shoulder-length and very full.  I was concerned if &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; would be the right size and if just 6 rollers would do the job.  Well, they definitely do!  I dry my hair almost completely, then roll the curls.  I go back and hit them a couple of times with the hairdryer on high-heat, medium power and leave the curlers in for about 5 minutes.  I get nice loose curls with lots of body that last all day.</li>
    <li> These give great volume just make sure to use them as instructed, roll hair under othewise they are harder to get out of your hair.  They get easier to use with practice.</li>
    <li> This is just pure genius!  I have very thin hair and this has added so much volume to my hair that lasts even after sleeping on it!  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I&#x27;m still glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this product. I saw one of the stylists at my salon using something like this, and I had to have it. No more trying to juggle 2-3 round brushes at a time during styling. I have shoulder-length, fine hair. The medium size works great for me; however, 6 rollers isn&#x27;t enough. I bought add-on set for an addition 4 curlers and it still isn&#x27;t enough! Ideally for my hair I would need 12 rollers. In hindsight, I should have just bought 2 complete sets. It&#x27;s cheaply made and chances are the brush stick will break over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it wasn&#x27;t included with the set,I also bought some jaw clips to hold the curlers in place. This is definitely needed for my fine hair. I purchased the Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count. There is a big disparity in pricing of these things. You may find cheaper if you look around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1) Great hair body after use. 2) Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) Not enough rollers (you need at least 12 for fine hair; thus doubling the actual cost of the product). 2) Cheaply made (the end caps are already falling off &amp; the entire set isn&#x27;t very sturdy. I doubt these will last more than 1-2 years. 3) Nothing included to hold curlers in place. I suppose some hair types wouldn&#x27;t need anything to hold the curlers, but you definitely need jaw clips if you have fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d shop for a better quality product that included enough rollers to set my entire head of hair &amp; included claw clips to hold the curlers in place. However, the product actually works great so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars just for that.</li>
    <li> I am not good with my hair, but these give me volume and so easy to use.  I like using them when I really want my hair to look good. It  takes a bit more time but worth it!</li>
    <li> I frequently look for new ways to curl my hair and following several failure purchases in the past few years, I was delighted to be thrilled with these!!!!  My hair is heavy and straight, it&#x27;s difficult to add volume and curl rarely stays long, even with a LOT of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These gave me light, fun, bouncy curls!!  As well as, a good deal of volume!  I used very little hair spray, trying the first time while hanging out at home, and to my surprise, I still had fantastic curl at the end of the day.  I am so happy with these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times to use rollers as instructed, with little success. My hair won&#x27;t hold rollers in place very well. I&#x27;ve waited a couple weeks too long, now I&#x27;m not able to return.</li>
    <li> this is a horrible product.  The brush is not very strong, so the bristles do not stay.  They fall right out.  Completely horrible product.</li>
    <li> I just did not  think this product was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. I have fine hair and they help lift the hair. May be getting more! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> You can get the clips for these at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.  You will get 10 of them for $5.49.  I have not gotten or used this product yet I was checking it all out before I decided to get or not.  And checking out prices of everything needed for it to be used.  I do like the idea of it. I have fine straight hair to my shoulders slightly curled under, all one length.  If I get it will be the large rollers.</li>
    <li> Rollers easy to use.leave them in. If not in a hurry or heat with hair dryer for fast results.</li>
    <li> now i have to return these...why didn&#x27;t I read the reviews! I saw that it was 4 stars and just purchased. Great concept but the rollers don&#x27;t stay in your hair. So frustrating but am so grateful for the people who take time to write the reviews. I just need to read them and I will do that in the future!</li>
    <li> expensive but worked good, only used once because it was very late to be delivered, arrived several days late on 3/4/15 a.m.</li>
    <li> OMG...so easy to use!!  I love these. I have a girl come to my house once a week to blow out my hair, and I use these in between her blowouts!!  Great product and would def recommend purchasing!!</li>
    <li> These got stuck in my hair!</li>
    <li> If I have any criticism at all it is that for my thick course hair it worked too well!!!!</li>
    <li> I used these curlers for the 2nd time today, and they RIPPED OUT an entire section of my hair.  My head is still throbbing, and the curler became stuck in my hair.  This is a horrible product, and I immediately threw them away.  I have never had broken hair like this in my life.</li>
    <li> I love the concept of these &amp; it may just be my lack of skill.  I&#x27;ve only tried them twice, &amp; it didn&#x27;t go well, but I am commited to keep trying to make them work.</li>
    <li> Does NOT come with 4 additional brush heads as described at the top. Is only the regular set. My wife likes the brush set, but was disappointed to not receive the 4 additional brush heads that were listed as included (not in the body, but up at the top of the page).</li>
    <li> Immediately returned.  The curlers didn&#x27;t stay on the handle well and the curlers didn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I will start with this is a really great product. It definitely works and makes styling so much easier than curling, or blow&lt;br /&gt;Drying! I had no problems using it. The drawbacks: it is a little flimsy and the bristles are cheap. If you have thick or very long hair you may find using these a little difficult. It would be better if they changed the bristles to a combination of&lt;br /&gt;Plastic and boar. For what you get a price of $29.99 would be more appropriate. But as I said it did work and I was happy with the style results.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me - the brushy rollers fell right out, even after I wiggled them, as the included extra instructions said to do. I have medium-length thick hair, enough to wrap around each medium-sized roller and then some, and I was sure this would work for me. I love the concept and really tried hard to make it work. Reluctantly sending it back for a refund. For the price, I want rollers that will work without a lot of extra effort.</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
    <li> I like the concept of this product and was excited to try it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a bust. The curlers don&#x27;t hold well in my hair and the result isn&#x27;t anything better than I already get with velcro rollers (at a fraction of the price). Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this after seeing the video on &amp;#34;Joyus.com&amp;#34; It looked so easy! NOT SO. Rollers do not stay in your hair, and they left my hair very frizzy. Not the smooth/sleek blow out as promised.</li>
    <li> This is a good styling tool once you get used to it.You must order the clips as well, otherwise the brushes just fall out. I have very fine hair and they did add body to it. You need to work with the brushes and see where they need to be placed for your haircut. I have a bob and it did give my hair added body.</li>
    <li> I love this product and always pack it when I travel; no more hot styling products put into my overnight bag.  It took me a few times to figure out exactly the placement/roll pattern for my hair and I have to make sure to do the &amp;#34;wiggle&amp;#34; back and forth so they hold in my finer hair.  I just  added the add on set of the Smaller size to intermix.</li>
    <li> Takes a little bit to get used to how to style but great results once you figure it out.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift and got myself a set as well.  Get your hair mostly dry, put your hair up in these light-weight rollers and finish getting ready.  Take them down and you&#x27;ll have a little lift and they smooth as well.</li>
    <li> I laughed when I saw this product because 2 years ago, I told me husband I was going to invent a brush with detachable heads so that I could leave them in my hair while drying to achieve volume instead of putting 7 brushes in my hair like medusa.  I ordered this set with high hopes, but it sadly did not work for me.  The bristles on the brush are way too short and do not grab the hair taught enough.  This means your hair will tangle.  The times that it did work, when I pulled them out, my hair had frizzy ends because of this.  They also do need a place for your finger to fit in order to remove them because now, you just unroll them while touching the surface of the hair which creates tangles/frizz as well.  I will continue to search for a better model, or maybe just invent one myself :)</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing curling device ever!  I have course longer hair and this smooths and curls perfectly.  I have had many hair gadgets but this is the best.  In fact, II am ordering another set to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> I am admittedly am a bit of a hair tool/product junkie. When I pulled the rigger on this,  I had a tempered expectation because I have never been able to master the round brush blow out. But,  literally the first time I used this set, it was amazing!  I didn&#x27;t even use the brush to blow dry my hair.  I set my barely-dry, air-dried hair in the rollers, blasted each with some heat with the hair dryer, left them in for 5-10 min. while I put on my make-up and pulled them out. I got smooth, voluminous waves that looked and felt like I just got a blow-out.  I also received several compliments on my hair at work, several hours later.  Love this kit. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get the look of a fresh blow-out with minimal time and effort.</li>
    <li> I tried several times to get the hang of this product.  I just couldn&#x27;t.  Even after spending more time that I usually do with my hair.  I finally threw in the towel with this product when I spent 2x the time with inferior results twice than if I just used a single round brush and blow dried in sections.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use, a great idea!! Instead of having to use several brushes like I used to , I use these and love them!!! Just put them in, the blow dryer heats them up , leave them in, finish blow drying and you have a  wave or curl!!  The price is great also and they arrived in a timely manner and were packaged securely.</li>
    <li> Speeding delivery.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> OK...so I will just start by saying that on a daily basis, I will use Sporette natural brushes which I will leave in my hair and then proceed to walk about the house with about 10 brushes in my hair.  While this is entertaining for my husband and does result in the BEST hair ever...This is a much better solution.  In fact, for years, I would think...wouldn&#x27;t it be great if the brush and the handle were separate.  Suffice to say, this is that solution.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t keep the rollers to stay in. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but the Click n Curl is pretty cool. It&#x27;s so easy to use and works great. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I&#x27;ve already had compliments on my hair. It makes my hair look much more polished. I don&#x27;t have time in the morning to dry my hair and then curl it or straighten it, so this is a great time-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the small rollers (my hair is chin length), which do create some curl. I&#x27;ll probably get the medium rollers too so I can have some variety especially if I grow my hair out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to give myself a nice looking blow out.  My arms get tired before my hair is dry and my fine hair just ends up looking lifeless an hour later.  Click n Curl has finally made my life easier!!  Works just as advertised.  You definitely want to watch the videos for tips, but once you get it, it&#x27;s easy.  It does take some time.  I do my hair first and leave the barrels in my hair while I do my makeup and get ready.  If you have a lot of hair, you should probably get the add on set of barrels.  This set has worked fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have never had a product that I could use when drying my hair that takes the place of a curling iron until I found this product. I still use the iron for tighter curls at times, but most days it is dry and go with this. Oh, to have had this when my mornings were rushed. It would have made a huge difference. If that&#x27;s the case with you buy it now, especially if you have thin, short to shoulder length hair. AWESOME product!</li>
    <li> When I saw this product featured on the Today Show as the &#x27;find of the year&#x27; in June 2013 I knew I needed to have it.  I have long, thick hair.  I love being able to blow my hair dry and curl it in a shorter time.  Also, the curl from the brushes seems to hold much longer than a curling iron.  I love the look.  Everyone needs this product!</li>
    <li> Love them gives lots of volume. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Harder to use than it looks.  I think if I was a professional hairdresser it would have been easier.  I watched the video online and did everything they said to do but my hair didn&#x27;t turn out as good as it does when I do my own blow out.  I will try it again just to see if practice makes perfect.  I am hoping for a better result...</li>
    <li> Works well, came on time, just what I wanted.  These really give me a lot of volume and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the Click n Curl product. It is easy to use and provides a lot of body with out a lot of work.  I dropped one of the brushes connected to the handle the first day and the end popped off, but I just glued it back on and I have not had any problems since.  Some of these detachable handle brushes came with clips.  It would have been nice if this one did as well, Some times the brush does not stay in and the clips would have helped that.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great idea. Easy and fun to use. Makes beautiful soft curls and your arms don&#x27;t wear out!</li>
    <li> These curlers do not stay in my hair without clips holding them. They do not give my hair enough body so I still curl my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best invention ever!!! I love my click n curl curlers!!  for the longest time I had been hoping someone would invent something like this and they must have heard my prayers!  I totally recommend them, they are better then hot curlers because you don&#x27;t have to dry your hair completely like when you use hot curlers and you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.  Just wrap the click n curl curler and set the dryer on it for a few seconds and viola!!! I love the volume they give my hair too!!! I have the medium sets and the small sets....  I love them both the same!!!</li>
    <li> Not much better than using a round brush.  Much too expensive for what it is. Brush handle is made VERY cheaply.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own these, but am thinking of buying them.  If you watch the YouTube videos, you&#x27;ll see that the medium and large ones only smooth the hair and give no curl whatsoever.  As well, it appears that the company is including the bristles in the measurement of the curler.  For example the 2&amp;#34; curler really looks like it&#x27;s 1.5 inches.  Can anyone corroborate that?</li>
    <li> This brush set has traveled with me everywhere. I can leave everything behind but not my brush set. It is super awesome. I do my hair and it looks like I went to the hair salon.</li>
    <li> returned this item.  Curlers were too big and the description on the site did not represent what was actually shipped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, It&#x27;s nice that it clicks right on but I had trouble keeping the brushes on my hair</li>
    <li> I have trouble getting these to stay in my hair. When they do i like the effect.</li>
    <li> I guess they work good. My wife ordered them on my account. Her hair looks ok. I guess I better ask her what she is doing different with her hair. This could work well for me! Update: This is the wife. Yes, they are great! Actually learned about these from my salon where they used them on my hair. Loved them so much I ordered a set of my own. As for husband....*smh*.</li>
    <li> I want to love this product, but after two weeks of fiddling with it, I am disappointed.  It does produce volume, but I find it roughs up my hairs cuticle a lot.  It results in kinks and frizz and I have easy straight hair.  I didn&#x27;t give it lower stars because it does give volume and a nice curl to the end when you get it right.  Also, I find it poorly executed.  I have thin hair and I find the &amp;#34;rollers&amp;#34; just fall out, they don&#x27;t stick like Velcro rollers.  I wish they have left the middle of the barrel open and I could use clips to hold them on.  Forget rolling my in a backwards motion, they automatically fall out.  I can only use them rolled under.</li>
    <li> I just love these!  Really easy to use.  Takes minimal time. I have chin length hair and the medium size is perfect.  Hair comes out really shiny and full of body.  I&#x27;ve received SO many compliments - people have told me I look like I just left the salon. What could be better than that!</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and hair does not stay rolled up.</li>
    <li> I like the idea, the problem is that there&#x27;s no way to keep the rollers in place once you unclip the handle. They have some weight to them so they unroll. They&#x27;re too big to be held on with a clip so they just fall out...which defeats the purpose!</li>
    <li> These are pretty neat. I definitely need to practice more. When I go to my stylist, she uses these on my hair with great success. I still need to finish with a curling item after I use them, but I think I just need more practice.&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length, fine hair and they work pretty well. Follow the instructions and they stay in place until you take them out.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Exactly as advertised.  Happy with product</li>
    <li> works better on wet hair, otherwise the ends get a bit frizzy.  Have trouble with hold arm up because of numbness, so this works instead of using my regular bush.  Just wish the roller part has Boar bristles too for the shine.  Maybe they will improve them down the road.  At least I can style my hair and not have my entire arm go numb before I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> These are a great gift for the teenagers in your family and are easy to use</li>
    <li> This is my second set.... I Love them.  Great idea and very well made.</li>
    <li> Curlers are too large and bulky.  Handle attaches and detaches easily, but the product is difficult for me to use.</li>
    <li> Great way to give body to your hair,</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay put in your hair even after watching the video many times over and doing exactly how they did it, didn&#x27;t hold a curl at all.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get them to stay in my hair.  I do like the brush, as it is a very good round brush and air circulates and dries hair faster.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE these! So glad someone invented them.</li>
    <li> i am a license beautician, and has been in the salon industry for 5 years now. Click  N Curl is for someone who did not take the time to research the poor quality materials, you know like ME. I was mislead. Definitely not for Professional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would NEVER recommend this product to a professional stylist. Here&#x27;s my experience, i had this Click n Curl for 3 months, I tried it  on my first client with fine hair, keep i mind i work at a professional salon so i use product lines for fine hair. By the time my clien walked out her hair was FLAT!!!!!!!!! I tried it with medium, and coarse hair, same results, differnt ethnicity, same results. I always end up having to use my original boar brushes, or paul mitchells round brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Experience 2, so i thought that I must had a defective batch, which is hard to believe that all 18 round brushes differnt sizes were a defective.My salon had a new technique Round brushing blow dry class of 15 stylist. I refuse to use Click N Curl. I used my others.&lt;br /&gt;Our blow dry instructor has been a stylist for 20 years and she travesl teaching blow dry classes, so yes we paid her to teach us techniques. I&#x27;ve notice 3 other stylist were using their click and curl , they had the hardest time getting volume in their blowouts. And yes our blow outs were on live models. So the instructor walks over to the one with click and curl and started blowdrying, no results.. started it again this time with a little more heat, NO RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;She walkeed to the other one with Click N Curl, same scenario NO RESULTS. A few seconds of quick fix, Then its all flat!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> Since my hairdresser likes to leave several brushes in my hair when blowdrying it, I thought this would be a great home solution.  It was a disaster!  You have to brush enough with each head to heat it up, the unclip the handle while it is wound up in your hair like a roller.  However, it does not stay like a roller in my hair.  Each head is too big, long and heavy, and they are very awkward to try to leave in, then they just fall out.  I really wanted to like this, but not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Takes some practice, but does add a lot of body to your hair. The size is larger than they look.</li>
    <li> Great for travel....styling brush and hot rollers in one!</li>
    <li> None of these rollers stayed- while trying to add a second roller the first one fell out! Not at all what I expected which is why Ibreturned it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had theses in my wish list for a while. They are pricey but they work. The click in handle is sturdy and the curlers are well made. I have a chin length bob and the mediums are perfect.  I hang my head down and blow dry until my hair is almost completely dry and then I put these in. It has been a real time saver.  I live in a Florida and it is nice to leave them in while I get ready to keep cool and avoid that melting feeling we have down here when getting ready.  I&#x27;ve noticed when I use a silicone based styling product that the curlers slip a bit. I just use the clips from my hot rollers to secure the curlers on those days. Recommend!</li>
    <li> The curlers were easy to use, but I had to use clips to keep them in.  I have straight hair and I guess my hair really needs more heat to curl.  They added nice body but it didn&#x27;t last very long.  Hot rollers work much better for me.</li>
    <li> These are great but don&#x27;t expect a lot of curl unless you get the smaller ones.  People complained about their hair getting tangled and I had no problem with that and have long fine hair but a fair amount of it.  It is a great quick way to keep out the frizz if you are in a hurry to get somewhere and needed to wash your hair on the spur of a moment.  You will have good body in your hair as well.  Very worth the purchase for emergency situations.  Neat invention of the handle release......Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in long enough.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  Did not deliver as promoted.  I would not recommend this product.  The curlers would not stay in my hair well.  Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Came right on time! They save a hairstylist a ton of time! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!! I will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> What a great idea !!! I gave it only three stars because my hair gets a little frizzy from the quality of the rollers so I have to smooth out after I remove them. I also have to use hair clips to hold them in once I set, otherwise they&#x27;ll fall out :)</li>
    <li> This is the best curling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It accomplishes multiple looks with just the one curling system.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products that I have used for my hair in a long time.  I had absolutely no problems with the curlers staying in my hair and it is very easy to use.  I also find that it takes less time for my hair to dry.  This makes my hair full with just the right amount of curl,  I love this product!</li>
    <li> After they were rolled and set they hurt and picked my head.  Returned them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews here.  These are super easy to use and give long lasting curl/body.  I have absolutely no skills when it comes to styling my hair and can&#x27;t believe how quick and easy these are.</li>
    <li> We reorder this item because my wife loved it so much and wanted another set, but the rollers we got the second time were used and had hairs in them.&lt;br /&gt;The boxed looked tampered and looked like it was a previous return where the the person tried to clean it before send it back&lt;br /&gt;but she didn&#x27;t do a good job, actually a horrible job.&lt;br /&gt;Who sells used or returned hair care products like this?&lt;br /&gt;This is like selling used combs, or toothbrushes .&lt;br /&gt;This was not only DISGUSTING  but NON_HYGIENIC as well.&lt;br /&gt;If this was a mistake by one of their employees, needs to be corrected and he or she&lt;br /&gt;needs to be properly trained to avoid this type of mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;Errors like this might be a health hazard.&lt;br /&gt;If in fact is lawful to do this, please clean them accordingly to health code and standards, and disclose the unit&lt;br /&gt;is or might be refurbished or allow the customer to chose the item condition.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed.</li>
    <li> They work ok...but found the medium too large to hold my medium length hair....wouldn&#x27;t stay in...</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this.  It made my hair look like the stylist blowout I was looking for.  I thought about buying the add on curlers, but I only need 1 more so I will just use the brush.  I did have to use large clips to hold them in place, but not an issue</li>
    <li> I like these a lot  It&#x27;s easier to use if someone else is doing your hair.  My hair is pretty long for an old lady, blow dry hair til almost dry then roll them up and heat up the brush curls with the hair dryer, leave in until cooled down and vavoom you have bouncy hair.  Wish I had the patience to use this every time I did my hair.  I used twice and it looks good in my drawer.</li>
    <li> They were described as medium BUT were far too large..I have  shoulder length hair and they were too huge.Showed friends who all thought they were &amp;#34; large&amp;#34; Feel I wasted my money, a shame as they would have been helpful</li>
    <li> Certainly easier than curlers and works well. My hair is medium length and this is what I use now instead of the curlers. Really like them, although my longish bangs are too short to hold the curler, so you really need hair long enough to go around the whole curler.</li>
    <li> They are ok.  Need various sizes I guess for better styling. These come in medium, and my hair just looks weird when I take the rollers out.</li>
    <li> Love these. Be sure to buy clips to hold them in but they make your hair look amazing. Easy to travel with too</li>
</ol>
