<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells fantastic! Makes my hair feel great &amp; it&#x27;s not heavy!  Doesn&#x27;t leave a white powder behind! Definitely will buy again! I love it!!</li>
    <li> First time user. Works ok, but not as good as some other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. My favorite value brand dry shampoo is Suave - works great!!</li>
    <li> works great...no need to shampoo every day</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Less residue than other products.</li>
    <li> Once the can is shaken up well, this dry shampoo is white like all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. When I first tried it, I hadn&#x27;t shaken the can up and, miraculously, there was no white residue.  However, I learned from a hair forum that I simply was not using it right.  Shaking the can up produced the dreaded white stuff.  Now I&#x27;m sorry now that I bought two cans of this stuff.  I was hoping for a translucent formula but this one just makes my dark blond hair look ashy and gray like all the rest.  And the can doesn&#x27;t even contain much product at all.  Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s not as good as Batiste, which is my usual brand.  If you&#x27;re thinking that this can save you from a shampoo, think again.  They&#x27;ll be so much evidence you used a dry shampoo that you will be shamed into washing your hair before you leave the house!  I sprayed this on and waited 10 minutes, but nothing happened.  The residue didn&#x27;t disappear and brushing it out didn&#x27;t work either.  So I wore my hair in an updo and couldn&#x27;t wait until I could wash the stuff outta my strands!  Yes, if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap dry shampoo, this one&#x27;s passable.  As for me, my hunt resumes for a formula with no white chalky residue.  I know it&#x27;s out there...somewhere.  I just need to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo out there. I&#x27;ve tried everything else. Others tend to leave the hair sticky or flat. this one gives you the clean and fluffy feeling.</li>
    <li> Leaves visibly white powder in darker hair.</li>
    <li> Yes, it smells great. Yes, it gives you amazing volume. But the one &amp; most important job it has is to rid of the greasy appearance of hair &amp; its oils &amp; honestly, it does not. As others people have mentioned, this attempt of dry shampoo leaves a white powdery residue that not even brushing helps it go away. Maybe if you have light or blonde hair is not as noticeable, but I have an ombre &amp; it just does not do the job. IF you are looking for an actual all over amazing dry shampoo &amp; do not want to spend more $ than necessary, i recommend the SUAVE KERATIN INFUSED DRY SHAMPOO. It&#x27;s a gold tall bottle, which is literally worth gold! It works magic with my hair not only leaving it feeling soft &amp; voluminous, but oil/greasy free &amp; NO WHITE RESIDUE. Check out its reviews &amp; you will all see, it is a way better alternative than yhis ok product.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Smells great and allows me to quickly make my hair look good without having to wash it every day. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Pretty good dry shampoo for a drug store brand. I am a huge fan of Bumble &amp; Bumble’s, but it’s so pricey that this is a good one for the gym bag or non special occasion use.</li>
    <li> Amazing product--cleans up hair in a pinch, when there isn&#x27;t hot water for a shower.</li>
    <li> I HAVE THIS ON AUTO RE-SHIP - WORKS GREAT &amp; SMELLS EVEN BETTER</li>
    <li> Light and fresh - the product smells great in my hair.  I like to apply it before bed if I know I won&#x27;t be washing my hair in the morning.  I also spray a little more around my bangs and face when I wake up to give my hair a little more volume.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how nice it smells, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brown hair, and I definitely recommend spraying hair from at least 6 inches away.  It comes out as a white powder, so be sure to brush/ fluff your hair to get rid of it!</li>
    <li> Smells great and eliminates greasy feel. No white on my hair and helps volumize it a little bit</li>
    <li> Normally, I love the Garnier Frustis products but this dry shampoo only made my hair look dirtier...</li>
    <li> Works great, and smells better than most dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used many dry shampoo but I love this one the most. The smell is amazing and the bottle is well designed. You should give it a try if you are reading right now</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo. I have fine thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t get very oily but this product is a great pick-me-up for day 2 on my hair. I can&#x27;t find it at my local stores anymore. I love the smell and compared to Suave it takes the cake.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  Makes my hair too weighed down and doesn&#x27;t get out the greasy look.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a great spray nozzle so I feel like I have to use half of the bottle to get the normal dry shampoo feel.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and I can t find it anywhere but here.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me left my hair greasy . Really disappointed.  But shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I used to have to wash my hair every day.  With the dry shampoo I can go two days between wet washings</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work as well as others.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, this product is great for giving your hair that bounce, shine, and just washed smell. You don&#x27;t have to use as much as you think. Just try to spray at the roots, which will make the can last longer.</li>
    <li> Humph.  Not impressed.  No extra body.  No clean feeling.  Not excited about the scent.  It just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;do it&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair. I&#x27;ve used other products in the past that leave a powder residue which obviously doesn&#x27;t look too nice. This stuff just takes all the oil away and leaves my blonde hair full of body.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped it would.  It didn&#x27;t seem to remove the oil in my hair like it should.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes hair look clean and shiny PLUS adds body and lift.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for me. I have tried some of the higher end dry shampoos and none seem to do the trick for me. After spraying this one on my roots it leaves them feeling and looking less oily and does not feel heavy on the hair at all.</li>
    <li> Works great! Allows me to skip a day and not have to shampoo each and every day.</li>
    <li> I used this in the hospital after I had our son. Great smell and really freshened my hair up since I was too weak to really wash it. Great for in between washes to freshen up.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Seems a little chalky but I have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t. I will continue to purchase this because for the money it really is one of the better dry shampoo on the market in my opinion and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> Love this light dry shampoo doesnt weigh my hair done or add volume or texture like sticky hairspray types of dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried before.I have thick hair so I dont like to use anything with too much volume so this is great</li>
    <li> Great product, just not much in the can</li>
    <li> Great smelling, nice boost of volume.</li>
    <li> Refreshes my hair and scalp in between washings.  Excellent product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo ever and very well priced! I have tried a lot as I have hair that I can&#x27;t wash every day but also gets a little greasy sometimes.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Some dry shampoos have a hairspray smell, this one is fresh citrus.</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo.  I actually like how my hair behaves a day or two after washing and with dry shampoo I can skip a washing here and there and not have greasy looking hair.  I was paying $18 a bottle for another brand which worked a bit better than the Fructis, but for my money Fructis still does a great job.</li>
    <li> This was used by someone with dark thick hair looking for hair to smell good after heavy working out and sweating, not to remove too much oil.  Yes this product works for dark hair if you shake well and spray 10-12&amp;#34; from head it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.  Actually tried several brands from this to very expensive and this worked great.  The more expensive brands do remove more oil but they also have a strong chemical smell and leave a white residue.  Also, if you have thick hair that you have to straighten the more expensive brands made the hair thicker.  This didn&#x27;t add lots of body which isn&#x27;t really what you want with thick hair.  Now, after purchasing this item I continued looking only because you have to use a good amount and the good scent goes away after a little while.  Still an awesome product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then found Got2b Oil-licious Dry Oil Hair Taming Mist which is like a dry conditioner.  This product is the best ever so I actually no longer use the Garnier because the Got2b product makes your hair smell awesome for a long time and doesn&#x27;t add too much shine.  I think it&#x27;s one of the best products out there, at least for thick hair since it doesn&#x27;t add body or remove oil from your hair. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t add too much shine like other shine sprays but does make your hair look healthy and moisturized.  Also makes your hair look fantastic while smelling like you just washed it.  It does eliminate the burn smell if you flat iron your hair and your hair looks great even if you flat iron after using the product.</li>
    <li> I use dry shampoos fairly regularly since I have fine hair that gets greasy. Washing my hair everyday makes it a lot drier than it needs to be (since I also color my hair) so if I don&#x27;t wash it or dry shampoo it every day it looks pretty slick and flat. I found this dry shampoo to be too potent in its citrusy sweet smell and many times my hair would come out looking sort of whitish-gray. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever! It&#x27;s light, smells good, and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I use dry shampoo sometimes after a workout.. This didnt work for me. Dosent leave my hair with a nice clean and dry feeling (or look) after use. Not buying again</li>
    <li> I have short dark hair and this works just fine for me. I never had to use anything when I had long hair, but a month ago I decided to go for a lob. I love it, but it&#x27;s not as wash- and- go as long hair and there&#x27;s more upkeep as well. This product does the trick, though. And so inexpensively! Like I said, my hair is dark and I&#x27;ve never had trouble with white residue. Maybe because it&#x27;s short?</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with dry shampoo so I don&#x27;t have anything compare it to.  But I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair feel any less greasy and it also makes my hair look gray, almost as if I sprayed it with gray hair dye.  I live in a rural community and don&#x27;t have access to stores that sell this type of product, thats why I purchased it from Amazon.  I will not purchase this product again and I would not recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have fine limp hair and I did like the body it gave me. However, my hair is also dark brown, and like the other reviewers stated, if you have dark hair it is going to give it a dull, gray tint and that&#x27;s not exactly a good look.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but only use once between washings so you don&#x27;t overdry your hair or make it sticky (the same can be said for other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
    <li> I use this dry shampoo every other day between shampoos, and it works really well. I have very sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair: naturally mousey brown but I highlight the majority of it with warm and light blondes. It is fine, but fairly thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping my hair clean and voluminous is very important to me. I like to use dry shampoo on my hair even right after I wash and blow dry it for extra volume. I&#x27;ve tried Dove, Suave, Batiste, and Psst dry shampoos. The Suave dry shampoos are my favorite (both Keratin and standard-check out my reviews on those products as well), but this one deserves 4 stars as a runner-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good. The scent is consistent with other Garnier hair products, but I can&#x27;t pinpoint a specific fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for fine hair if you want some volume. If you use this product generously, you&#x27;ll see some nice volume that stays throughout the day without having to backcomb your hair or add hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price. Prices for dry shampoos are all over the place. This one is a good price and the product does work. No need to spent $10+ when a product like this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for brunettes. Plain and simple. I have blonde hair but can still see a bit of white powdery residue when I use it. Requires quite a bit of &amp;#34;working in&amp;#34; before the whiteness goes away. I&#x27;m certain that on brunettes it would be visible or at least it would really dull the hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle runs out fast. Yes, I use more than others may use, but it runs out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best if you&#x27;re using it for a clean hair look on a &amp;#34;no wash&amp;#34; day. It doesn&#x27;t do the best job at absorbing your hair&#x27;s oils. It does an okay job, but I think if someone has actual oily hair, it wouldn&#x27;t give you the best result. I&#x27;ve found its best for volumizing and doing minor oil cleanup..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is scented, and it is fairly strong. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this is not the product for you.f</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  It&#x27;s the only one that has worked for me.  When I sprayed it on, I didn&#x27;t see any white powder at all.  My hair stayed clean all day, a first for me because I&#x27;m one of those who has to wash their hair every day or it gets really oily.  I have very fine hair and there did seem to be more volume.  I was amazed.  The other powdery ones I&#x27;ve used usually just made my oily hair white and clumped together, never felt clean.  This was truly different.  I&#x27;m going to use this for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have only tried this once, but it did not work on my &amp;#34;off shampoo&amp;#34; day.  It did not help with flat, lifeless hair.</li>
    <li> Meh - not thrilled .  The scent was really nice but it did a very poor job of absorbing oil on my oily head  as compared to other dry shampoo products that are same price or cheaper such as suave or batiste .</li>
    <li> Great quality product! I&#x27;d recommend it for a second or third Good Hair Day :)</li>
    <li> Didnt really work, I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> This was not an effective product for my hair.  It literally did nothing.  I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t apply enough so I sprayed some more and the only noticeable difference was the white powder visible in my hair.  It didn&#x27;t soak up the oil or add body.  I tried the product more than once.  I would think I was spraying an empty can of air had I not been choking/coughing on the residue.</li>
    <li> AS a dry shampoo it works pretty well, probably in the top 20% of the 8+ brands I&#x27;ve tried, but the smell is so horrid I had to give it only 2 stars.  I noticed other reviewers say they like the smell and at least one said &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it smells like,&amp;#34; well, let me tell you, it smells like a bowl of very sweet, very ripe fruit.  So if you want your head to smell like fruit, then go for it.  Personally, I wish it smelled a little more like fresh, clean soap.  Too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have not found a single dry shampoo that works well that also smells great, so I don&#x27;t have another product to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found there are 2 categories of dry shampoo: 1) the traditional &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; type that (if done well) looks like you&#x27;ve scattered your head with talc, but (if done well) the white brushes out easily with a good boar bristle brush and the hair is left less oily (less dirty) and with lots of texture and body. The white stuff (if done right) is actually a finely milled clay that absorbs hair oil.  2) the newer type &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; products that are really a lot more like sticky hairspray.  Personally, this second category of &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; sprays has not proven to work on my fine, straight, limp hair at all.  On the 2nd or 3rd day going without a shampoo, my hair oil really starts to build up and these types of dry shampoos do not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this one is at the top of my list.  It does a good job of absorbing oil and leaves my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;With some dry shampoos, I&#x27;ve found the powdery-residue to be somewhat sticky and difficult to brush out. This one has a finer powder and is much easier to brush through my hair. As long as I don&#x27;t spray too much, it does not leave that ugly white residue behind like so many other dry shampoos. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m walking around with a head full of powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this dry shampoo is divine. It initially smells like watermelon, but that dissipates quickly and leaves my hair smelling clean and fresh for the rest of the day. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and this definitely adds volume just too much for me.</li>
    <li> I normally use TIGI rockahollic dirty secret but I thought I&#x27;d try something new.  TIGI is still my favorite.  My husband gets irritated when I spray this as the smell is strong.  Not as bad as most dry shampoos but not the greatest.  Ignoring the smell it works really well</li>
    <li> Nice fruity smelling dry shampoo.  does make hair feel a bit more course, but does wonders in keeping my second, and sometimes third day hair, less flat.</li>
    <li> I have tried around 30 dry shampoos and this one just dose not seem to get the oil out of my hair. It leaves my hair white and dull but I seem to still have the oil.I have tried to let this sit longer to see if it would work more for my type of hair but it seem to be do the same no matter what.  I do like the smell of this product.  I like the Dove Dry Shampoo much for the oil control and it gives me tones of body. I have very fine dark hair so this could work on someone else with different textured hair.</li>
    <li> Awful.  If anything it makes my hair greasy , or more so. One star because it smells really good. But doesn&#x27;t work at all . Better ones on the market I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel like I just washed it!</li>
    <li> Garnier Fructis Volume Extend Instant Bodifier Dry Shampoo is a must-have product for the serious stylist and a go-to product for women who want to freshen up while traveling, or just get out of the house in a hurry in the morning.  If you&#x27;ve got limp, fine or naturally straight hair (I do!) this dry shampoo will poof you up in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dry shampoo gives new life to &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;third day&amp;#34; hair, if you&#x27;re camping or hospitalized. For me, it&#x27;s a better boost for styling than mousse and hairspray, because it doesn&#x27;t flatten my naturally-flat hair and give it that sticky look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the kind for fine or flat hair, and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t flake, turn powdery or sticky.  You won&#x27;t even feel it, and the only evidence that you&#x27;ve used it is your full-body, gleaming hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.</li>
    <li> Not having to wash my long hair every single day and getting the bonus of 2nd day hair flexibility is great on its own.  The extra time savings in the morning is worth the cost alone - and the can lasts surprisingly long.  Blows other products away, even the 20+ dollar ones</li>
    <li> Light floral sweet smell. I have light brown hair and it did leave a white residue after brushing it out. Not a huge deal with me but if it is for you try batiste medium brown or brown if you have darker hair.</li>
    <li> It not only cleans but I love the fresh scent.  And as advertised it adds body to my very thin hair.  Fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve reordered and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to add volume OR body. Quite the opposite actually!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> I have absolutely loved this product, with thin hair it gets stringy the next day after I wash it. Spray a little  shampoo and brush it through until the white is gone, and pooof! Magically clean and voluminous once again. Not only that but my boyfriend and I both love the light, tangy fruity tropical smell of fructis brand.</li>
    <li> I am in my 60s and my hair has become thinner but this product works so well to add fullness and body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I mainly spray it on the top/back part of my head, wait for it to dry (dries very quickly!), comb it through, style as usual and you cannot see any scalp showing though!  I sometimes use it all over my head if I want a particularly full and long-lasting hair style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is invisible and has no lasting odor. I use it every other day and you cannot tell that I&#x27;ve skipped a shampoo!  Great product for anyone at any age who has fine, limp, and/or thinning hair to add more body and the impression of thickness!  Works very well for &amp;#34;bed-head&amp;#34;, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb oils very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a magazine article, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It smells great, removes excess oil and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos because we have frequent power outages where I live, but either they leave a residue or smell icky or are too pricey.  This Garnier product is the best by far. That&#x27;s why I gave a top rating.</li>
    <li> I have very long blonde hair and don&#x27;t like to wash it every day so in the summer my bangs need a little help and this does the trick. I love this dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Gives hair body and feels cool and clean.  The smell is strong, sweet, and fruity.  Works very well.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as much body as some I&#x27;ve tried, but smells good enough to make up for it.</li>
    <li> Not the very best but darn good enough and the smell is fantastic! I keep one on hand if I just need a quick refreshing.</li>
    <li> Works on decreasing oil but leaves a white dusty film on my hair after spraying</li>
    <li> Works well, not to stiff, no dust left over and smells good</li>
    <li> Love how great this smells. It really absorbs the excess oil from my hair and scalp. Great dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> Works great, and smells wonderful!!!! No white residue left in my hair and perks up greasy unwashed hair very nicely! Gets me through the in between wash days just great!!! Price is right too!</li>
    <li> Seems decent. I do prefer the Batiste brand. But for the price, this is a good value.</li>
    <li> Easy to use between washes and takes the oil out of my hair</li>
    <li> This does what it claims to do.  I dont love the smell, but it does fade pretty quickly.  No residue, leaves scalp feeling clean, and hair isnt sticky or matted.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo that I have ever use. It has great volume good for flat or thin hair</li>
    <li> Makes my hair more greasy than anything :/</li>
    <li> This is great for the price. I use it on the days that I don&#x27;t have time to wash my fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t have build up and no white powder left behind. My only complaint is that the bottle is on the small side.</li>
    <li> Convenient , smells nice and does the job without a lot of residue.Less expensive then salon brands and works as well for a less expensive price.</li>
    <li> Product made my hair smell great...I use garnier as a dry shampoo and only wash my hair once a week since my hair is thick and dry....you would never know it....</li>
    <li> Works great for adding volume &amp; helping to style very fine hair. I have tried very expensive dry spray shampoo (bumble &amp; bumble) &amp; more moderately priced (sephora). This works great -- comparable to the b&amp;b &amp; better than the sephora. Even better, this is much cheaper. I will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this product, it is not as good as the Batiste Dry Shampoo. I have tried a few others but will stick with Batiste.</li>
    <li> If I 100/10, this is a must must must have product especially if you have lighter hair. It&#x27;s going to give a ton of volume and make 3 day out of shower hair look fresh and smell AMAZING. Would recommend to anyone regardless of hair color, texture, or fullness.</li>
    <li> Decent inexpensive dry shampoo, I usually get the good professional lines, but when in a pinch this ones good enough for the price. I have to have dry shampoos and only the powder ones, even with dark hair. The other kinds seem to make my hair more greasy looking.</li>
    <li> Absolutely did not make my hair look cleaner. I actually think it made it worse and I had to actually wash it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with dry shampoo, but I&#x27;m not impressed with this. Too much and my hair looks gray, and even just a touch has a very perfumed odor. Not for sensitive noses.</li>
    <li> Best invention ever.!</li>
    <li> not the best quality- takes a bit for it to dry out once you spray it on and gray residue is very noticeable</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Really helps my hair stay fuller and fresh in between washes.  Smells great! Only complaint is that it seems to run out more quickly, so buy a multi pack! I have color treated hair, blonde, and has no issues with it affecting my color.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty thick so I don&#x27;t get very much volume from the dry shampoo, but it takes away the oil if it&#x27;s not freshly washed.  I love just using it on my bangs throughout the day to keep them dry and in shape.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at removing the greasy look and leaves a horrible white residue that I can&#x27;t brush out, and I have very light hair! Suave works a lot better!</li>
    <li> This Dry Shampoo works great for the price.  I use it every other day and does not dull my hair as much as others that I have tried.  Great Value!</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about trying dry shampoo for awhile, but finally decided to go for it once I read somewhere that dry shampoo is great for thickening hair.  My hair started thinning when I was in my 20s, and if I don&#x27;t style it very carefully, you can see hints of scalp (which is the worst!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo for a week, I am totally hooked.  I use it every morning.  I shower at night and wash my hair every other day, but I use this every morning regardless of how clean my hair is, just because it does such a good job at thickening.  I spray it around my head, then brush through, and voila:  my hair strands look thicker, the roots are lifted, and my hair just looks so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder is white/gray, which I can tell when I spray it.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the powder disappearing after brushing it through, except for one morning that I sprayed it really close to my head (instead of the 6-8 inches away that&#x27;s recommended).  Otherwise, you can&#x27;t see any of the shampoo in my dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight, pleasant scent.  I think it&#x27;s milder than other scents I&#x27;ve gotten from Garnier products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!  I will keep getting more &amp; more of this!</li>
    <li> This product smells so nice. I really want it to work. But it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s like spraying nice perfume on your hair. I have still have oily hair just scented lovely. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It works great with my hair, it&#x27;s a very good for the time when you&#x27;re running late and you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair it really works. Like it!!</li>
    <li> I loved this product i work out in the mornings so when i come home from the gym my hair is pretty sweaty i don&#x27;t have time every morning to wash my hair before work so I tried this product and my hair looks great and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to love this product as I am a big fan of Garnier Fructis and an avid user of dry shampoo. While this product smelled AMAZING (a quality that is sometimes hard to find in dry shampoos), it simply did not give the body/degreasing job that other brands did. I had to use a LOT of it to get the results I was looking for, and I found that the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; remnants that dry shampoos sometimes have were harder to rub in/out than other brands. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> My sister in law loved it! I bought it for her to try.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. I have been looking for something to use because I can&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; to curl it without it becoming an oil slick. This product has been great for solving that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned a couple of tricks to help use it. I am a brunette, so when I first apply it the product leaves a white powdery look that require some work to work in. I have now swapped to putting it in my hair the night before a &amp;#34;no wash&amp;#34; day and let it work itself in as I sleep. This eliminates a lot of work for me. I have managed one day with my hair looking great and a second day with it looking OK (passable if I was to put it up in a bun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about pricing yet between here and the store, but I love the convince of just  having it shipped to my house</li>
    <li> My hair is fine &amp; picky.  This didn&#x27;t work as well for me as I had hoped but I have a friend who I gave it to and it worked fine for her.  Depends on the user I think.  shipped fast &amp; nothing wrong with it, my hair is just weird.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Love this stuff! It smells so much better than most other brands and doesn&#x27;t overly dry.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, easy to use, won&#x27;t leave dusty residue.</li>
    <li> I use dry shampoos not only inbetween washes, but to add volume. This product smells great and does its job. It also hasn&#x27;t clogged yet like my other dry shampoos tend to do.</li>
    <li> This is my first try of dry shampoo. I&#x27;ll not be doing this again I don&#x27;t think. I followed the instructions. My hair looks NO different, feels NO different than had I not used this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like spraying my hair with air then combing it. I can do that for free with a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this dry shampoo! mainly because a lot of other dry shampoos smell weird but this one smells pretty great! kind fruity smell</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling dry shampoo. And works well too!</li>
    <li> I like it, but my hair looks powdery. Not a good look when you have dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> works great will use alot for camping</li>
    <li> It smells good like most Garnier products but it doesn&#x27;t clean the hair or give much volume at all.  I like the herbel essence dry shampoo much better.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to dry shampoo! It smells great and leaves hair looking and FEELING fresh. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, hairspray-like feel that some others do. I have dark brown hair and I definitely have to work this into my hair a bit to get rid of the light coloring, but a little bit of brushing gets rid of it. I&#x27;d advise spraying the full 10 inches from your head and aiming this at the roots within your hair, rather than spraying it straight on and close up. This will save you a lot of time blending it in. My only complaint is that the can runs out WAY too fast.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dried shampoos and this is one of my least favorite. Leaves a ton of reside for very little oil control.</li>
    <li> Helps mask the 2-3 days of unwashed hair stage, but it only lasts for about 8-12 hours. Long enough to get through work without looking like you have limp, oily hair. That way, you can stretch out having to shampoo out all the color or flat iron work you put in.</li>
    <li> Does a solid job as a dry shampoo and bodifier. I find that most dry shampoos work just fine for me, but the make-or-break aspect is always the smell. This one smells fresh and fruity, rather than perfumed and chemically, so it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Smells like bad air freshener, breaks me out, leaves too much of a residue, I prefer another brand</li>
    <li> Smells good but not too strong (similar to other garnier products). Takes care of the grease without weighing down fine hair, although I always end up putting my hair up in a ponytail when I use this just in case it didn&#x27;t do as well by the end of a long day. Plan to buy again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I like to wash my hair every other day so it doesn&#x27;t dry out so much.  BUT- I life in the Sonoran Desert and I walk every day.  Even waiting till sunset means it&#x27;s still over 100 degrees in the summer.  So washing every day is pretty much a necessity.  This product keeps my hair much fresher when I need to take a no shampoo day in the summer.  It definitely makes my hair smell pretty.  Caveat- you do have to brush vigorously to get the powder look out if you have thick hair like I do.</li>
    <li> Liked product a lot and most likely  will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Can leave a white residue. So be careful not to spray too close. Other than that, I&#x27;d prob buy it again.</li>
    <li> this will boost your hair like no other, it wil lhave it looking good right after you flat iron it</li>
    <li> great product and price.  nice scent.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Smells great and makes my hair look freshly washed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it doesn&#x27;t leave any powder residue. Smells fresh and works great</li>
    <li> Of all the brands of dry shampoo I have tried, this is the only one that really didn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; my hair. It smells good and goes on without a lot of residue, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb any oil. It does give my hair more body---making it a little difficult to comb and style, in fact---but it is a failure as a hair refresher. This should probably just be marketed as a texturing product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This works really well, but sometimes it leaves a waxy coating on my hair. No one seems to notice it though, so its worth it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes a long way now that I have shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair is just hopeless, but this did nothing for me volume-wise. Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as a dry shampoo as other brands have, either. Smells lovely, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Buying a dry shampoo can be a daunting task since it requires your going out and buying (and buying and buying and buying…) many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one. I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: My hair is dark, thick, extremely long, and wavy with oily roots and dry ends. So please keep in mind the results may not be the same for you if your hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like nondescript citrus, unisex fragrance, similar to generic hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Cherry: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like red fruits but somewhat synthetic. I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos. The fragrance is on the feminine side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Volume Extend dry shampoo: Leaves white residue but goes away as you massage you scalp clean. It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair. Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus. Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences Color Me Happy dry shampoo: Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair. The unfortunate consequence of this “dumping” however, thickens and volumizes the hair to a point where it hurts to comb fingers through. Hair becomes hard and tough to style. Some folks with fine/limp hair may actually appreciate this. Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo. The fragrance is that of sweet roses. It is on the perfume-y and feminine side. Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind. Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through. Truly a “just washed and done” effect. Smells like nondescript powdery citrus. Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind. Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair. Smells like bright, sweet citrus. The price point and availability at every corner makes this an attractive choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Matte dry shampoo: Cleans with low-to-mediocre effectiveness. Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing. Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots. I always end up looking like part-broccoli / part-hedgehog after that is done. The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction. It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned. :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SheaMoisture Peace Rose Oil dry shampoo: Cleans with effectively. Doesn’t leave a residue behind, even on my pitch black hair. Because it is a powder you squeeze out of a bottle (non-aerosol), it didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;choking feeling&amp;#34; I get from spraying dry shampoo all over my head. The smell was a true rose oil scent. It is on the feminine side, so those who prefer a neutral or masculine fragrance might not like it. It is long lasting but stays close so that you don’t “advertise” your hair fragrance throughout the day, so to speak. Lasted a long time as well. Has a volumizing effect too, in case that&#x27;s also important to you. It looks small but it lasted longer than its spray counterparts. One drawback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too. Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head. I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it. All in all, I’d rather deal with this problem than the rest. Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc. It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far. (I might just keep buying this until the inevitable discontinuation happens. Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc. ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly? Does that happen to you too? :-] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this comparison helped you. Look out for updates as I continue to search for a great dry shampoo that doesn’t leave residue, cleans effectively, doesn’t make the hair rigid, smells awesome and, most important, one that is affordable.awback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too. Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head. I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it. All in all, I’d rather deal with this problem than the rest. Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc. It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far.

    <li> I like this brand as it does not make your hair feel stiff or hard and does not leave the white residue everywhere. The smell is great too. I recommend this for anyone who needs a refresher if you do not wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> It really works. Have to be carefull when is almost finish, have to chake it very well cause it turns your hair gray if you have black hair like me. My hair after I go to the salon gets oily after 2 or 3 days, this helps me to get through the end of the week. Recommended</li>
    <li> doesnt work well, even if you use a lot.  And you have to blow off the white residue.  Buy Suave insyead</li>
    <li> Quick &amp; easy when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair, Has a pleasant fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat the price for this dry shampoo, when most alternatives I&#x27;ve seen in stores -- both drugstores and high-end -- are $8-10+ for the same amount of product. I find I go through dry shampoo relatively quickly since I have a lot of hair, and so it&#x27;s hard for me to justify spending more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the great value, this is actually way better than any of the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve used PSSSST... dry shampoo and Batiste in the past), but this one smells great, makes my hair super fluffy and light, and the white residue is really easy to brush through by just hand-brushing vigorously against my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays I just have this on subscription re-order, because I go through it so frequently, which is the only downside -- but that&#x27;s true of all dry shampoos if you&#x27;re using it every other day when you don&#x27;t shampoo (at least for me, my hair gets pretty greasy/flat by day 2, so dry shampoo is a godsend).</li>
    <li> works well and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> This is the best hair thickening spray ever.</li>
    <li> Love it for those days I just need my hair to go a little bit further without washing it. Use it as an emergency item but I love that I have it for those days!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad can, but it just seems like I&#x27;m spraying fragrant air into my hair.  There&#x27;s no dry shampoo substance in here.  It does nothing for my hair (and I have simple, fine hair).</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and use this bodifier with hair spray and do NOT need to perm my hair to look like I have double the amount of hair. This does NOT go on sale in the stores, so I bought in bulk online from Amazon to get a much better price with free shipping. Smells good and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever tried and I have tried dozens. I had tried a different dry shampoo by Garnier a while back and hated it, but this one is much different. It is super lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue on my scalp or make my hair feel like straw. I saw a few negative reviews, I have very fine blonde hair so maybe it depends on your hair type, but I love it and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Smells good. However not one of the best dry shampoo to keep your hair less greasy.</li>
    <li> never tried dry shampoo before, seems to work well enough esp for the price</li>
