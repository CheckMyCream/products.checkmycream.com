<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s call this the Magic Brush, they used to dread when I got the hairbrush out but now they don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have long hair and this brush works great to get out the tangles both after shampooing when the hair is wet and also when the hair is dry.  I have found that it does not break my hair or pull, it just glides through my hair.  I also use it when blow- drying my hair with the same results.  I highly recommend this brush.  My granddaughter calls it the &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Daughter twists her hair and ends up in knots.  We couldn&#x27;t find any way to get her hair untangled and sometimes it was so bad we had to cut her hair.  This brush works miracles.  Ater a bath, when the hair is wet, the brush slowly removes all the tangles and it doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all.  Love this so much we bought two.</li>
    <li> this brush is great for my hair because not only does it help with the tangles, but it does so without pulling at my scalp and tearing through the knots. altogether awesome product</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t get it,  it&#x27;s just a brush. It&#x27;s an okay brush. There&#x27;s nothing special that makes it detangle . It works okay on my hair (very long,  medium thickness) and my daughter&#x27;s very fine,  short hair,  but there nothing special about it for wet hair except maybe the texture of the handle. It&#x27;s easier to hold when wet but the bristles are totally normal.</li>
    <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when brushing her hair.</li>
    <li> Love it very good for my hair. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair brush I have ever had. Try it. what do you have too lose ?</li>
    <li> Not that good in quality.</li>
    <li> So I have had this brush for a little while now and I LOVE IT! I have very thick hair that is colored and always had a horrible time getting through it with my paddle brush as it tangles easily. I would shampoo/condition in the shower and then put in biosilk and detangler to help with the brushing and it still took me 7-10 minutes to brush and it hurt. I complained to my hubby all the time. NOT ANY MORE!! The hype on this brush is real! I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but I can brush through my hair in a minute. I still use biosilk and detangler, but this brush glides through it. I ordered one for my friend who has the same issue and she said she uses it throughout the day and her hair is visibly shinier. Funny story - We just got back from vacation and I packed the brush in my front compartment. When I got it out the bristles were all bent and I was super bummed and thought it was ruined. I got online and ordered another one immediately. 2 days later, the brush was back to normal! I guess it just needed time to get warm and all of the bristles straightened themselves back out. Now I have a back up just in case!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after my hair dresser recommended it. I have long, frizzy, and fine hair. It&#x27;s always a tangled mess after the end of the day and even worse after washing it. This brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t pull a bunch of hair out everytime you brush your hair and it glides pretty gently through tangles either wet or dry. I&#x27;ve tried lots of brushes, this one is the best!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve used so far! Easy to comb through with minimum pull and pain.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I didn&#x27;t believe the hype, but was willing to try almost anything to end the nightly argument with my 2 year old over brushing her hair. This &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34; really works! No tangles, no pain, and smooth hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is weak and tends to break after taking a shower.  This is the first brush that I&#x27;ve used that has a minimal amount of hair pulled.  Very gentle.</li>
    <li> This is amazing...no more pain!</li>
    <li> WHERE WAS THIS PRODUCT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL? Really, it would have saved my poor mother from endless nights of whining and crying because it hurt when she brushed my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have an extremely sensitive scalp and this brush is actually a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Cute color and nice size. VERY soft. Squishes when you brush your hair. Good for detangling wet tresses, without ripping out hair when you encounter a knot.</li>
    <li> Love this brush on my long, thin hair. Also use on my daughter with no complaints!</li>
    <li> My hair has always been so difficult to brush when it is wet and I am clueless as to why. I have healthy long hair. It may just be the texture or the waves, but this brush has made it so much easier. It used to take me at least 20 mins to brush the knots out of my hair after the shower. My sister got this for herself and I decided to use it thinking &amp;#34;eh I doubt it will work&amp;#34;. But boy was I wrong! The brush gets out every knot and tangle without me feeling a thing. And I&#x27;m done brushing my hair within 5 mins!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it. (:</li>
    <li> Came quickly and this brush is amazing!  Will probably buy more!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when my hair dresser told me about this hair brush... I typically brush my hair before I shower then during the shower when I condition. Then I load it up with detangler and start hacking away. Tonight was my first go with the wet brush and I put it to the ultimate test: 3 days hair unwashed/unbrushed and not brushed before or during my shower, also no detangler spray. I was AMAZED. So amazed that I had to write a review and I never write reviews. This brush is magic.</li>
    <li> My daughter used to donkey kick me because of pain while brushing her hair. This brush is perfect. She even wants to brush her own long hair now because it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> It works ok. Nothing amazing about this hair brush. I thought it would be a lot better for my girls hair.</li>
    <li> any long-haired person who showers needs this. Period.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical when the lady cutting my daughter&#x27;s hair insisted that we needed to try this brush. My daughter&#x27;s hair is long, thick and rather coarse. Quite frankly I was tired about having to nag her to brush it and she was tired of it hurting every time she tried. Honestly, part of me thought it was the hair dresser just trying to sell us a product, but even when she saw they were out of stock, she told me other places I could purchase it. I came home and ordered the brush on Amazon, thinking if we hated it, we were only out the cost of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair brush is awesome. Seriously. Our mornings are much more peaceful now that my daughter&#x27;s not dreading brushing her hair. It works wet as well as dry and she liked it so much I ordered a two-pack in different colors so we each have one. I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with this purchase and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> works better than your average brush</li>
    <li> This changed our evening hair brushing from a battle to quality time.  Works as described!</li>
    <li> The brush smelled terrible when I removed it from its package - Think of a foul plastic, rubber smell. I attempted to wash it with a warm-water, mild-soap solution and it didn&#x27;t help. I left the brush out on a counter in the garage for over a week hoping the smell would diminish with no such luck. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> everyone who has long hair needs the wet brush. I am a believer!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> My baby fine hair gets damaged &amp; breaks easily.  When I use this brush in the shower in the mornings, it detangles my hair with minimal breakage.  I took it on vacation and used it on the beach after swimming &amp; it worked great.  It&#x27;s not a great styling tool - but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to be.</li>
    <li> recommended by my hair stylest...love it!</li>
    <li> I bought a wet brush because everyone was saying it was the greatest thing ever for long hair.  I have very long, thick hair, so I was excited to try this &amp;#34;amazing brush&amp;#34;.  It works well for brushing wet hair; however, I used it while I was blow drying my hair and all of the bristles bent to the point where I cannot use it anymore.  So, I guess if you are just going to brush your hair and not blow dry it would be okay, but don&#x27;t buy this brush if you think you will be able to use it while blow drying!</li>
    <li> My dogs love it and that is what counts!  I have one dog that does not like to be brushed or combed and she enjoys this.</li>
    <li> This brush is a miracle. I have long, fine curly hair that I have been bleaching for the last couple of years. It is super dry and it gets very tangled. Brushing used to be a nightmare until I got this brush. I seriously don&#x27;t understand. It goes through my hair about 10 times, and no tangles. Huge improvement on my previous ten minutes of painful brushing. Now, no pain, just untangled hair. Thank you, Dr. Zizmor!</li>
    <li> Works great in daughters knotty curly hair.  Only brush we use for her now.</li>
    <li> if your hair gets knotty... this is a MUST buy!!!! DO NOT WAIT ORDER THIS BRUSH TODAY!!!!!!!! My hair is healthier and I lose less to breakage than ever before!  Use it was a great conditioner in the shower.</li>
    <li> Honestly will never buy a regular brush again. Including myself I have 4 girls with long hair in my house and this has saved our hair and the agitation we get from ripping tangles out!  Until I ordered this one this week we only had one brush like this and everyone was always looking for the good brush! So glad I found these!</li>
    <li> My 9 year old loves this.  It goes through her hair more easily than other brushes and doesn&#x27;t pull on the knots.  She loves the pink color and it works really well. .no tears!  It makes brushing and styling her hair so much easier and quicker!</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this brush! I have very thick,and wavy long hair which can take 10-15 minutes to brush out on a good day! I always dreaded showering or swimming because of how much it&#x27;d hurt to brush my hair out. (I also couldn&#x27;t brush my hair on my own because of all the tangles.) When the brush arrived I was skeptical because it looked like many other brushes I had tried out which always failed to get the tangles out, and left my scalpe crying in pain. For once I am extremely happy to be proven wrong! This amazing brush got every single tangle out of my hair in less than 2 minutes. I actually timed it. I also noted that it did not hurt at all either!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Combs thick wavy hair effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on both wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels softer&lt;br /&gt;DOESN\\&quot;T HURT AT ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: (Barely even a con)&lt;br /&gt;It takes me a minute or two to pull all the hair out of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. I will be buying more to give out to family and friends and to have in stock as well!</li>
    <li> WORKS PERFECT ! THE BEST BRUSH EVER,NOW I CAN BRUSH MY HAIR TWICE IN A DAY WITHOUT PAIN ,UNBELIVABLE AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I have a 3 year old girl with very long hair. She is forever getting stuff in her hair  (food, art supplies, nature...) there are many tangles. Sometimes brushing her hair has been a struggle. This brush was recommend by a friend. IT WORKS. It glideseasily through tangles and on really bad ones the pull is minimal. I don&#x27;t know what magic this is made of but it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who swears it ended the bedtime hair brushing battles in her home.  I was skeptical, but it really works!  Of course there are still some tangles that require tugging, but this has really made brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier and less dramatic.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It works great with fine or thick hair. I love the hair brushes with these non-slip handles. The bristles also work well with either wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, the bristles are soft, it won&#x27;t pull your hair. This makes detangling easy.</li>
    <li> best brush I ever had!</li>
    <li> I have three daughters and this brush gets us through the tangles without tears! I now own at least 5 regular sized and a mini one for my bag for on the go. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this as much as everyone said they did. Although it does work well on wet hair, my daughter still complains when I brush her long hair. I expect some complaining, no big deal. My biggest complaint is that after 6 months of using the brush the bristles are not holding up. Some are missing the rubber dot on the tip, and all the bristles in the middle of the brush push into the  brush. I have to pull them back out to the proper length when I use the brush. I would expect a brush to last longer than 6 months.</li>
    <li> Our daughter&#x27;s hair has so many tangles after bath or bedtime and combing her hair was tough on everyone.  This brush does work miracles and she no longer cries at the thought of us getting the tangles out.</li>
    <li> This brush has saved many a tears from my grandaughter...her hair gets so tangled after washing, but this brush goes right thru....great purchase!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Doesn&#x27;t get caught in my tangled mess.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters with thick hair. My oldest has hair that is wavy and my youngest has curly hair. I wouldn&#x27;t call her hair the thick curly that some girls have. This brush glides through their hair without any effort. I usually start with this brush when their hair is freshly wet from the shower. I even use it on my own hair with my hair dryer when I blow dry it straight. GREAT GREAT Brush! It has saved many tears!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush at Target a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;ve been loving it ever since! It&#x27;s the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my hair! The best part about this brush, that it is pain free! It helps me get rid of knots and tangles. And it is magical! Everyone need to buy this brush! It&#x27;s a must have for everyone!</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush! I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without it. This would of been a dream come true to my 5 year old self that had hair down to here waist and HATED getting her hair brushed. My hair now is SUPER thick and once again down to my waist and this is the ONLY brush that can go straight through my wet hair in one swipe. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Works like magic at brushing out wet hair.</li>
    <li> The comb is very good to use.I like it.</li>
    <li> Not good . Save your money and get another brush</li>
    <li> Awesome my daughters have spiral knotty curls and they already voiced that this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt like our old &amp;#34;wet hair brush&amp;#34; (not this brand). We use homemade detangle spray also but loving the brush!</li>
    <li> My 11-year-old won&#x27;t use any other brush, and when this is missing (a lot) she flips out. Buy two. Spotted it at the Korean hair salon yesterday.</li>
    <li> Great brush...really helps with tangles</li>
    <li> All the bristles slowly fell out of my 20 year old brush that gently detangles my hair. I have bought 5 brushes, over that time period, in hopes they could replace this old deteriorating brush. None could do it. I was down to less than half the bristles and a ripping pad when I found this brush. Gave it a try and it works BETTER than the one I held onto for so long. Now my long hair is safe and will quit breaking off. I love it.</li>
    <li> Keeps the tangles away! Love this brush!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever.  With three girls having long hair, I was sick of the whining when brushing through knots.  It makes brushing dry or wet hair effortless.  We now have 4 in the house!</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter loves this! I don&#x27;t know how or why this brush is different from others, but I do know it works wonders. My daughter always hated brushing her hair with her old brush, and it would take her a long time. When using this new wet brush however, it takes her seconds to brush through her hair, which is long. Her hair is naturally wavy so it can be hard to comb through right after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this can be used on both dry and wet hair. She has used this for about a week and is so much happier with her morning routine! I may have to buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> I read soo many good reviews I had to see what the fuss was about. I ordered  a brush for my 8 year old sister. She has a lot of hair and it&#x27;s wavy and she hates having it brushed. Well she approved of the brush and actually like to brush her hair herself now.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair which tends to snag. I was able to come through it with out breaking any of my ends. Soooo I prefers myself one as well.</li>
    <li> I have long,fine,color treated naturally wavy hair. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it did as good a job in leaving the wave and leaving my hair nice looking as slow,careful,gentle combing does with a detangling comb. BUT,for quick detangling without breaking or pulling,it gets five stars. I read reviews here and also the principle it works on,and I almost ordered it. Then a little later that week I saw it in a local beauty supply store and got it after deciding not to get it first,in the store. My hair is very fine and I like to treat it gently to leave the wave in. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a bit of a pain in the butt to do it. Since I don&#x27;t own a brush and haven&#x27;t used one in more than 20 years,I thought this one would be a good first step. It is. I think I&#x27;ll still opt for slow and careful combing most of the time,(which is combing long hair in small sections,starting at the bottom rather than the top,and working your way up as you comb out the tangles so when you finally reach the hair at your part,and comb down to the ends,all of the tangles have already been removed,so your hair doesn&#x27;t break or pull or become damaged). But The Wet Brush does do a good job of taking out tangles quickly,without being damaging and I do like it. The real fault may be that some of my hair is less healthy than most of it. And those are the parts that are left wispy looking after brushing. So maybe my hair really deserves 3 or 4 stars and the brush deserves five. I&#x27;m sure if I used The Wet Brush and brushed in a nice vegan leave-in conditioner or conditioning detangler like Original Sprout,the wispy and flyaway ends would be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still glad I bought this and I will be using it.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the wet brush yet, you&#x27;re missing out.  This brush is magic.  I wish this existed when I was a child.  It would have led to a lot less tantrums and a lot nicer school pictures for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it says it works great on wet hair, not one pull, tug, snarl or knot to be had.  I also find it works well on my hair when it was dry, but I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews from some of my friends when they use it on dry hair.  Its the only brush I use anymore.  My mom originally got me the mini brush as a stocking stuffer years ago.  After using the teeny mini brush for a few years I finally decided it was time to upgrade to a big-girl sized brush :)</li>
    <li> This brush is the best brush.It glides through my hair and even when I have a tangle it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
    <li> It is a good bush for wet hair.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair, and I had the worst tangles even when using conditioner and detangler. . A new hairstylist used it on my hair, and it was absolutely amazing! I have recommended it to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> My hair is down to my waist.  I highlight my brown hair blonde every six weeks. Lately I have noticed more and more hair left in my brush. I was not sure why? I purchased this brush after I had several stylists recommend this. I just colored my hair and normally after a lot more comes out on my brush after the shower. But this time barley any hair in the brush. I originally bought this for my daughters to help them get through brushing. But after trying I am going to have to buy one for my self as well. Less hair in the brush and less pain while brushing. Better for me and has to be better for my wet hair. When your hair is wet your hair follicles expand making it easier for you to loose..... Wish I would of know about this years ago. I would highly recommend this to any one that has noticed &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; hair in their hair brush. I would like to add this brush is for wet hair not dry. I still have a paddle brush for dry hair.</li>
    <li> I will never use another brush, ever. This brush is absolutely amazing. I have really fine hair. A lot of brushes tangle my hair and pull it out. This brush is so gentle and gets out tangles so well. I was skeptical before purchasing one, but after my hairdresser showed it to me, I was in love. I don&#x27;t lose nearly as much hair anymore.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST brush EVER! Does exactly what it says- easy, smooth &amp; no pulling on hair. It is AWESOME SAUCE!</li>
    <li> She didn&#x27;t want it because she said she already had a brush. But I bought it anyway and she liked that she can brush her hair while washing her hair, and continue until her hair is dry.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th wet brush purchase! I can&#x27;t get enough of these!&lt;br /&gt;I was originally introduced to the wet brush by my hair stylist and was immediately in love!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the family has one now and you can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> Great product! Glad I bought 2!</li>
    <li> Works great on curly hair too!</li>
    <li> I have tried every comb, brush, conditioner, and de-tangler for long hair.  Other than a wide tooth comb nothing has worked until this brush.  Hooray!  It doesn&#x27;t eliminate pulling of the hair entirely- I still have to be careful with that, but with persistence it does work and detangle hair.  I ordered multiple brushes.</li>
    <li> First off, I was not expecting this horrible rubber smell coming off of it that still lingers to this day. The brush was also heavier than I expected. Appearance wise aside, I do applaud on the brush&#x27;s job in detangling my hair without too much yanking as compared to my other brushes. But unlike my older brushes, this one seems to make my hair more flat and oily looking. Dust also accumulates pretty quickly on this, which makes it difficult to wash since the bristles are pretty tall. Overall, this product is overpriced for a brush that just detangles.</li>
    <li> We have had to take combs and brushes and our whole spritz collection into OT and beg for help combing hair! This is a dream! Well worth the price tag! I will be ordering more! We are all in love with this product! Sensory parents you absolutely need this!</li>
    <li> I have lots of long hair and this thing is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t pull the tangles yet somehow gets out all the knots like magic! Brushing wet hair never felt so good. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the pink brush, but the little wire BRISTLES bend out of shape very easy, and I have short hair ! I hope it lasts longer then I expect !  I will let you know !!!</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this brush. It&#x27;s worth every penny and more!  I have two and a mini for my daughter. I have very thick hair and a lot of hair-so I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brushes. This one is hands down the best!  It glides through my hair and tangles and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. You won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
    <li> love it especially for the $</li>
    <li> I bought this brush only because a friend kept saying how great it was. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, as I&#x27;ve tried so called &amp;#34;no pull&amp;#34; brushes before, which don&#x27;t pull, but also don&#x27;t go through your hair and leave all the tangles behind. The first time I used the Wet Brush it felt like it was doing the same as the others, and I assumed I just wasted money again. However, after using the brush, I ran my fingers through my hair and almost every tangle was gone! I hadn&#x27;t even felt it pulling at all and my hair goes more than halfway down my back. I really like this brush and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this brush. I have noticed a significant decrease in frizz and broken hair since I started using it.My curly headed daughter loves it because it goes tangles through much smoother than other brushes.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best brush I have owned in my entire life. My daughter has very long hair and it goes through that wet tangled mess like a champ. My hair stylist at the mall uses this same brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  My daughter 4yr old daughter has very long hair and a regular brush seemed to always really hurt her hair while combing it, so we decided to try this out and it was amazing.  It does not pull her hair while combing it and each bristle seems to have give to it and this was great for my daughter she does not seem to mind her hair getting combed near as much anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, and so does my step daughter.  Makes combing our hair out after a shower way better.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it makes brushing my three year olds hair so easy..even my older daughter only wants to use this brush. If is are third one</li>
    <li> I used to dread brushing my hair after showering. No matter how nice the conditioner worked, brushing my wet hair was always a nightmare and painful. I bought this and I have yet to have an uncomfortable hair-brushing experience since. It also works well on dry hair as well.</li>
    <li> Thus brush does not go right through tangled hair wet or dry as the ad states it does was not worth 8.00</li>
    <li> This brush is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my hair!</li>
    <li> It does work better than a traditional brush but I&#x27;m not totalky in love with it. I think it sort of skips over tangles when the hair is wet so later when it is dry there are more lasting tangles. I have super long, fine, but thick, blonde hair. It works great on my 15 month old. Overall it is a good brush but it hasn&#x27;t changed my life.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush. It cuts the time of brushing my wet hair to less than half the time than before and I notice that I lose less hair also. It isn&#x27;t completely tangle free (I still have some small knots, but definitely not as bad as before) and I would be surprised if it was all tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the best brush I have used and would buy again if it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;free shipping over $35&amp;#34;. C&#x27;mon Amazon, sometimes I don&#x27;t want to buy a bunch of stuff I don&#x27;t need just to get this one item. It&#x27;s such a hassle, and it is exactly why I brought the same brush at Walmart with free shipping! &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this brush works but it is magic!  It gets tangles out and doesn&#x27;t hurt! It&#x27;s a gentle detangler !</li>
    <li> Omg.best brush ever! I didn&#x27;t believe a brush  could smooth my hair this good nesides a straightening iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 4 years old.  I have never cut her hair.  It is waist length and tangles easily.  I would spend up to an hour trying to brush it out every morning while she sat there crying because the tangles hurt.  I was ready to chop all of her hair off when a friend suggested trying this brush.  Because my daughter cries even harder when I mention cutting her hair, I bought this brush and gave it a try.  Now, I can brush her hair while it&#x27;s wet or dry without her shedding a single tear.  I need to buy a back up just in case I loose one.</li>
    <li> My daughter has LOOOOOONG hair and hates getting her hair brushed.  Someone recommended this brush and I have sine bought two more.  It&#x27;s amazing.....I don&#x27;t know why, but it is!</li>
    <li> The granddaughters will brush their own hair now and it looks brushed.  The tangles seem to go away without their tears.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim after reading some of the reviews.  I regret nothing!  This brush is amazing.  I was skeptical because it looks like any other brush you can find at the store.  But, it works wonders.  My hair gets very tangled in the shower and is such a pain to brush out.  It is straight, fine, and long with few layers.  No detangling spray ever seemed to do the trick.  I destroyed so many strands by using a regular brush and comb to get all of the tangles out.  This wet brush seems to just glide right through the tangles.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It was a feeling of utter joy.  I had finally found a way to tame my unruly hair.  Though, it sometimes doesn&#x27;t seem to get to the layers beneath, so I have to apply a decent amount of pressure if I want to detangle everything.  I also section my hair in multiple places to make sure I get everything, something that I didn&#x27;t do before.  Even with just that little extra work I now do, I still think this is the best brush ever.  Believe all the positive reviews you see here.  Don&#x27;t doubt them and get this brush.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Very gentle even with big tangles.  The brush is nice and light and easy to grip. This is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Tried this brush for my grandchildren&#x27;s hair.  They never wanted their hair brushed because it hurt to brush the snarls out.  but the girls now don&#x27;t mind at all and LOVE this brush.  Somehow it does the job without causing tears! Works on wet and dry hair.  I have now purchased one for my house also.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it. I have been struggling with terrible knots and figured I needed to buy really expensive product to combat the knots. Thankfully all I needed was this incredible, affordable brush!!! It really works!! I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does. It gets through knots without yanking on hair. My hair is bleached so it&#x27;s already under stress. Because of this brush, my hair is no longer coming out in clumps of knots. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on wet or dry hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair like a lot of brushes do. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! My daughter and I don&#x27;t fight as much :)</li>
    <li> My 6 year old daughter gives this brush five stars! She has very curly, thick hair.</li>
    <li> MY BABY loves the brush.  no more crying when brushing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush its the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  I have bought 5 so far. They can literally brush and untangle wet hair quickly.  My daughter loves it as well.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This has saved my child&#x27;s hair!!!! They now carry these at the salon I go to because they are so amazing. We even use this brush for brushing our Goldendoodle!!! No more mats!! I tell everyone I know about this brush!</li>
    <li> My daughter used to cry and dread when I had to brush her hair.  Now, she brushes it on her own because it doesn&#x27;t hurt!!!</li>
    <li> This brush works wonders on tangled, wet hair! Some people have naturally curly hair, some have naturally straight hair, and I have naturally tangled hair... This brush, however, did a wonderful job of detangling it. I do use a sort of conditioner/detangler after I shower, so that does help a bit. Its nice and small and easily transported. Depending on my hairstyle, I&#x27;ll sometimes keep it in my purse for emergency hair situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush as a recommendation from my stylist. She sold similar brushes in her store for double the price that I got one for on Amazon. I know I, as well as many of my friends, are believers in the effectiveness of this brush. It seems to work well regardless of your hair type. It may not work miracles on veeery textured hair. But, for the average person, this brush works wonders. And of course it works well on dry hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good after-shower or day to day hair brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It works well and does not destroy my hair. I was a little skeptical at first, but so far, it has not given me any problems.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t we have wet brush when I was growing up?  I was raised to use a comb for wet hair.  It was such a pain to use a comb for wet hair and a brush for dry hair.  With the wet brush, I only need one beauty tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pink color!  It is really cute and fun to use.  The brush is perfect for wet and dry hair.  No issues with tugging my hair.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Works good for average brushing. For bad snarls, I prefer the Knot Genie because it gets the snarls out quicker</li>
    <li> Great brush for de-tangling/general brushing. Glides through my thick, coarse hair with easy, and the pink color is super cute.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic! I have long, extremely thick hair (goes past the middle of my back)and I can honestly say this is the only brush I have ever owned that doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, no matter how tangled and matted it is.&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing thing is that it takes MAYBE two minutes to brush through my hair, whereas it would take 15 or longer with a normal brush to work through the tangles. WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
    <li> Do you have daughters? Do they LOVE when you brush their nasty, tangled up hair after a day of playing and napping, crafting, eating, and sweating? HAHA! No, of course not.&lt;br /&gt;Before we discovered  this bush my daughters would always SCREAM when I told them to bring me their hairbrush. Nope, I promise there was no beating happening, just a loving mom brushing her girls&#x27; hair so they looked like someone cares about them. It always started and ended in screaming, with lots of screaming in between. No matter how gentle I was. No matter how much spray-in conditioner I used. No matter how many stories I told about how I hated having my hair brushed as a girl, too.  No matter how many times I threatened to have their hair cut short. NOTHING fixed the hairbrushing screaming fits.&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL THIS BRUSH!&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced it is made from the bristles of a magical fairy-enchanted animal, or some such. No more crying. No more fighting. Just sweet, well-groomed little girls who no longer look homeless all the time. Thank you WetBrush, you have saved my sanity, and saved my daughters years of therapy as adults.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have purchased three of them. It Works like magic.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  Perfect for easily tangled, damaged, processed hair.  I use it with wet or dry hair and takes about 1/4 of the time to get it brushed out.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I am in love with wet brushes. I have really long, tangly hair. This brush does miracles.I am always trying to find the best detangling products to use and this is a great one. I also use the It&#x27;s a 10 miracle spray. Both of these products are great!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair tangles easy,&lt;br /&gt;This brush is Awesome, goes through my hair easy.Wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself brushing my hair more. Love IT</li>
    <li> It does not penetrate deep enough to detangle inside hair and only hits outside portion.  Bristles are too flimsy to go deeper into the hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE it works great on my hair its my new favorite brush!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Less ripping of my long hair.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this item and says she absolutely loves it. One of the best brushes she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> A mom friend mentioned this to me and I was a skeptic ... but this is by far the best brush for a wiggly toddler.  Runs through my kiddo&#x27;s wet mop like nothing!</li>
    <li> I now have 2 of these.  I bought the first one on a recommendation from a lady at Church thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t make a difference but I could use another brush anyway.  I was so surprised when it actually made a difference.  My little girl is almost 3 years old with long hair.  Before this brush all I got was crying and screaming when trying to brush the tangles out of her hair.  I thought maybe it was just me but I noticed the same result when her mom brushed her hair.  The brush is not magic and I still get some pulls but it&#x27;s a night and day difference from the other brushes I&#x27;ve tried with my daughter.  As soon as I saw how well the brush worked I ordered a second one in case we lost one.</li>
    <li> Great brush for wet hair.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much I bought them for other people.  Awesome product that actually works...good for summer.</li>
    <li> The wet brush is very good. It works.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for tangles!</li>
    <li> my 6 year old granddaughter loves this brush.  She said it does not hurt when her hair is brushed using this.</li>
    <li> It detangles easily and also stimulates scalp. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this brush, every stylist I work with owns one.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic. They do take all knots outs. Soft bristles too. I don&#x27;t know how they do it. Excellent price too.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this brush from my salon and was really impressed!  I have medium length fine hair, that breaks and tangles easily.  After shampooing and conditioning, I would gently use a wide tooth comb, but I still managed to loose a lot of hair.  Also, when drying my hair with a round styling brush, the same thing would happen.  I can&#x27;t afford to loose anymore hair!  I find that there is hardly ever any hair in the Wet Brush. I also find that when I use it to style my hair (with the blow dryer) my hair seems a lot fuller.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is, but it&#x27;s definitely fuller.  I&#x27;ve bought this brush for my husband and for my mother now and they both love it too.  I can see the Wet Brush becoming this years hit stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I love the Wet Brush. Very good for children with long hair.  It&#x27;s like magic!! Untangles hair without pulling.  No more tears.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush. Every hairdresser should have one. It feta glee like no other. Happy, happy, happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!! My 4 year old daughter has long curly hair which has a tendency of getting knotty. Ahe would always cry when i would try to brush though her hair, specifically when it was dry. This brush is great even when her hair is dry!!</li>
    <li> It is heaven!! I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular brush again! My daughter is Hispanic with VERY curly hair. It is always an ordeal to brush her hair. She is VERY tender headed as well. I asked her to rate this brush out of 10 stars &amp; she gave it a 9 1/2. By the way, she&#x27;s never impressed with anything, but this brush sure made her HAPPY!!</li>
    <li> I love my wet brush!  I have bought one for each one of us in the family. They all kept stealing mine!  This is a softer bristle, so it does not pull hard on your hair when wet.  It detangles extremely well. I have such a sensitive scalp, it hurts.  This keeps me from wincing when I am brushing my hair after washing it.</li>
    <li> Best used on wet hair. Absolutely love this brush! My almost four year old daughter with long blond hair won&#x27;t let me use anything else. There is an odor, a strong rubber smell, to the brush but I haven&#x27;t even noticed since first opening it. Buy this!!!! :)</li>
    <li> My neighbor broke her elbow last week and was unable to brush her hair thoroughly with one hand. Apparently her boyfriend was no help either because he tried to help but failed (boys are stupid). Eight days later, she had legitimate dreads in the back of her head and thought she was going to have to have all her shoulder- length fine curly hair cut off. We decided to buy this brush first and see if we could save her hair. I dampened her hair and used some detangler and just worked methodically and slowly. With this brush, I was able to completely detangle her hair and eliminate her fears of a very unfortunate haircut. There was some hair that came out by the end of the process, but extremely little for 8-day dreads! I&#x27;ve seen worse in my own brush after just two days without brushing. This thing completely did the trick. If it can fix a weeklong situation, it can surely handle any day-to-day tangles. Can&#x27;t wait to get my own!</li>
    <li> My daughter, who is 3 yrs old and has hair to her but, used to cry and hate having her hair brushed. When we got this brush and combined it with the detangle spray that we were already using, she only complains about it (which is a HUGE improvement!) Even her dad can brush her hair now!</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter had such thin hair and it tangled so bad that after a bath she would cry&lt;br /&gt;when I would blow dry and comb it out. I was so happy that the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; actually worked&lt;br /&gt;and my daughter loves the color and her hair is so easy to comb and it is so shiny. I bought the paddle&lt;br /&gt;brush for my self. I love this brush so much I bought two extras just in case I loose one.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! My 2 year old daughter screamed bloody murder every time I tried to brush her hair but with this brush it doesn&#x27;t pull on her knotty hair so she is much happier which makes me much happier!!! I will def buy again and would def refer to friends. Also, I noticed her hair (which is half curly and half straight and really wild lol) looks much more smooth and pretty after brushing with this brush. Don&#x27;t hesitate if you&#x27;re on the fence. I usually never buy stuff I see on info commercials, but this brush works and I&#x27;m 100% glad I did.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It works on my slightly wavy/ straight long, fine hair that tangles easily and my daughters very curly thick hair! I only use the brush on her wet hair as I do not brush her curls when dry. She tells me she likes the pink brush because it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair and give her ouchies!</li>
    <li> Love it for myself but especially for my girls who hate to brush their hair! Works perfectly for wet hair. Detangles easily without pulling! Definitely recommend. Got the pink one for a little over $6.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that is a pain to brush when it&#x27;s wet. This brush detangles my hair like MAGIC - no breakage and it saves a ton of time.</li>
    <li> We have ended up purchasing several of these. My daughter is very tender headed and brushing her hair was horrible for the both of us. This brush goes through a rats nest like butter. It has made our lives so much easier! I am NEVER buying another brush again!</li>
    <li> This untangles my super-fine (think cat fur. It&#x27;s awful) hair even without the help of conditioner. I have no idea how it works, but pretty happy it does! Bought one for my husband&#x27;s beard as well, which is thick and curly (think Eric the Red) and it glides right through without snagging.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE Love.  Will not buy another brush!  It goes thru my daughters knots perfectly.  No more tearing and screaming.</li>
    <li> **Update!! Counterfeit Item!!** After purchasing this brush and using it MAYBE 30 times over the past four months. It&#x27;s been in my purse as just a backup brush and doesn&#x27;t get used nearly as much as my other pink Wet Brush. As others have stated, this HAS to be a knock off. Attached are three photos. Notice how the yellow brush&#x27;s bristles are gone or receded. I have had the pink Wet Brush for almost 9 months and have used it every single day with both wet and dry hair and it&#x27;s not even close to as damaged as the yellow brush. Notice the difference also in the writing of the logo. Amazon needs to get these sellers off of here!   I bought this as a back up purse brush after buying the Crave Naturals detangling brush because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the Crave brush. This brush can be used comfortably for left or right handed people. My Wet Brush is also made better in my opinion since the bristles don&#x27;t warp and bend after a month of uses. I have super fine curly hair and My Wet Brush is amazing and getting all of the knots out after a shower. I highly recommend this brush and will be buying more just in case the one I have gets lost!</li>
    <li> It did what it&#x27;s supposed to .. but my hair is like 2 ft long.. takes forever to brush through it.. less breakage, but still just seems a bit flimsy</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have really curly (afro) hair. When I first got this brush, I thought it was a godsend. Compared to my old brush, it&#x27;s really gentle. My only issue with this brush is that my hair occasionally wraps around the tips of this brush when it&#x27;s wet. It would be perfect if it didn&#x27;t have them at all.</li>
    <li> Love the brush! Had one before but it was black my daughter wanted pink!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH! Glides through my hair dry and wet so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all when it hits a knot. Goes through knots like butter. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived without it. Great for thick long hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s also lightweight. I&#x27;ll never use another brush</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Was so skeptical at first.  My daughter does not let me brush her hair and it gets extremely knotty.  Purchased this brush and she doesn&#x27;t complain anymore!  She lets me brush her hair and the knots are finally out!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Real Wet Brush unlike others sold here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We have a couple of detangling brushes for my daughter&#x27;s wavy hair and this is her favorite. Works on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!! It was recommended to me by my hairdresser when I asked her about getting knots out of my daughters hair. Her hair is long and super thick. The old brush just hurt so she went to school most days with knots in her hair. Now I can brush it with no pain and she even likes to brush it herself ! Love it</li>
    <li> Great brush. My first wet brush I&#x27;ve purchased! Lightweight and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. The color is nice too!</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing I highlighted my hair and it seemed impossible to brush it so I asked my fiend whatshe did she said she got a wet brush so I ordered this one and it&#x27;s a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> Works great on wet hair!  We replaced a Knot Genie with this and this works much better.  Doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s much different than similar brushes but works really well on our (fussy) daughters&#x27; hair.  No more yelling &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; when brushing.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist turned me onto this brush. I have long hair and no matter how much conditioner I use, it can get tangled easily. This brush goes through my hair like it&#x27;s butter. I never feel like my hair is being pulled from the roots. No more tears. No more cringes. Worth the price! Someone else left a review about a weird odor. I&#x27;ve never had a problem like that with my brush.</li>
    <li> You need this. If you are on the fence, don&#x27;t me. I have super tangly hair and hate brushing it. This has solved many a headache for me.</li>
    <li> I have to put leave in conditioner in my daughters hair to brush it so that she doesn&#x27;t feel all of the snarls.  I bought this brush because I wanted to see if I could omit the conditioned/detangler.  The good news is it does work good on wet hair.  However, I read that it worked well on dry hair too.  Not so much for us.  My daughter still complains about me pulling her hair.  So I use this for her out of the shower but use a brush for when her hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I love it for my extremely thick hair. I also have the as seen on tv brush but it doesn&#x27;t work half as well as this one. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. Though it&#x27;s just a brush, it is a SUPER brush. I give this 10,000 stars. I have very long hair and have yet to have this pull or yank at my head at all. Love love love.</li>
    <li> Great for brushing hair without pulling it out. Everyone who has used it has fallen in love and buys their own.</li>
    <li> No more crying or running away from the brush! My kids love this - it takes the tangle out so easily and quickly. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have two girls, aged 4.5 and 3 and every. single. day. I go through heck (hell&#x27;s a bit extreme, I guess) trying to brush their hair! The older one has fine hair that, for some reason, tangles into knots if there&#x27;s a mild breeze. The three year old&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t tangle much but her scalp must have been crafted out of nothing but the finest of gold leaf and nerve endings. She screeches the second a brush touches her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just opened up the brush and tried it out. The three year old didn&#x27;t FLINCH let alone whine or cry. The 4.5 year old brushed her hair all by herself and got rid of all the tangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why, oh why did I not know about this years ago?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear to Flying Spaghetti Monster, this is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for fine hair that tangles easily! And It comes in an assortment of colors too.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for my teenage daughters who use it on wet hair right after they shower! It goes through long hair smoothly. This is their 2nd &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; and will only use this kind on their hair. Highly recommend for girls with long hair!</li>
    <li> I bought 5 WET brushes for family. The girls and their parents love them! Even the guy loves his black brush.</li>
    <li> Overall good brush but let me tell you if you have thick hair this brush is not going through your hair! Mu daughter has super thick hair and this brush just goes over top layer but otherwise good brush just something to consider.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my two granddaughters! They and their moms love the brush.  Both have very long hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and it works.  it reminds me of the cat and dog brush thou</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! This works wonders on my hair. It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a fake. It says Wet Brush not to be confused,  as I was,  with The Wet Brush you get in stores.  It is not the same, it is stiff.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! My hair is thick, long, wavy, and always knotty when I get out of the shower. It is so hard to brush/comb and I always struggled. But now that I have this Wet Brush, it pushes right through those knots and easily and quickly brushes my hair. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve threatened to cut my daughters hair off for over a year because it gets so tangled. (i would never actually cut her hair off) This brush was a god send.</li>
    <li> My daughter still would whine &amp; cry in pain when i brushed her hair. Not a miricle worker like I was told it was. But it&#x27;s a fine basic brush.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that would take me forever to brush when it was wet. Then a hairstylist told me about the wet brush and it was ONE OF THE BEST BEAUTY PURCHASES I HAVE EVER MADE!! No joke. This thing is amazing - I was finally able to brush my hair easily and quickly, without losing handfuls of it every time. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I as a single dad love this brush!! I&#x27;m no master at doing my daughters hair. But this brush makes my life so much easier and I don&#x27;t hear anymore whining! That there is worth every penny!! I&#x27;m actually surprised this brush is as cheap as it is... No need for detangler!! I bought my daughter the ultimate detangling brush by Paul Revere or whatever its called for $25 and this My Wet Brush is 100 times better!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.. This is the brush you want dads!</li>
    <li> I was seriously skeptical about this brush working as well as everyone claimed it did... I am in awe! I have extremely long, thick, curly hair. It literally takes me 20mins to brush it by myself. If my husband brushes it for me, it takes at least 10mins. I tried this brush, and I was done in half the time AND it didn&#x27;t hurt! I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I felt this needed my praise. Like I said, I&#x27;m in complete awe. I will never buy another brush- I&#x27;m sticking with the My Wet Brush for life.</li>
    <li> I saw the wet brush advertised in a magazine about a year ago. I thought I&#x27;d order one to try out. OMG! It really works. It brushes thru wet hair like nobody&#x27;s business. I&#x27;ve bought 5 of them for my family and friends. I even bought a mini for me for my trip to Hawaii.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters have long hair and normally hate to brush it because of the pain--but this brush makes the experience so much more pleasant. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I wish I had heard of this when I was a little girl being raised by a single dad-lol. I have used my fair share of detangle spray as a little kid and it didn&#x27;t really work that well still.I can brush my long hair right out of the shower with it and it doesn&#x27;t pull on me or hurt at all. I was convinced to get this from my hairdresser after I noticed she could brush my hair in like 15 seconds while it was wet. This it the BEST BRUSH EVER!</li>
    <li> My favorite! I purchased two of these and will by again. It has ended the crying while brushing the hair!</li>
    <li> i love my wetbrush! my hair gets extremely tangled and this brush gets rid of the knots without hurting at all! i recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Had to get a second so each daughter could have her own!  Best brush I  found for my tender-headed girls!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, curly hair. This brush doesn&#x27;t make a dent in her tangles. It&#x27;s basically a pet brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 11 and has always hated brushing her hair because she has thick, ver wavy hair.  This really is a miracle brush.  Wet or dry, she can get all the way through it without me hurting her to finish the job.  We have several sizes for a travel/swim bag and or home.</li>
    <li> love this brush, bought two already, easy to brush tangles out of wet hair</li>
    <li> This is a great hair brush. The best I have ever used. It detangles with ease. Great color too.</li>
    <li> I have very long, fine hair that is prone to breakage. Detangling after a shower can take forever and be damaging. This brush is gentle enough to get out even the hardest snarls with little to no breakage. The smaller size is great for toting back and forth. Also great for small gifts! Works wonderful on both wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!  Works very well, and the price is right.  Detangled my hair very easily.  My hair seems to have more volume, too.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old (and I) just love this brush.  Its great for getting the knots out of both wet and dry hair.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have really thick long hair, along with an extremely tender head, so brushing out my hair isa very painful process. But after I started using the wet brush I could barely feel even the really snarly parts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I haven&#x27;t tried this while my hair is wet yet but based on my experience so far I am confident in the results.)</li>
    <li> Awesome for my daughters hair. No more battles after the bath. I even started using it for me own hair!</li>
    <li> I got my brush about two days ago and i must say that i like it a lot. It detangles my hair quickly and painless both wet or dry. The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because when i got the brush some of the bristles were bended other than that it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
    <li> GREAT brush!!  I got it because my hair stylist recommended it.  I used to have tons of hair on my brush on a daily basis.  This brush really has cut down on that.  I have also shared it with my friends who have children and they love that it doesn&#x27;t pull as much as other brushes.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I have very long hair (down to my lower back.) Brushing my hair after showering used to be a hassle. Trying to get all the knots out of my hair would be awful. I would lose a handful of hair every time I brushed my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, I found out about this brush one day when I was reading an article about Snooki&#x27;s hair. She said this brush was amazing, so I figured for the price, why not try it? And oh my gosh, I am so happy that I did! It brushes the knots right out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in the shower, right after conditioning and I guarantee you&#x27;ll never use another brush again. For example. I used it earlier today and I only lost maybe four strands of hair. You can absolutely also use it on dry hair. This is actually the second brush I&#x27;ve purchased, I got it for my mom because I had to make sure she had this amazing product! She has already asked me to order her another one.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I managed before discovering the wet brush. It is the best. I don&#x27;t know how or why it works, but I do not care. It makes it soooo easy and painless to brush out the tangles. Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on this one after 12 years of dealing with a tender-headed girl who hated to have her hair brushed. My daughter doubted this even more so. I can&#x27;t describe how excited that we found this small miracle. She doesn&#x27;t cringe when she brushes her hair and I finally can have fun braiding it and doing fun styles! Love it!</li>
    <li> miracle brush for curly/frizzy/tangly hair</li>
    <li> So so. Not what it&#x27;s cracked up to be. To much talk but the brush doesn&#x27;t have a lot of action.</li>
    <li> This thing saved me from hours of painful brushing. After having a baby&#x27;s naturally curly hair was dry and tangled so easily. No conditioner helped! Love this brush! I reccomend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> The only brush I use on my 4 year old&#x27;s curly, tangle-prone hair!  Gentle, yet effective.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this since March. I was very skeptical at first, but was willing to try it so morning hair brushing wouldn&#x27;t be WWII.  My daughter has very fine hair that tangles easily.  This hair brush makes brushing her hair a lot less painful.  It&#x27;s not 100% snag free.  But gone are the \\&quot;Mom, it hurts!\\&quot; comments from my kid.    Also, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice hair detangling spray, the Original Sprout Hair detangler works very well.  When I combine using the detangler with this brush, it&#x27;s very easy and pain-free!    It works so well that I just ordered another one!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thin, curly hair and until this brush getting through her hair was a nightmare. She can now brush all of her hair by herself, works awesome!</li>
    <li> I have a step daughter that has very fine hair so it get tangled, knotted easily. We tried many different brushes but all had the same outcome. They didn&#x27;t work and left her with tears in her eyes. Well I get the kids ready for school in the morning so I brush her hair (she&#x27;s 6). We have had this for about a month or so and no more crying or tears from her. It still pulls her hair on some parts but the brush still goes through. Doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all and that&#x27;s what we wanted. Now my fiancee uses it too lol. SO over all it does work great, not perfect but the best thing we have found, and that&#x27;s after spending a ton of wasted money on different brush styles, etc. I hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Best brush out there for getting tangles out of thick hair. Works very well on daughter&#x27;s fine hair also. We no longer need detangler spray! Pink color is very vibrant. Easier to spot than the generic gray wet brush, when daughter invariably leaves it lying around the house.....</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful brush for thick wet hair especially in summer time pool, lake use! It detangles well and does not break hair. I have several and will pack them for all weekend/vacation trips.</li>
    <li> I have super long, thick hair and I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I always brush my hair right out of the shower and with my old brush I would end up ripping clumps out - This Wet Brush works amazing- doesn&#x27;t hurt when I am working through knots, doesn&#x27;t rip clumps out and makes for smoother hair! I wish I found this brush sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair that tangles very easily.  It is so painless and brushes through her hair so easily.  She loves it and likes to brush her hair herself now.</li>
    <li> Very soft and good for kids.  Brushes well wet and dry hair, and even very fuzzy one.  Because it is very soft it does not massage the scalp, which might be an issue with adults.</li>
    <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I brush her hair.  This is the best product I have ever bought from Amazon.  Tearing my hair out I almost invested in a Mason Pearson.  What else can I say.  To me My Wet Brush is priceless.</li>
    <li> best brush ever. No more tears from my daughter. She has super tangly hair. She loves it. w\I have one for me as well</li>
    <li> I have 4 young girls with long hair and they all hate getting their hair brushed till I got the wet brush. They love this brush!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! This helps so much. Before I had so many tangles, and I cried when I brushed my hair because it hurt.  Now that I have this brush, I smile during brush time.  We now own two because my mom wants to use it too.</li>
    <li> The longer my hair grew, the more unmanageable it became, until I thought I would have to cut it to solve the problem of huge tangles forming.  I had tried wide toothed combs, conditioners, detangling sprays, and oils to help loosen and prevent tangles and they would still form.  I would cringe at the thought of having to brush my hair and frequently ended up ripping at tangles and pulling out huge clumps of hair.  Well, all of that changed when I received The Wet Brush for Christmas 2014.  Let me tell you, this brush is a game changer.  Using it is like brushing my hair with an angel&#x27;s wing and I am almost certain I can hear a hallelujah chorus singing in the background.  Not only does it make brushing and detangling my hair virtually effortless, but I feel like my hair is smoother and softer to the touch.  I also noticed a reduction in hair lost while brushing.  Previously, I could have knitted a sweater out of the hair left in my brush.  My dream is to have a Wet Brush for every room in my house so one is never too far from reach.</li>
    <li> Great for brushing through wet hair without pulling it out!</li>
    <li> Have been using these brushes for a few years now, as do my two twenty something year old daughters. We love em. Feel great on scalp. Amazing at detangling thick hair, which we all three have. Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> It was everything it said it was suppose to be.</li>
    <li> I use this as my main brush (on my hair when dry) and it is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of knots without pulling/ripping hair.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and this is the best thing I have ever used buy it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> We have three daughters, and we have now purchased 3 of these brushes.  I even use one myself and have found a reduction in hair breakage compared to my old brush.  They are wonderful for brushing out tangled hair.  So much fewer screams and whines in this house since finding these!</li>
    <li> The only detangle brush that works. Get it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 7 and has recently begun to do her own hair. We bought her this brush after seeing a commercial for a different brush. When we came to Amazon to purchase the other brush, the reviews on it weren&#x27;t consistently good. There was a link to this brush and it had better reviews so we bought it.  It arrived quickly and my daughter loves it. She can brush her hair easily and there is virtually no pain when it gets through the knots.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for a little girl. She likes it. It takes the tangles out and she can brush her own hair</li>
    <li> I will never use another brush again.  This is Awesome for kids.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my toddler-aged daughter whose hair can get really matted.  First week of use, I was thinking \\&quot;This works pretty well, but it&#x27;s not magic.  By the second week, \\&quot;Okay, it&#x27;s magic.\\&quot;  It really is the best brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works great for untangling wet hair!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind trying it out for the price, this brush really works detangling your hair especially after you&#x27;ve showered.  With other brushes I pull my hair out,  the knots hurt but this brush you just brush it out so easy and with less time.  It even leaves my hair soft.  I usually put a lot of conditioner to make the process easier but with my new brush that&#x27;s all I need!  I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends about it.  The brush looks so simple just like the rest but it does the job without pain.  I have long thick hair and tangles very easy so I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Loved it bristles falling out</li>
    <li> Bought this for my gf for Christmas, she literally has not stopped praising me for it since. She has long, thick hair that she uses all sorts of sprays and cremes and gels and goos on, when she gets home at the end of a long day, she is able to pull this brush through whatever garbage she&#x27;s thown into her hair that morning without pain. Gentlemen, if you want to stay in a relationship and keep being a cheapass (as I do), buy this for your girl. She will continuously thank you with gifts of sandwiches and sexual favors, possibly simultaneously!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush. Love the feel of it. Definately feels better brushing out wet hair with this brush rather a regular brush. Will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> Great brush. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t matter how tangled your hair is, with this brush you can easily brush your hair with no pain. I love taking this brush to the beach so after I go swimming I can easily brush my hair when I get out of the water.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, no more tangles. Can be used with both wet and dry hair. Definitely recommend to all hair lengths, women and children.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush everyone should own one!</li>
    <li> Detangles my curly hair without breaking it! I am obsessed! I bought two more for my mom and sister.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my Yorkie Dog.  It works great for brushing without pulling her hair.  I know it wasn&#x27;t designed with pets in mind so the head is a little large for brushing around her face and eyes but it works much better than the harsh pet brushes.</li>
    <li> First brush that does not hurt my girls hairs..... My oldest daughter says that \\&quot;I have thick hair and with the wet brush my hair is now smooth.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I did not expect this brush to work as well as some of the reviews stated. I must say that it exceeded my expectations. I got one for my wife and one for my daughter. They both have hair that is wavy and about medium thickness. When used right after a shower, I have not seen a brush that does a quicker or more painless job of getting rid of tangles. Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Expected it to work better on my dry hair, will test it out on my wet hair soon.</li>
    <li> It works better than an ordinary dry brush, but it still gets stuck in my hair and I still end up pulling clumps of hair out of the brush.  My hair is thick and wavy (curly when wet), but not super unmanageable so I&#x27;m surprised the brush didn&#x27;t work better!</li>
    <li> Works great to detangle my daughters fine hair without tears and hair breakage.  Great price.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush! I haven&#x27;t used a brush in my hair in over 30 years! Wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without this one!!!</li>
    <li> It is a regular brush that doesn&#x27;t do anything special, it hurts to brush on a wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Okay, my hairdresser told me about this product and swears it is OKAY to now brush my hair when wet, at least with THIS brush.  I am amazed at how easy my hair is untangled.  I always have an issue with tangles.  I would highly recommend this product and you can not beat the price.</li>
    <li> love the color but its very scratchy on the scalp. It doesn&#x27;t seem special from any other brush but I only just got it today. It brushed through my hair nice tho. But need to be gentle with it so you don&#x27;t scratch your scalp bad but would be great if your head is itchy :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update I used it again on my dry hair now and its super gentle not scratchy so maybe its a little scratchy on a wet scalp but I still don&#x27;t think its special just a regular brush I like it as much as my 5 dollar brush but this one is a better color and not as beat up :p</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this in a salon store for $4 but it really works for girls that cry when getting hair brushed!  Plus my daughter loves that it is pink.  :)</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I know about this when my hair was long !!  This is fantastic - if you haven&#x27;t got one of these - BIG MISTAKE !!  It is great on your scalp and DOES NOT break your hair - and my hair is fine but I have a lot of it so it tangles easy - I am surprised at how well it goes through the hair and does not damage it.  This will not be my last one - for sure !  Definitely recommend - and it came as promised exactly the way it was shown...</li>
    <li> AMAZING brush!! For wet or dry hair. My daughter has frizzy hair and this is the only brush that works and doesn&#x27;t make it look wild</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great service!</li>
    <li> Good brush especially with wet hair. I got it for my daughter but I use it sometimes too!</li>
    <li> Great brush for long hair, makes a shower even more enjoyable now that I can get thru my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush works great on my tender headed child!</li>
    <li> First, I want to say that I was skeptical about this brush.  I mean, it just looks like a regular brush.  Worse than that, it looks like one of those cheap brushes where the bottoms of the bristles grab and yank your hair while you&#x27;re brushing.  Man, I hate those brushes.  However, brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is a nightmare.  She has long, thin, fine hair that tangles easily, and her &#x27;detangling&#x27; brush now had bent bristles.  I kept hearing about the Wet Brush, and I knew moms who swore by it, so I was amazed when I saw it.  I mean, see above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I still thought it looked like nothing special, but I decided to try it.  The next time my daughter came downstairs with her hair in knots, I pulled out the new brush and started brushing.  I winced as soon as I heard that tearing, tangled sound - but my daughter didn&#x27;t.  I brushed a few more times, not a peep from her - normally, she&#x27;s saying &#x27;ow&#x27; and whimpering by now.  So I stopped and asked her if it hurt, and she said no.  Not at all?  Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound I was hearing wasn&#x27;t her hair, it was the bristles bending and giving way.  And the worry I had about the bristles grabbing her hair?  Turned out that the bristles aren&#x27;t attached to the cushion, they&#x27;re poking up through it - so the bottoms don&#x27;t have anything to pinch with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I was wrong.  This is a great brush, and now I own one, too.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly and often tangled hair; especially in the morning before school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush seems to fit the bill in going through the tangled mess with relative ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, she loves the color. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> my daughter needed a brush, saw this on pinterest so i bought it. I grew up with a &amp;#34;tough head&amp;#34; and never really thought it was a big deal to comb my hair and have it pull so much. I have tried this brush and it is AMAZING! I have to use it all the time now. It brushes like a dream.</li>
    <li> I hated brushing my hair after when I get out of the shower because my hair knots like crazy but this brush helps me so much! The only problem i had was it wouldn&#x27;t get a knot out of my hair it would just brush over it. so it works most the time ;)</li>
    <li> only brush for my daughters long curly hair- doesn&#x27;t hurt and she loves to brush it as well. - great</li>
    <li> goes through wet hair easily.  much better than a wide tooth comb.  less hair loss and faster to get knots out.  this is the only brush i now use.  have given it to 2 people and they also love it.</li>
    <li> This brushes were delivered in less than 24 hours. They are fantastic value and perfect for my 11 year old. In fact I bought 3 large wet brushes to have around our house as they seem to always go missing! I also purchased a mini version for my daughters school bag! Well worth the money and in great colours!</li>
    <li> I have these all over my house since I have 3 girls. Best hair brush out their for little girls!</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used on my daughters knotty hair. Can not explian how SUPER this brush is. I was surprised by the shipping and how fast I recieved it</li>
    <li> A very good hair accessory to help teenagers do their tangled hair with no pain. You cannot find it elsewhere</li>
    <li> Great for thick curly wet hair, not more OUCH!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. My kids use to cry when getting there hair brushed (1 straight &amp; 1 curly). No more tears and hair is soft. I use it because I have extensions and it keeps my hair soft while not pulling on the extensions.</li>
    <li> WARNING:  I did not receive the Wet Brush in this picture - it was a knock off.  I have the real The &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; and it has a different logo and the shade is different.</li>
    <li> This brush really lives up to it&#x27;s name.  My daughter has curly hair and this is the problem solver I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush! I have long, thick hair &amp; this never pulls my hair. I only collect 20% of the hair in the wet brush that I do in a normal brush. I will never go back to a regular brush--this is great on wet &amp; dry hair!</li>
    <li> this is a miracle brush.  our daughter has very long, fine, thin hair.  she loves her hair to be &amp;#34;long and flowing.&amp;#34;  but she hates having her hair brushed, so it tangles and knots like crazy.  hair brushing sessions ended in tears, and fights.&lt;br /&gt;  enter the wet brush.  ANGELS SING.  it is fantastic.  LOVE IT.  If your child hates having their hair brushed get this brush.  it works beautifully on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;  our teething puppy got a hold of it, so i may have to buy a new brush, but it is so good,t hat I won&#x27;t feel too bad at all about buying another brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. This was my second one. My other one lasted about 5 years. Won&#x27;t buy another brush ever! This was is great!!!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! This brush is amazing! I have such thick long hair that I want to either cry or cut it out every time its washed. Not anymore all because of this brush! It goes through my hair like butter and I don&#x27;t feel pain and it no longer takes me 10min just to brush my hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is every thing the reviews say and more!  My daughter has very thick &amp; curly hair and we were having trouble with knots in her hair.  She would cry when it came time to brush her hair, but no longer!  We love this brush so much and I even ordered one for my niece who hated brushing her hair due to knots and now she loves to brush her hair, this brush is a true miracle!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Moroccanoil paddle brush for years but recently found my hair extra difficult to brush and didn&#x27;t want to suffer through knots anymore. I have very thin sleek Asian hair so it&#x27;s not a lot to deal with but it can get very tangled. I heard so many good things about Wet Brush and its similar competitors so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - YES it does work! The brush bristles are VERY flexible hence its ease in going through your hair. It feels soft and gentle and initially you may think that its just brushing the surface and that its not actually getting through your hair, but it is. I like that it feels softer than other brushes I have but I still occasionally use a second brush to go through my hair after the Wet Brush just because I am used to that tug and extra reassurance my hair is combed thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: It is not a miracle brush where you won&#x27;t have any tough spots or pulls - I still have tangles and have to run the brush through a few spots multiple times but what makes it so great is that its A LOT easier compared to other brushes out there. And yes, the brush does pull out my hair still but at least it&#x27;s very gentle!</li>
    <li> My family 8, all competitive swimmers, have amongst us 6 females.  The girls LOVE these brushes so much people steal them.  We buy them as gifts and become stars for finding the best brush ever!  We probably have 10 of them around the house, in the swim backpacks and in our vehicles.  Great product, great price and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s really long hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter totally loved this brush (she has very thick coarse hair that tangles quite easily) - it really works!!!</li>
    <li> my mother in law told me about this brush.  It works great.  Both my daughter and I each have one.</li>
    <li> This is literally the ONLY thing that will detangle my hair after a shower. Before this brush came into my life I tried detangling sprays, wide toothed combs, tangle teasers -- NOTHING has worked as well as this did. When I first got it, I decided to test it out by trying to comb through my hair mask in the shower, something I have never been able to do. The brush literally combed through my hair like silk. I have no idea why or how it works so well but I am beyond happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything special about this brush so I was a bit disappointed. My expectations were based on the reviews.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my hair. I usually have to clean my brush out once a week from hair and 3 weeks with this brush and there is barely any hair caught in it! My friend used it once and immediately went on to amazon and bought one for herself and one for her sister. Buy it! It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have a 6 year old that LOVES this brush.</li>
    <li> perfect for wet hair!</li>
    <li> Finally can brush my daughters&#x27; hair without tears and tantrums, they love it, i love, great colors too, fast shipment</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST brush for kids ever! My kids always complained about brushing, but this brush ended all the fuss. The knots are worked out easily, without pain, without extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t often say this about products I buy, but this made my life easier. I know, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just a brush&amp;#34; but here, THIS brush is a very big deal that makes life as a mom better.</li>
    <li> Fab brush! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> For those hard to brush heads or sensitive children who don&#x27;t like their hair brushed, this brush is the kne for you.  Carefully untangles as it brushes through the hair without the pulling and discomfort of a regular brush.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Both of my girls love this brush and won&#x27;t use any others now. Very pleased with how it de-tangles.</li>
    <li> Works great in wet hair, but not on dry.  Many of the reviews said it worked as a detangling brush o dry hair too but that was not our experience.  I am giving it five stars because it does what it says it will...detangles wet hair easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this brush is amazing!  it easily glides thru wet hair and doesn&#x27;t tangle at all or pull like other brushes.  I bought it because I have a young daughter and figured I would eventually need it, but ended up using it myself!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  My daughters didn&#x27;t complain at all.  I can finally run my fingers through their hair!  Now I won&#x27;t dread brushing their hair.</li>
    <li> This does what it says. Very easy on the scalp and drying our daughters hair has never been easier. Please buy it!</li>
    <li> I first bought for my daughter- AMAZING. No more tears &amp; fights about brushing her hair. It is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. After we were so thrilled with the brush, I ordered them for every girl &amp; lady we know as Christmas gifts. So far I think total we have purchased 7 wet brushes. Highly, highly rec. this product.</li>
    <li> after watching and reading reviews of this product i finally decided i needed this brush in my life. when i first tested it out after shampooing my hair, i was so mind blown. how could a brush be so magical at detangling? what is this sorcery? if you have tangly hair, i recommend this product 1000% to you. it will change your life.</li>
    <li> My kids still cry and whine when I brush their hair, but not as much.  Hoped this would be a magical cure.  Still the best brush we have though.</li>
    <li> It looks like a normal brush.  They say that there is something special about the bristles, but I was skeptical.  Then I tried it.  I leave less hair in the brush.  Tangles come free.  My waves look great.  My daughter&#x27;s curls look better than ever.  I bought one for each female in my family!</li>
    <li> the bristles came off the first time i laid that brush on my hair. it just continued to shed...i have about 60% of bristles left. total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! My toddler loves it!</li>
    <li> Never brush your toddler girl&#x27;s hair without a wet brush.  No more tears!!!!  This brush has made getting out the door in the morning a MUCH easier process.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!  I lost mine for 2 days and had to use a normal brush on my wet hair and it was a disaster.  Hurt so bad, so many snarls and tears...then I ordered my new wet brush from Amazon and everything is great again ;)  Works on tough shower knots, works on any knots and doesnt hurt or tear at-all.  Every woman needs one and every mother with a little girl needs one too!</li>
    <li> This brushed changed my life, and I&#x27;m not joking at all. It is AMAZING. I have very VERY thick tangly hair and I used to hate having to brush it because it hurt so badly. This brush does not hurt AT ALL. I am so thankful that I have it. It is truly amazing</li>
    <li> The only brush that actually brushes my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Works quite well to de tangle wet or dry hair</li>
    <li> Great brushMy hair tangles easily and I love using this brush because it leaves it Philly nice and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to pull it through my wet tangled hair after shower</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice fragile brush but I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s still a bit damaging when I use it on my wet hair. It&#x27;s just a softer bristle brush, they marketed the idea well.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush! My daughter and I use it every day. It is well worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my daughter but use it as much myself. It is great and really doesn&#x27;t hurt when brushing wet hair. My only complaint is the color sent doesn&#x27;t match the description/picture. It was the more pearl pink or purple color instead of the bright pink gloss color I thought I was getting. But color doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the brush so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. My daughter has very curly hair. This brush goes right through the curls. There is less screaming and crying now.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this brush a try after reading all of the (mostly) positive reviews. It definitely lives up to its promise to gently detangle wet hair. I have straight, thick long hair that was showing signs of breakage. Despite always using conditioner, I was consistently cleaning out an alarmingly large amount of hair out of my brush after each shower. This brush does an awesome job of gently detangling my wet hair without pulling or snapping my strands. I counted less than ten hairs left in the brush after the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, I do have two complaints. The major one is the smell. The brush has a VERY strong plastic/chemical smell. It temporarily leaves my hair smelling like the chemical odor, but luckily this seems to be temporary. I&#x27;m really hoping the smell will go away over time. Also, I live in a very dry climate (Colorado), and I can&#x27;t use this brush on dry hair. It leaves my hair standing on end with static.</li>
    <li> I gave this brush 5 stars because it really does brush through your hair wet and tangly without pulling your hair out!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!!  I no longer have to chase my daughters around the house to brush their hair!!  It really does work better than your average brush.  It gets knots and tangles out in a jiffy, even without the use of a detangler.  I will be buying more of them.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. Changed our lives. There is no more screaming when brushing hair after bath. You  must use it wet.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long and wavy hair that tangles easily.  This brush will eventually get the tangles out, and probably less painfully than the average brush.  One positive thing I have noted is even with daily use, there have been no broken bristles, or bristles that come out of the brush.  Because of that I would say this brush is better than average, but don&#x27;t expect it to just glide through tangled hair.</li>
    <li> 1. good buy. 2. saves time brushing hair. 3. good detangler.4. carry with me everywhere.5. love it more than my mason pearson brush</li>
    <li> We LOVE these brushes!!!  My girls hate getting their hair brushed but will not only let me brush their hair, they will brush it themselves!!!</li>
    <li> The brush feels AMAZING in my scalp!  This fabulous brush was also delivered two days ahead of the projected day. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This brush is a miracle for getting tangles out after a bath.  The brush does not work well when the hair is dry, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called the Wet Brush. I would highly recommend this product, especially to parents of kids who do not like to have their hair brushed.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why but this brush is not as good as the mini of the same brand.  It works but I did not feel that it stops the hair from being pulled.  I recommend getting The Wet Brush mini.</li>
    <li> I own 3. I love these. I find that they are easier on my daughter&#x27;s tangles, so we are always reaching for one (over the rest of the brushes we have). Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair brush. Does a great job untangling hair wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Didnt make it easier to brush my daughters hair but still a nice brush.</li>
    <li> Love love this brush. I have very long hair, tangles easy, and this brush goes right thru and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out. Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I dreaded thinking about brushing my long hair when it was wet. The brush feels great on my hair, detangles easily, and is soft on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I have several of these now and while one does get the occasional snag, brushing is no longer a horrendous nightmare either for me or for the youths. Works wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Believe the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; (we believed that it was mostly hype until tried it ourselves).</li>
    <li> I very soft and its a real detangler</li>
    <li> Seriously, my dd and I would fight EVERY day about brushing her hair because her scalp is so sensitive. I actually was buying the $25 Paul Mitchell paddle brushes because it was the best I could find at not pulling.  But I just bought like 5 of these as I am now using it too! And they are way cheaper! The bristles are flexible, I guess so that they don&#x27;t pull when your hair is wet ie wet brush. 😉 I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else in her quite frankly because I have probably already tried it- I should have a hair brush sale! The small roundish ones that have the different length bristles- supposed to be no tangles- didn&#x27;t work.  None of the many &amp;#34;great for tangles&amp;#34; brushes I bought worked - they all hurt her head. Soooo much happier now!</li>
    <li> This seriously is the best and only hair brush you&#x27;ll ever need. I don&#x27;t know what makes it so smooth and tag free bc it looks like an ordinary hair brush however it is anything but! Buy the brush!</li>
    <li> Works better than similar products out in the market. I wet it with warm water and then brush which makes it easier.</li>
    <li> Who knew I&#x27;d be writing a review for a brush lol... I just got it yesterday so no clue how it works on wet hair, but its awesome on dry hair. So freaken soft!!!! Getting my tangles out on my long wavy hair was a breeze. I usually use a wide tooth comb (never a brush) to detangle my hair (wer or dry) so this was great and hopefully it will stay soft and nothing changes cause the wide tooth comb will never touch my dry hair again.... This brush felt so soft and so good on the scalp I brushed literally for almost 5 minutes. Fingers crossed it works on wet hair, but 5 stars for dry hair for sure :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. No funky smell in my pink brush, no scent at all.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who forgot to bring hers on a trip back home.  She swears by it and she knows.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is really comfortable in your hand and it brushes effortlessly through the tangles in my long hair, wet or dry. I definitely had reservations, as my hair is notoriously knotty after a shower, but this brush does everything it promises. It is an excellent value at this price. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair, brushing has always been such a pain. But with the wet brush, it&#x27;s so much easier. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for wet hair ever. Glides through tangles with ease and no pulling. There are only 4 stars due to how it works with dry hair.</li>
    <li> Helped me detangle my daughters hair!</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing. No more broken hair pieces in the sink. Even the worst of tangles are no problem. Would purchase more.</li>
    <li> My girls and wife love these.</li>
    <li> I never thought that buying a brush for under $10 would make such a difference, but wow. When you brush wet hair virtually nothing tears out, and it works wonders for managing split ends. Buy 1, buy 4, I swear---you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> i have an issue with breakage and must brush my hair while wet because of all the products I use that would dry weird if I didn&#x27;t. I bought this brush and seriously have almost 0 hair loss now when brushing. I have had this brush a LOOOONG time and have never had to clean it out. I use it for drying and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one for my bf and mini one for the kids who would cry and try to hide when we would want to brush their hair. I told them this is a magic brush that never hurts and turns their hair to silk. They now want their hair brushed! they never cry out or wince because these just slide through tangles as long as you go slow and don&#x27;t yank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with these brushes I will probably buy some and give them as gifts. The mini one is perfect for travel and purses too!! The colors are even great. I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Really does work great on wet hair</li>
    <li> This brush is great! I have very damaged hair, but since i&#x27;ve been using this brush, my hair looks healthier than ever!:) And as a highschool student, I don&#x27;t have time to worry about bad hair between projects, essays, reports, and homework lol. This brush is simply perfect</li>
    <li> I have long hair. It used to take me a long time to brush out my hair after getting good out of the shower... I also had to put oil in my hair to prevent tangling. Now, I don&#x27;t use the oil and it takes me half the amount of time that it used to without the wet brush!</li>
    <li> The best thing since sliced bread!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about all my hair being pulled out as this brush slides through it all with ease.  My only complaint? It&#x27;s not the best for putting your hair up in a tight ponytail but definitely worth it if your hair is tough to get through wet or dry!</li>
    <li> Had bought before the less fancy one, worked way much better... Pretty much no pain... But this one hurts the brush it has at the bottom gets stuck on the hair and hurts, I went back to buying the simpler version and a small one for my daughter, love those!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always lovely to discover  a product that lives up to the raves, and this one does. I have thick, coarse, unmanageable (Indian) hair and this works as advertised - detangles both wet and dry. Leaves hair silky,soft and shiny when used on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Works wonders!! My daughter has curly, knotty hair and brushing her hair is awful! But this wet brush makes it so much easier and less painful for her!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long....LONG hair. This brush has saved our mornings getting ready for school!</li>
    <li> the BOMBEST for sensitive heads!</li>
    <li> A must for curly girls!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. Very glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I love my brush. Works well in wet or dry hair. My daughter and I both have waist length hair and it really help with knots and snags</li>
    <li> love love love this brush.  my hair gets very tangled in the shower, this brush works wonders</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing brush. My daughter has thick curly hair that took forever to brush and I&#x27;d always pull a tangle that would make her cry. With this brush, she can brush her own hair with no issues.</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly hair and I found that using this brush when my hair was wet was a lot of work to get all of the tangles out.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and it really comb well with my splits... I love the colour of this brush...</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re not quite screaming free, but I think that&#x27;s only due to the fact that we&#x27;re so used to screaming when our hair is brushed. My kiddo has severe tangles, wet or dry hair. This brush with a little detangler works like a charm.</li>
    <li> A good product but not as super as described... my 6 year old granddaughter still had snarls and tangles that were hard to remove.</li>
    <li> What a life saver my daughter and I both have long hair that tangles and knots easily this brush works fast! Love it</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!!  I wish this was not an add-on product, but rather a regularly featured item.  This &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; policy drives me nuts.</li>
    <li> These have worked brilliantly for all of our kids... All of them have hair that knots up really easily, and my toddlers with their curly hair develop dreds after only one night of sleep. These brushes get through the dreads with no tears. and save me a lot of headache.</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine blonde hair and brushing it has always been an issue.  This brush allows me/her to brush her hair with hardly any complaint!  I love it.  So glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Just like my other one. great brush.. dog ate the 1st one.</li>
    <li> This brush lives up to our expectations.  My daughter has super curly hair &amp; she&#x27;s loving how soft &amp; shines it makes her hair.</li>
    <li> Much more gentle, but I would recommend a second stiffer brush to remove bad knots.</li>
    <li> awesome brush great price</li>
    <li> So far for my hair it&#x27;s fine, just below shoulder length.  I bought this for my daughter with long fine hair, and we&#x27;ll see if it holds to that test.  My only issue with the packaging was beat up, and some of the tines on the end were smashed form that packaging issue and are bent down in the wrong direction now.  I can&#x27;t fix that.</li>
    <li> The best brush around for long curly hair. Since using this my granddaughters won&#x27;t let me touch their hair with anything else. It really does work for tear-free brushing, even when their hair is very tangled. I can&#x27;t say enough about this great product.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my daughters hair and she loves it and I do too. It brushes right through.. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!! Glides through my long hair with ease!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush after recommendations from a friend.  My daughter has long, extremely thick hair that tangles easily.  This brush goes through her hair with ease.  No more crying or fussing because it hurts to have her hair brushed.  I am going to order more of these for us and for gifts.  Love this brush!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and I can see why. It works great!</li>
    <li> My 13-year old nice has some of thickess hair on earth and usually hates brushing her hair but when I gave this brush to her as a gift, she was transformed!! She loves it and bring the brush everywhere!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use mostly on dry hair, it never pulls, and is great with knots. The plastic bristles are soft and flexible. I usually use a comb on my wet hair as not to break the hair, but i find that because this brush is so delicate with my hair, it can definetly be used on wet hair with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush to use on my wet hair. It easily gets tangles out without breaking my long, fine hair. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, I was skeptical trying to decide if this was better or worse than brushing wet hair with a wide tooth comb. I was worried that this pulled out more hair and encouraged breakage. As it turns out this pulls my hair out LESS than my comb and it&#x27;s much faster and pulls less than my comb does on wet hair. This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. and I wont go back to any other brush. The pink color is a hot pink not a light baby pink color. I wish they made it in a light baby pink color. LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair.  She doesn&#x27;t whine or cry anymore when I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> This brush has saved my daughters long hair- I was threatening to cut it short because of the tangles and her reluctance to do simple brushing. Now, she hunts this brush down every morning, and does it herself without whining, screaming or yelling. We&#x27;ve now bought two, and the two year old with curly hair love it equally as much as the eight year old. The tangles simply fall out with this brush. I cannot say enough nice things about this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used. I have very fine hair that&#x27;s been bleached and is a pain to comb after showers and many times my hair is being ripped out. I have used so many different types of combs and they all hurt and rip my hair out just to get it kind of detangled. This brush blows them all out of the water. I barely lose any hair, it&#x27;s painless and I&#x27;ll never buy a different brush again. I love this brush so much.</li>
    <li> gets out tangles.. leaves hair frizzy.  totally unimpressed</li>
    <li> Best hair brush for knotty hair!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this brush!  Detangles my daughters hair wet or dry without pulling it out or her screaming!</li>

    <li> Works really great on wet and dry hair. The hot pink color is really cute, too! I have thick hair and it has cut down my morning, after shower hair brushing by a significant amount of time! Love it! Going to buy one for all of my friends!</li>
