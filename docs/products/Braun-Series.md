<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this product in the mail very quickly after ordering it from Braun.  I was so amazed at how easy it was to order this shaver on their web page.  I immediately charged the shaver and tried it out the same day.  What a difference it was from my other electric shaver.  I love the closeness it provided after the shave, and then the clean-up was amazing.  I recommend you check this out as it is a game changer for me!!</li>
    <li> For the last 10 years or so, I have used nothing but a straight razor.  But when I saw that I could get this electric shaver for free from Braun &amp; Bzzagent, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  So far, it is one of the best electric shavers that I have used.  In the past, electric shavers seemed to give me more razor burn than regular razors, but the 5090 has been great so far.  I still probably prefer the regular blades, but if you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an older Braun series 5 shaver.  The styling is nicer on this model. The power cable is improved. The older one had a metal band on the outside of the plug that made contact with the shaver (that&#x27;s what broke on my older one). I don&#x27;t see this cable ever breaking.  At first it didn&#x27;t shave as close as the older model, but after a few weeks it is getting better.  My skin had to get used to the new razor.  It is the same when I go from Braun to a Norelco.  My face gets rashy but after using it for awhile, my skin gets used to it.</li>
    <li> This was a splurge for me; typically I won&#x27;t spend more than $75 for an electric shaver.  I have to say that the difference is noticeable from my old Norelco. This provides a much closer shave and the device has a nice feel to it. Since I normally tap the shaver out after each use I only put it into the cleaner about once every two weeks and close up the cleaning solution after each use to prevent evaporation. If you are an old budget curmudgeon like me go ahead a have a little splurge on this model when it goes on sale again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/8/16: I have had this shaver for about a year and a half now and it is still going like a champ. No issues at all. Based on how I use the cleaner, each container of solution is lasting about 7 months. I would be happy to buy this again.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used Braun razors and have been completely happy with them. A few months ago my old Braun bit the dust and I purchased a Norelco.....big mistake. I wasn&#x27;t happy from the start with the closeness of the shave compared to the old Braun. The Braun is a big step up from the Norelco and even my old Braun. The Braun Series 5 runs at a higher speed than some other older Brains and even some newer ones. If you&#x27;ve owned a Braun before, you&#x27;re already familiar with the cleaning system, that hasn&#x27;t changed. Those neck hairs that have always given me problems are no problem at all for the Braun. One thing I do think Braun missed the boat on is the missing clear plastic foil protective cap. I confirmed with Braun via email and phone call that there is no protective cap for this model razor. The cap isn&#x27;t shown or mentioned in the instruction booklet so I guess they decided it was unneeded.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good solid feeling razor and you can expect it to give years of close shaves provided you change the head when it gets dull.  Which reminds me, you can&#x27;t replace just the cutters or head, you have to replace the entire head assembly. Be prepared to spend more when it does get dull or damaged.</li>
    <li> This shaver was (is) for my son, who says that it&#x27;s the best-ever shaver that he has owned during his 43-year life (not shaving all that time, though...).  I guess, that statement gets me to more-and-more thinking of switching from my old (same brand) to this newer model.  Reliable brand and even Made in Germany-quality, not made somewhere else as is so common nowadays.</li>
    <li> Generally satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;If you buy again Im going to buy the 9 series</li>
    <li> I bought this razor at Target, much to my dismay because if it had been Amazon I would have returned it already or not have been upsold on this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor simply does not give an even shave. There are several spots that I would go over in every which way, with the head of the razor locked or unlocked, that just would not shave. I was on a trip and all I wanted was to even up my beardline and get rid of the loose hairs on my cheek, and it couldn&#x27;t do either of those right. I remember going over my neck at least a dozen–dozen!–times trying to get all these patches shaved. If there&#x27;s one paltry good thing I can say about this razor, it&#x27;s that it made it two weeks on a trip without being plugged in once. Other than that, it&#x27;s a no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the stupid cleaning stand? It&#x27;s just an excuse to raise the price $100 more than you should be spending on a razor. Not only that, but the thing leaks like crazy. I lift it straight up to clean and it leaks the alcohol solution. I put the lid on the alcohol solution to take it back to Target, but the lid popped off and it leaked all over the box!!! Almost completely destroyed the receipt. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to return this.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 Electric Razor, from Braun, to try.  I was looking forward to trying the Braun Series 5, because I had not tried a Braun razor before and I had heard good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my Braun Series 5 razor, I was curious as to if there was a trimmer attached and I was also curious as to if it was cordless or not.  As I looked over the box, I noticed right away that it did have a trimmer attached!  Awesome!  After looking a bit more, I saw that it was also cordless (or corded, if preferred).  I had my answers and I was eager to open this box up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon pulling the Braun Series 5 razor out of the box, I noticed right away that it felt very good in my hand.  It felt like it was a quality made razor and the shape was comfortable in my hand.  I needed to charge it before use, so I plugged it in.  It seemed to charge very quickly (quick note: the charge lasts a long time!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use, I noticed that this was no ordinary razor.  The Braun Series 5 just felt better on my face than other razors I had tried in the past.  It seemed to glide over my face, it got rid of my stubble quickly (no going over and over to get it all) and the trimmer worked perfectly on my sideburns and the sensitive areas around my mouth/nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I mentioned sensitive areas, I should add that my face is sensitive to shaving.  With the Braun Series 5, my sensitive skin seemed to go away.  I&#x27;m not saying it did go away, I&#x27;m just saying that I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity with the Braun Series 5 razor.  That was a nice addition I wasn&#x27;t expecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 5 razor for a couple weeks now, and I have to say I won&#x27;t go back to any other brand.  I can really feel the difference in quality, compared to other brands I have used in the past.  My wife says I have a &#x27;super smooth&#x27; face now (her words, not mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel very comfortable recommending the Braun Series 5 razor to anyone that is interested in purchasing a new razor.  This would be a great gift or just upgrade from your current razor to the Braun Series 5.  I assure you that you won&#x27;t regret making the switch!  Don&#x27;t wait, get out there and get your razor today!that is interested in purchasing a new razor.  This would be a great gift or just upgrade from your current razor to the Braun Series 5.

    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090 for free to review and it is a nice electric shaver. I have been a razor blade user for a long time and have not used an electric shaver since 1992. My skin is sensitive and electric shavers tend to irritate my skin so that is why I gave up on them many years ago. While this Braun 5090 shaver does a good job on most of my face, I did not find it to get a clean and gentle shave on my neck. To get a good close shave on my neck, I wound up irritating my skin which left it feeling quite raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning and charging station is a great feature. I also like the trimmer that can get the side burns and keep them looking clean but I would not be ready to abandon my razor blade just yet. I would recommend this Braun shaver for people who need to touch up in the middle of the day or to those people who do  not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works okay on stubble that is more than one day old but horrible on an everyday basis!</li>
    <li> This razor is not necessarily bad but it does not work for me. I had to go over the same spot several times to get a little patch of hair off. When I was finished my face felt a little weird . Like I cut myself but there were no cuts. My old razor works way better and is cheaper. I would recommend looking into the Wahl razor. Braun was a good sport about refunding me however so I&#x27;d recommend at least trying it.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Previously, I had only used and electric or battery powered shaver once in my life.  From that one experience, I felt that an electric shaver could not give me the truly smooth and clean-cut shave that a standard razor provides.  However, since purchasing the Braun Series 5, I have completely changed my view.  This shaver is simple and comfortable to use and gives me the same shave I get from the razors that I have probably spent thousands of dollars buying replacement blades for over the years.  The edging feature also makes grooming my long side-burns really easy.  Furthermore, the cleaning-and-charging station makes maintaining and charging the shaver effortless.  I highly recommend the Braun Series 5!</li>
    <li> Great razor, but the clippers suck!</li>
    <li> I received this product from Braun free of charge to test and review. I currently own a series 7 Braun shaver so I was excited to compare the difference between the two. This shaver is sleek and stylish and its comfortable to hold. I wanted to do a side by side test so I let my facial hair grow to a length slightly more then stubble, I then used the series 5 shaver on one side and the series 7 on the other side. Over all both shavers work very well, they were easy to clean and maintain but I did notice a few differences between the two. 1) The series 5 appeared to have slightly less power then the series 7 2) I prefer the feel and grip of the series 5 3) The series 5 did not cut as quickly as the series 7. I had to make several passes to get a clean shave. All in all if I had the choice I would pick the series 7 over the 5 but this is still a very good shaver and I would recommend the brand and the model to those in the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m speaking for my husband, but I know he is very happy with his new shaver.</li>
    <li> For the price I expect a closer shave with fewer strokes and less snagging. The cleaner thing works really well. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied, but wish I&#x27;d paid a little less.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for what we had before. Husbands favorite razor-ever.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my husband has used several Norelco shavers in the past but could not find replacement parts for them. He wanted this Braun shaver possibly because of the name sake. He says: &amp;#34;IT takes me three to four times the amount of time to do the same job that I did with the Noreco&#x27;s and it burns the skin horribly&amp;#34; A very pricey mistake I would say.</li>
    <li> Shaves but not close enough and cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find out how to use ,thanks</li>
    <li> good razor. hard to maneuver through small areas of the face. Gets a close-ish shave at first, very close if you sit in front of the mirror for 3-5 mins on the same spot. only problem is this thing asks to be cleaned very frequently. Use it once and it will cry to be cleaned (through the tear drop icon it shows, seriously) I suppose im happy with it. Ive gotten just as close shaves with the 3 circular style electric razors and they seem to maneuver a little better since you can focus just one of the blade circles on a small area. The trimmer is weird. It juts towards the user, so you cant really see where the blades are while you use it. I used my old razor (with the trimmer facing up relative to razor) to cut side burns and widows peak. i cant do that anymore with this because i cant see where im cutting. more like feeling it out and praying you mess your lines up.</li>
    <li> Shaver works as advertised.  Very happy with purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun Electric Shaver I&#x27;ve owned in a 30 year span and by far the best. My last one I had 18 yrs and still working&lt;br /&gt;but just not holding the charge well took care of it changed cutter and foil once every couple of years. Didn&#x27;t realize how week my&lt;br /&gt;old shaver was till received and used this new 5 5090cc wow great shave I would highly recommend this shaver for anyone looking&lt;br /&gt;for a nice close shave and comfortable too. Received faster than the projected date and packed well. The price couldn&#x27;t be beat was&lt;br /&gt;60 dollars less than the largest department store in the country.</li>
    <li> Very very good shaver</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he LOVES it!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get a close as my Panasonic. Ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I downgraded from a series 7 because I wanted to save a few bucks and I&#x27;m sorry I did.  The actual shaver is ok. It gets the job done.  The trimmer design though is terrible.  It&#x27;s angled to a point that makes it difficult to use and it&#x27;s tiny.  The cleaning dock is bulky and the technology of the shaver itself isn&#x27;t as smart as the 7 series.  If you turn this shaver on for 2 seconds (I tested it), it indicates a cleaning is needed.  The 7 series is smarter than that.</li>
    <li> It shaves much better than my old series 5 and the cleaning base does not back up and spray all over like the old base did.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Comfortable shave.  Major upgrade from my old BrAun.  Works like a champ.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped. It does a good job of getting everything, but isn&#x27;t as close as my 10+ year old Panasonic. If I want a closer shave, I follow up with the Panasonic for the limited time that its battery lasts. For the Braun I would like to see better shaving performance, less bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: I finally got some NiHM bateries that have enough power for my old shaver. The old shaver is much faster and closer than the Braun. The Braun has a leisurely hum, the Panasonic works much faster. It takes half the time to shave with the Panasonic and there is no mess from it. I have gone back to using my old Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving results.</li>
    <li> Fixes your skin problems, gives you the closest shave you ever had, zero hair pulling, battery life is crazy long, and it shaves my very difficult beard with electric shave solution from amazon beautifully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not good enough but I couldn&#x27;t give it back</li>
    <li> This is my first foil electric shaver, and so far I really like it. It gives a smooth shave without the cuts and razor burn. It&#x27;s very simple to use and the cleaning system keeps it sanitary and working properly. My only complaint is that if you  run across any longer hairs you will get a little pinch or pull. But overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> So far I love the design, although it does take some time to get a good full shave, as the foil holes might be a bit too small to get all the hairs in one stroke, so several passes are required. But it feels good in my hand, and the cleaning system is very fast. The base seems to be made cheaper than the older model, but works very well as it connects more tightly to the shaver. The only complaint is the shaver head....while it is nice to have tilt in both directions, because its &#x27;new&#x27;,  the older model foils wont fit this one!</li>
    <li> After a mishap which involved inadvertently tossing my 3 year old 5 Series into a dumpster, I was forced to purchase a new shaver.  I am pleasantly surprised on how close it shaves without irritation. The only two minor  criticisms, and one is just a design preference for me: you can&#x27;t loosen the sceen housing on  both  sided and run the shaver to lightly clean out hairs.  The screen is either on or off; latches on one side (kinda have to have&lt;br /&gt;another Braun to visualize). Other criticism is the trimmer is too narrow. My older 5 Series had approx 3/4 inch long trimmer; this is closer to 1/2 inch. Again, not deal breakers in any way. If you are reading  this trying to decide, I say Go For It!</li>
    <li> It got broken in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Very nice design  Comfortable to hold and shave with.  Pretty good close shave!  Holds charge for a good while!</li>
    <li> beter than Remington and Norelco. I MUST CHANGE THS REVIEW AFTER 9 MONTH USE OF THE SERIES 7090CC SHAVER. IT DOES NO GIVE A SATISFACTORY CLOSE SHAVE. IFOUND THE NORELCO CLOSE SHAVER SUPERIOR IN THE CLOSSNSS OF THE SHAVE.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for a week or so, and it works wonders.  I have very sensitive skin, and this does not irritate it at all.  But it does completely clear my stubble in just one to two passes.  Fair warning, though... it has a VERY short cord.  So make sure for the charging/cleaning station, you&#x27;re setting up right next to an outlet, or you have an extension cord.  Also, stock up on cleaning solution.  each cleaning cycle goes through a fair amount of fluid.  I don&#x27;t see each cleaning kit lasting more than a month.</li>
    <li> Not to good.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I was using the same electric razor for the last 18 years. And finally it was time to move on... Mainly because they stopped selling my replacement screens and blades in stores.  I tried out a few others before this Braun unit and each one was simply not impressive for the price they were asking.  Either they were not very close of a shave as I am used to, or they didnt do a good job for shaping around my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;- I have been using the Braun 5090 for a couple of weeks now, and I am glad that I made a decision to get this one.  The shave is the best I have ever had.  I am able to shave my sensitive throat areas without irratation, and the battery so far is long lasting as expected from the lithium (I charge it once every Sunday).  Unlike other shavers that are cordless this one will actually allow you to shave while plugged in, this is big for those that plan on having it around for the next 20 years like me when the battery is not as good as it first started.  This razor has a very powerful motor but is super quiet, compared to my old one and those i tried before this.&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides if I had to come up with them are not nearly enough to say no to purchasing or changing my 5star rating..  First the trimmer on the back is not as good as others, and second the design of the blades is so that it allows for the best cut but does not allow you to manually clean it with a brush, which is why they give you the option to use water to rinse off and the cleaning base with the solution.  Short term it seems fine, but I will need more time to see how the blades last long term.&lt;br /&gt;* I happened to buy this razor as part of a gold box sale- I am not sure I would have even looked at this because of the original cost, but now that I have used it - I would have gladly paid the higher cost to have this razor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver! Love the pivoting head and how it glides smoothly over the curves of my neck without nicks! Clean up is super easy with the self cleaning feature! Love the trimmer extension as well! Great idea to combine a shaver and a trimmer all in one unit!</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this new Braun Shaver, It comes in a great package and has a good look.  This razor makes my face so smooth, no bumps or razor burn.  No oops I cut my face and the shaving happens much quicker then using my old razors.  I would recommended this razor to anyone looking to buy.  You cant go wrong with this shaver</li>
    <li> I received the Braun 5090CC free from Braun to try and review.  The clean and charge part work fine.  The design is fine.  I just thought it would provide a better shave.  I get better results from a traditional blade shaver and find that is a better option unless I want a very quick shave and closeness is not that important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is not inexpensive.  If a good but not great shave is OK for you, and speed is important, this may be worth your while.  For me, taking a few more minutes to deal with shaving cream and water along with the blade shaver is important for my workday so, the Braun is not the right choice for me.</li>
    <li> good shaver, better than my old Panasonic.  Just not as much so as they hyped it to be.</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from Bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you... this product is AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;It gave me the best shave I have had in years and am very impressed with the quality and design</li>
    <li> I recently received a series 5 razor from Braun for free to review and have to say that I&#x27;m switching to an electric razor. I have been hesitant to purchase one myself because I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t think there was an electric shaver that was effective but gentle. I received the Series 5 5090 and it looks good. Sleek and sophisticated. My wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it sitting on the bathroom counter so I think it&#x27;s been approved to live there. I have a beard so the trimmer was a welcomed surprise. I used the shaver on my mustache area and was pleased that it didn&#x27;t pull hairs or nick my skin. Cleaning is a breeze too! Just set the shaver in the base and it cleans and charges at the same time. Honestly wouldn&#x27;t have considered purchasing this product on my own since I was uneducated on the technological advances electric razor have had but I won&#x27;t be switching back to the disposable variety!</li>
    <li> Brilliant close shave.greatly improved cleaning system</li>
    <li> After about three weeks, I like it well enough. Takes a while to mow thru my older-guy stubble. No bandaids now.</li>
    <li> It has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using this razor. My first thoughts, were it was going to take forever to shave now, it was going to wake my wife and daughter in the morning, and it just won&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s a great concept. It does take a little longer to shave and it&#x27;s not as close as my manual razor is, but it is smooth. I noticed that it also pulls a bit, so you have to be careful if you&#x27;ve got long or curly hairs. I&#x27;m enjoying the self cleaning mechanism! I would like to have that for every razor lol. It&#x27;s a good razor, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090cc shaver for free from Braun! In the history of electric shavers the saying is true; you get what you pay for. I have bought the cheaper drug store shavers for $20 and well, they can be horrific! I have also gone for more expensive brands but they have left me unimpressed. From the start, when looking at the packaging for the Braun Series 5 5090, I already knew this was no ordinary shaving system. The packaging and write up was well presented and made the product appealing. But who cares about the box right! I opened it up and was pleasantly surprised with a very nice, easy to hold, light weight shaver. The trimmer popped up easily into position. The buttons and grips are fluid and easy to use. I took out the travel case and thought &amp;#34;nice touch!&amp;#34; Then I pulled out the charge and clean station. Now that is something well thought out that I have never had before! What a great idea of place the shaver blade side down to charge and let the alcohol cleaning solution have at it. No more running a shaver under the faucet and getting out clumsy tiny brushes to sweep clean the beard hairs. You place the shaver down and with a push of one button the alcohol solution cleans and sanitizes the shaver effectively! The shaver sits slightly crooked so that the solution does not remain on the shaver and keep it wet. I can tell you I am very particular when it comes to clean and this fits my expectations perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The real meat of the issue is the shave. I cannot rave enough about this shaver. With other brands and other shavers I notice that the shaver heats up after about one minute and the heat is painful and damaging to my skin. The Braun Series 5 5090 never heated up. It kept my skin cool the whole time. In the past I have had to go over certain hard to shave areas over and over with other shavers. The Braun Series 5 5090 took care of every hair so close with one swipe through. This is truly amazing to me. It did not pull or pinch skin and hair. The shaving head flexes easily over any area of skin at any angle. The shaver did such a great job that my skin has never been so smooth after a shave until now. I also did not have to add any aftershave or cooling cream to my face once the shave was done.&lt;br /&gt;The shave and the trim were also spot on in accuracy. My sideburns and even and exact not to mention I did not have to get another razor to complete the fine details like I usually do. This new shaver from Braun is a time saver and a skin saver too.&lt;br /&gt;I am employed with a very large beverage company with a high population of male employees. We are required to keep clean shaven at all times. So many employees have complained about the policy. The time involved in shaving and the constant burn on our face is hard to deal with. These guys are going to love this shaver once I tell them about it.skin and hair. The shaving head flexes easily over any area of skin at any angle.

    <li> Really nice shaver for a quick cleanup. It has not pinched, cut or scratched which is a great plus.  It is very effective when I have been in a hurry before leaving the house for an engagement.  The battery has held the charge for a few days without losing its effectiveness.  In the end, when I really want a very close shave, I go back to my blade razor.</li>
    <li> Upon opening this package, I was impressed. The packaging was impressive, not that impossible to sealed plastic nightmare. It was a box. A nice box. Inside there was a good amount of literature, which was informative. There was also a small brush, a charging cord and station ( a station which cleans the razor, ON ITS OWN, with an alcohol solution, included), and a nifty traveling case. There was also a sleek razor. The button felt solid. The slide out trimmer mechanism was solid and reliable. The whole thing felt great, a little lighter than expected, but great. I followed the charging instructions, patiently waiting like a little girl with three days worth of guerrilla warfare beard growth. I have extremely thick hair, and when I say thick, it&#x27;s record book thick. I also have very sensitive skin, which has always been a problem with electric razors in the past. I get horrible burn and bumps from using the past models and makes. Not this one. My skin was soothed, and soft. However, it took about six million passes to accomplish this task. It was unable to get the hair on my adam&#x27;s apple altogether. I gave up. But, the hair that it did shave was baby smooth. If I wasn&#x27;t a freak of nature, this was easily a five star review. It charges quickly and cuts well. I traveled with it for a week solid, and it never whined. It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s water resistant, and you can just run it under a faucet to clean it while you are away from the base. On the base, it tells you when to charge, and when to clean with a nifty light up panel. And when cleaning it makes a really satisfying buzzing noise. Which means it&#x27;s working. The base is a little big, as I live in a hundred year old home, and my girlfriend has claimed a lot of counter space. I feel a slight man victory, but it could possibly take up too much room. I would recommend it to anyone who would listen. Five stars as soon as it shaves me clean.</li>
    <li> What a great shaver! And what a great cleaning system. I&#x27;ve been an electric shaver user for most of my 40+ shaving years. Almost exclusively with a Braun shaver. My last Braun unit is finally dying after 15 years. It was great with long battery life. This one is even better. Great smooth, close shave. No irritation. I have a average to thick beard growth and fairly sensitive skin so I recognize a good shaver. I use the cleaning system weekly, not daily. Works great. Between using the cleaner/charger, I just use the shaver daily as in normal use. The shaver in the cleaner/charger takes up a fair amount of vertical space, so to leave the bathroom uncluttered I have it in another location. I would say that the space the unit needs is the only con on this product. Shaver feels great in your hand. Works easily to shave all areas of your face. Beard/mustache trimmer works great, also. Nice travel case. Holding in the on/off switch to lock it for travel is a nice feature. I do wish the case had room for the power cord also, so you would have one complete unit for packing. Overall, just a great shaver. Even though Proctor &amp; Gamble now own Braun, the product is still high quality and still made in Germany. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. I have used Braun for more than 20 years now. They are always well engineered. Great close shave. The long hair trimmer could be better however.</li>
    <li> I recently received a series 5 razor from Braun for free to review and have to say that I&#x27;ve finally been given a reason to switch to an electric razor. I&#x27;ve tried a few various brands over the past 10 years in hopes of speeding up my shave and have never found one that either felt comfortable, did a close enough shave, or didn&#x27;t end up nicking me. The Series 5 from Braun has taken care of all of those problems and has a self cleaning charge station to boot! The charging station also lets you know when it is cleaning, when the blade needs a clean, and how much juice the razor has left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, not having to worrying about cleaning the razor was a bonus I wasn&#x27;t expecting to love as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what can I say. The shave is close cut and the flexible razor portion was able to easily follow the curves of my face and takes almost no time to shave compared to having to put aside the time I previously had to factor in for a proper shave. I went from a ten-ish minute shave to five and now feel I can get a shave in while rushing in the morning which in the past was something I would preferably avoid at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all of that it has built in tools for dealing with trimming my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with the product as well as the shave that it helps deliver. No more disposable blades, shaving cream, or wasted time in my future!</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using disposable razors since I was in my 20s.  I have only tried an electric razor once before in my life, but did not continue to use it as I have sensitive skin, and I found that the electric razor would pull hair, leave my skin red, and overall not deliver the same result and comfort as a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that technology has changed!  This new Braun electric razor provides a close, clean, comfortable shave, without any of the negative issues that I had previously had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon unboxing, I was extremely impressed with the look and feel of the unit.  It is sleek and attractive.  My wife even commented on the looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base cleaner is a nice feature, and was easy to set up.  The pivoting head allows for me to adjust the razor to best suit the contours of my face, and the trimmer was good for cleaning up the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy this arrived before I left on my current vacation, so that I could bring it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been unhappy with electric razors in the past, I would strongly encourage you to try the new Braun models.</li>
    <li> I received from Braun, free to try, the Braun 5090, and it gave me a clean shave with no irritation (razor burn). Electric razors in the past used to irritate my neck and jawline. I was pleasantly surprised with the clean shave daily in my usual problem areas. I have a goatee and moustache and didn&#x27;t find it difficult at all to trim or shave around it. The head is large and i did find it difficult to get the patch between my nostrils and moustache clean. Still have to use blade for that part. The charging the first time seemed really fast. I was on the road for 4 days, shaved everyday and battery level is still at 5 bars (excellent battery). The long hair trimmer worked great for trimming up my moustache and goatee. The cleaning/charging station seemed pretty sraight forward. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for ease and dependability.</li>

    <li> I received this from Braun to test and review. I really liked it and love how its self cleaning and always charged. Now im nicely groomed. I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Not a close shave and after 3 weeks it misses a lot in neck area. Will get face decent and even tried lectrashave before use. Was hoping for better shave</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from Braun to review, and after using it for two weeks, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I had never used an electric razor prior to this. As a matter of fact, I read the directions front to back and even went on YouTube to see how to best use an electric razor. I also went on Amazon and read some review for other razors to see what it should and should not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one day&#x27;s worth of stubble, I went on my maiden electric razor voyage. And it was okay. It did not get nearly as close as my Mach 3, but I did not expect it to. I used it again the next day with the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I loaded it into the cleaning station. It worked so much better. I wish that the directions said to do this before the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not pull or tug, and seems to do a good job both with and against the grain. I have a beard, so I was using it on my upper cheeks, neck and mustache area. It seemed to handle all of these equally well depending on whether the head was set to pivot or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought nothing of it when I received it, but my favorite feature may have been the precision trimmer. I was able to line my beard up perfectly with it and it made its way through some pretty thick hair with ease. I have used beard trimmers in the past, and this was the best precision tool I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a three star rating because honestly, if I am comparing the shave to what I can do with my Mach 3, it is not as close and really does not save that much time. Having said that, I will like having it around for mornings that I am tired or for an afternoon refresh of the face before a date with the wife. If I was going to use an electric, this would be the one.</li>
    <li> Braun sent me the 5 5090cc to try out. I have always been a razor guy but i have to say i&#x27;ve been reaching for my Braun a whole lot more than i expected i would.  After all it practically cleans itself!</li>
    <li> Very expensive, poor buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Uncomfortable, almost painful . shave,  Not close cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34; Cleaning&amp;#34; fluid,quit after 5 cycles, even though reservoir was still almost half full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have a $ 10 &amp;#34;cheapie&amp;#34; that is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The only plus is the battery;  lasts a full week.</li>
    <li> This razor has made a huge impact on my shave.  The shave is close and smooth.  The trimming abilities are tight and on point.  I have used many razors, and this one is by far the best i have used.  I use this to shave my head as well, and it takes away even the most stubborn of hairs.  Overall could not be happier to have chosen this as my new razor.  -Mark</li>
    <li> I received the Braun 5 from the company to try out and review. I have to say that I was skeptical at first as I had not found an electric razor that would give me the close cut of a manual razor due to the thickness of my facial hair. This shaver really surprised me. It gives a really close shave, keeps its power throughout the shave, and takes the work out of cleaning it after use. My wife even commented on how soft my face is after a shave and how much she likes the Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Razor. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The good folks at Braun sent me a their new Series 5 5090 electric razor, and I looked forward to my first shaving experience with it.  Remember...I&#x27;d be trying this as my first electric shave as I&#x27;ve always used razors with disposable heads.  The reason for this was I had always heard a recurring complaint that electric shaving did not produce as close a shave as traditional shaving cream and hot water shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always envied the speed and ease that electric shaving presented, but I didn&#x27;t want to invest money in an electric shaver only to be disappointed with the result.  After trying Braun&#x27;s new 5090 model, I have been converted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was the ease of getting started with this product.  I went ahead and fully charged it (five minutes is all it takes for one shave, but I went ahead and left it overnight).  The next morning I started my day by shaving my dry unwashed face.  The shaver performed flawlessly.  I have areas of my face where I have cowlicks of beard growing in multiple directions, and I have to work tediously with my handheld traditional cartridge razor before I feel a smooth face.  With the Braun, I only had to go over that area once to feel that the hair growing in all directions was removed and my skin was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that time, I have used the shaver twice, and both times yielded the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mentioned that cleaning this shaver is easy.  In fact a little light comes on to let you know it needs to be cleaned.  Then, something that I didn&#x27;t know about...you just set the shaver in a &amp;#34;cleaning station&amp;#34; and it is cleaned automatically, while it is also being charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the second best about this shaver is that it has the characteristic that I expected: speed.  I&#x27;m done shaving in just a few minutes.  This is something that I&#x27;ve always envied about my friends who used electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best, though, is something that I didn&#x27;t expect, and that is the smooth, close shave that it gives me.  It&#x27;s a shave that&#x27;s much closer than my cartridge razor. With the Braun taking away the mess of shaving cream, the experience is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...being the results-driven person that I am...I get a closer shave in much less time.  Perfect!at I didn&#x27;t expect, and that is the smooth, close shave that it gives me.  It&#x27;s a shave that&#x27;s much closer than my cartridge razor. With the Braun taking away the mess of shaving cream, the experience is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...being the results-driven person that I am...I get a closer shave in much less time.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I liked the razor.  I liked the cleaning aspect of the product.  It was a fairly close shave.  I&#x27;ve been using a Phillip Norelco for years.  I still like the closeness of shave with the Norelco but I would recommend the Braun shave for the shave and the cleaning.</li>
    <li> After using it one time, I was not at all thrilled with the results.  The razor left patches of hair all over the place.  However, this was my own fault, I was trying to use it like a traditional blade razor.  Once I figured out that I needed to use a circular motion the results were fantastic.  There was no hair pulling like I&#x27;ve heard about some other razors and it left me with a smoother shave than the Mach 3 that I usually use.  Overall I would have to say it&#x27;s a fine machine and I love the little self cleaning charging base it comes with.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure - I have only used electric razors for the last 20 years, so there will be no comparisons to &#x27;traditional&#x27; razors here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive my Braun 5090 for two reasons.  First, I was eager to upgrade from my old Braun 7680 razor and see the difference.  And second, the 5090 uses the same &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Renew&amp;#34; system, which means my bulk purchase of cleaning solution pods will not go to waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it maybe a half dozen times by now, and there is a clear difference in the closeness of the shave.  I just changed the foils and blades in my old razor, so this is as close to &#x27;apples-to-apples&#x27; as I can possibly get.  My skin is very sensitive (part of the reason I use electric in the first place), so I am used to only being able to shave every 2-3 days unless I want to look like a swarm of hornets had an argument with my adam&#x27;s apple.  The biggest test was shaving on consecutive days, and the 5090 passed with flying colors!  After three mornings in a row, there was very little irritation to my ridiculously sensitive neck - a person with more normal skin should have no irritation at all.  And as expected, the Clean &amp; Renew part of it resulted in the razor looking like it just came out of the package again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the pop-up trimmer.  I have used the trimmers on all of my electric razors in the past the same way - a single pass over my beard brings it down to the rough equivalent of a 3-day growth.  With the 5090 it doesn&#x27;t seem up to the same task.  It is noticeably smaller, which means less area gets covered, and my short beard simply doesn&#x27;t seem to get much shorter.  As a shaping tool, it works fine - sideburns, beard edges, etc.  Again, this is the only negative I have to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thank you Braun for continuing to improve on your already excellent products.  But if you could just give me back my old pop-up trimmer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clear 4/5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090 CC Shaver from the manufacturer to test out and review. It gave a much better shave than i expected since i have not had a good experience with electric shavers. My husband used this on his face despite his hesitation having sensitive skin. Typically he breaks out from razor burn and this razor that didn&#x27;t happen. He is so thrilled i decided to try it out on my legs. I was pleasantly surprised at the shave i received and how close the shave was on my legs. I am so happy with this razor im stealing it from my husband and he can get his own. On to the cleaning part. This is all very new to me since i have never had a self cleaning razor. So far so good its super easy and very quiet.</li>
    <li> I received this from Braun, and I must say, it is everything you would ever need in a razor.  The amount of power that this razor has is amazing.  Much stronger than any other electric razor that I have tried.  The self cleaning and lubricating is nice, but to be honest not sure I will be purchasing more cartridges for that.  But I do love the razor, nice close shave  Great investment.</li>
    <li> It met all of my expectations and more. It only re-affirms my view of the quality of earlier Braun products I had purchased over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It performs with excellence.</li>
    <li> Good shave...blows norelco out of the water IMO and is good for sensitive skin. My dermatologist said I should try a foil shaver for my skin type it works well, it leaves my skin very smooth and will stick with braun until the day I leave this planet.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090 CC Shaver from the manufacturer to test out and review for free. I am not a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; electric shaver user. For the past 5+ years, I&#x27;ve been using a razor and shave cream to shave each morning. I have tried a few different electric shavers in my life, but nothing compares to the this Braun! From the first time I used it till now - a month later - I am totally impressed with how close my shave is, how easy the shaver is to you, and how amazing the cleaning contraption is! I have not bought a razor in over a month and I don&#x27;t see myself going back to the &amp;#34;old way&amp;#34; any time soon! I highly recommend this product to men who have to shave every day.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Shaver With Cleaning Center, which I received free from the manufacturer to try out and review.This was my first ever experience with an electric shaver.  I liked that I got a clean shave and it pivots with the contours of my face. It was easy to use and less complicated than actually shaving with a razor. I didn&#x27;t need shaving cream and I didn&#x27;t have to wet my face. Perhaps the best part of this shaver is the clean up. It was so easy! Really I didn&#x27;t have to do anything but set it in the charger for it to self clean. I recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their life easier.</li>
    <li> I recived this razor free to test #gotitfree Being a black man I have a hard time shaving with anything but a striaght blade, and where this razor looks really nice and it&#x27;s very easy to use, I have used this 3 times now and each time I ended up with major razor bumps,so I did give it to my father in law who is white and only has use of one arm and he feel in love it said it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever used and threw out the razor he&#x27;s been using. So it&#x27;s a great razor just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>

    <li> I received this Braun Shaver to try out from Braun. This is a great shaver. It is well built and it is good looking. From pulling it out of the box it looks expensive. Upon the first shave I found that is was very sharp, very easy to use, and feels great on the skin. It also charges quickly. When using the cleaning mode it has a pleasant lemon fragrance. The reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is that it needs to be used at least every two days or else the hair is difficult to shave. There is some discomfort when shaving the neck area and you need to go over the neck a few times to get a clean shave. Also, the clippers behind the razor are nor sharp and gets caught often. Overall a good shaver if you shave every day. It saves time shaving and is not abrasive on skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  I love it.  Best I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Good solid razor. I&#x27;m a Braun user, have been for years, so this is a new updated model for me. I like electric razors, there is no razor burn, it&#x27;s a clean shave. I have an issue with ingrown hairs on my face (increasing recently), so I&#x27;m always looking for a razor that helps with that..gives a close enough shave to be smooth, but not so close that the hair gets cut under the skin and then starts to grow back and then forms an ingrown hair. This razor is easy to use, it gives a nice clean shave, handles well, and I have not seen an increase in ingrown hairs (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it for now.&lt;br /&gt;Base is large, you need some counter space for it.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and I received The Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Shaver free from Braun to try and review. This is the best electric razor I have ever used. The pivoting head was able to give me a closer shave than any other electric razor I have tried. The self cleaning function is nice and eliminates messy cleanup. Replacement blades and cleaning solutions are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Overall, I think this is a strong overall product. It does it&#x27;s job and the precision trimmer does help line up your facial hair pretty well. I was not a big user of electric shavers, but I decided to give this a try. This product works great when you have little stubble but when the facial hair grows thicker, it doesn&#x27;t cut that well. I feel like I still have to use a Mach disposable razor to clean up the missed up sides.  However, it is a good product and has some cool features. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver free from Braun to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I waited to review this shaver until I&#x27;d had it long enough and used it often enough to be able say with some certainty if it&#x27;s worth its salt. With most electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned--all of them shamed into some wasteland corner of the linen closet by now (because I never know how to actually discard them)--a few weeks is usually the duration of our working relationship. It&#x27;s always one or more of the following: poor motor speed, weak blade, weaker battery, any of which lead to beard irritation and a bad shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 5 5090cc and I are three months into our relationship, and things couldn&#x27;t be better. I mean, this thing knows how to treat a guy. The motor is powerful--even a few-days&#x27; worth of stubble (for a guy who&#x27;s not terribly hirsute, granted) doesn&#x27;t faze this shaver. I get a quick and close shave EVERY time. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, no redness, no neck-rash of red dots that any grown man should have to go into work with. And the battery is long-lasting; it even displays its remaining \\&quot;life,\\&quot; which my other shavers never had the decency to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real bonus, too, is the charging/cleaning station, which CLEANS while you RECHARGE--some kind of small-applicance day spa right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting-edge power of the shaver, the intelligent display, and ability to self-maintain--this is the \\&quot;smart\\&quot; shaver I&#x27;ve been waiting for all my life.</li>
    <li> Shaving efficiency is low</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and I received The Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Shaver free from Braun to try and review.  I must say, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  It has the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor.  It has a sleek design, very light weight and easy to hold and manipulate while shaving.  It shaves so close that it shaved a mole off my neck, so be careful around moles. It has a swivel head that is designed to go over even the toughest areas to get to, and the head also locks into position, but I haven&#x27;t really found the need to do that.  I loved the built in trimmer also.  It could have been a little wider, but it does just fine.  The cleaning station does a great job of making my razor feel like new every time I use it. I don&#x27;t want to forget to mention it tells you how much of a charge you have on the razor itself.  I recommend not washing your face before you shave because it doesn&#x27;t do as good.  Its like the razor doesn&#x27;t glide over your face as well.  It also comes with a travel case that is hard and I like that because the ones I have had in the past either didn&#x27;t come with one or they were soft.  If I dropped it, I can be assured it isn&#x27;t broken with this travel case.  By far the best electric shaver I have ever had and used.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  I upgraded from the older Series 5 model, and this is a noticeable improvement.  The flexible head gives a close shave even in difficult areas such as the neck.  It&#x27;s quiet and seems like a solid quality-built product.</li>
    <li> I really like the shave this gives, my old Braun used to leave short hairs in some parts of my chin and this one can reach those tricky spots better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the shaver has a somewhat finicky fit with the charging station.</li>
    <li> With my sensitive skin I Love the alcohol-based Clean &amp; Charge Station that saves time and cleans, charges and lubricates at the touch of a button&lt;br /&gt;Th cutting crosshair and flex motion  blades  that get those course hairs and difficult areas and brings closeness that doesn’t irritate me skin.&lt;br /&gt;PowerDrive allows high speed cutting and saves me time on those early morning shaves before work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never thought I would stop using my disposable and trimmer but I have! Recommend this product! Thanks Braun!!</li>
    <li> Everythings was ok, thank you.</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver. Quickly gives a smooth shave without irritation, burn or pulling.  Also gets any whiskers that lie flat efficiently.</li>
    <li> I received the 5090cc shaver from Braun to review.&lt;br /&gt;I have now been able to use it for a few weeks now and I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great:&lt;br /&gt;*Solid razor, good weight. Feels like a quality tool.&lt;br /&gt;*looks great&lt;br /&gt;*quality switches&lt;br /&gt;*Strong motor&lt;br /&gt;*very good shave!  Nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;*super easy to drop into the charger/cleaner&lt;br /&gt;*indicator to let you know when it needs to be cleaned&lt;br /&gt;*automatic cleaning is cool and easy WHILE RECHARGING!&lt;br /&gt;*pop up trimmer is intuitive and works great&lt;br /&gt;*no redness or irritation at all! I didn&#x27;t need any type of break-in period as I have with previous razors&lt;br /&gt;*no snagging or pulling even with a few days of growth&lt;br /&gt;*long battery life. No problem taking it on vacation without the charger&lt;br /&gt;*however, the cord is small and you can charge it without the cleaning station for travel&lt;br /&gt;*if you forget to charge it for a long time or get involved in some serious large scale shaving project, it will run while plugged in on a dead battery!&lt;br /&gt;*very useful display with all info you could need (charge, cleaning, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as good:&lt;br /&gt;-misses a few hairs on the first pass but not as many as my previous Phillips/Norelco&lt;br /&gt;-cleaning solution needs to be changed every few weeks&lt;br /&gt;-longer hairs are a bigger problem for main razor but pop up trimmer does a great job on them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a &#x27;cutting&#x27; edge shaver with all the features I could want and a great shave to boot!  This has replaced my Norelco for close shaving duties.</li>
    <li> 2 stars &#x3D; translated &#x3D; I Don&#x27;t Like it (as defined by Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this shaver, all indications are that it is a domestic U.S. product.  The fact is, it is not. So why is this important?  If you have a tough beard and need to replace your foil &amp; cutter much sooner than the typical 18 month period, you will likely find that not even Amazon sell the proper - 52b - combination foil &amp; cutter replacements.  I recognized this when I closely compared the 51s geometry to the 52b that is present on this shaver.  Amazon makes no mention of the fact that his &amp;#34;Series 5&amp;#34; shaver is a different beast, intended for the worldwide market except for the United States.  It&#x27;s been available since 2012 but you will encounter dead ends trying to locate the replacement head and foil.  When you call Braun&#x27;s customer service line, they will tell you it is a new product and parts are not yet available - so I reiterate - it has been out since 2012 worldwide.  So what gives?  I would implore potential buyers to contact Braun (Procter &amp; Gamble) and ask about product support.  Personally I am concerned about U.S. support on this product over the longer haul as Braun has historically been all about customer support and exceptional products.  But this particular razor is an oddity in the history of Braun.  Are they dumping product in the U.S. because of slumping sales and/or a design issue?</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying that I received this shaver from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used the shaver for a month, I like it and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it and using it out of the box, my initial impression was that it was ok, but not outstanding.  After a couple shaves, I used the included cleaning station.  What a difference that made.  My recommendation is to use the cleaning station before your first shave.  The razor now gives a much better shave.  I’ve used it on stubble from 1 to 3 days old and it does a good job all the way around.  The built in precision trimmer is great at tidying up my goatee.  The razor is easy to clean both with and without the charging station.  My main hesitation is not with the trimmer itself but with the charging station.  I’ve changed the cleaning solution once already which was simple and easy but in my mind, the charging station unnecessarily adds to the price and is just something else that can break or malfunction.  I would have liked to have seen it as a separate accessory that could be purchased if one so chose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a good shaver/excellent shaver after an initial cleaning.  I will definitely continue to use it and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this one-star review solely for the purpose of pointing out and complaining about yet another Braun model that changed to the one-piece foil/cutter cassette. Now only their Series 1 models have a separate foil and cutter. These cassettes are harder to clean. You can&#x27;t clean the cutter block with the brush any longer. You&#x27;re stuck having to use the cleaning station or running water to properly clean the assembly.</li>
    <li> Shaver is powerful and not too loud. Only drawback is this model does not come with a plastic sleeve that typically fits over the shaver head.</li>
    <li> Excellent, a good product and experience</li>
    <li> Overall, I think this is a very good electric razor. I have always had trouble with razor bumps in two main areas: to the left side of my mouth and the left side of my neck. The Gillette Fusion was my regular-type razor of choice, but those two spots seem to perpetually plague me while shaving. I figured I would try an electric. With this one, it&#x27;s sort of ironic I ended up having problems in the same areas. I&#x27;m sure it is because of the way I hold the razor I&#x27;m using. Also when I try to really get a close shave in those areas, that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m likely to have razor burn problems. Since this model is waterproof I figured I would try using shaving gel I still have, and what do you know? An irritation-free shave! Sure it isn&#x27;t as convenient as a dry shave, but if it keeps my skin from having red marks all over the place, then so be it&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cleaning system, I believe it&#x27;s worth it and not just some gimmick. It keeps the unit lubricated and clean, which is good since I would probably forget to oil the blades if I had to do it manually.</li>
    <li> Just noise,when I bought was 208...now is 139.99...</li>
    <li> Close smooth shave, leaving my skin super soft. The cleaning base you just set it in is an awesome idea. It takes me about five minutes to shave now and have no clean up. I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband just got this shaver and loves it.  He was using a manual razor before this.  He said this provides a very clean, smooth shave.  He won&#x27;t be going back.  It was easy to use - from charging to cleaning.  The instructions included were very clear, and everything about it was a good experience.</li>
    <li> This would have been a 5 star product if the long hair trimmer was a bit more aggressive.  The long hair trimmer seems weak in comparison to an older model of a Panasonic electric shaver I’ve been using for years that cost a 1/3 of what this product is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the long hair trimmer that was just short of my expectations for such a pricey electric shaver, the shaver itself works very well.  If you are like me and have sensitive skin, this is the shaver for you.  Even in the areas where I needed to go over, the skin did not become red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the rotating head, it made the shaving experience a lot more efficient compared to my older Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system not only cleans the product, but it also charges the electric shaver as well.  The charging base is able to analyze the amount of cleaning the shaver needs and it lets the user know by indicating how many water drops appear on the base of the charging/cleaning base.  The more the water drops, the more cleaning the shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shaver for about a week now and I am more than satisfied with the product.  My only issue is the weak long hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090 Clean &amp; Charge electric razor from Braun and was excited to try it out but after using it 8 or so times I have to say I am not much of a fan.&lt;br /&gt;I found that if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple days, it has a tenancy to pull the longer hairs on my face but also won&#x27;t pick up the shorter hairs either. This razor would be perfect if you want a consistent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or a stubbly look and not if you are looking for a clean shave look.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the tray that holds the cleaning solution has to be replaced at a cost every couple of months instead of being able to just empty out the tray and put new solution in. It seems very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Wow was I wrong!  The Braun Series 5 is amazing!  I had been debating on getting an electric shaver but could not justify spending $ on something I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was going to like.  This could not have come from Braun at any better time!  I have always used a regular razor thinking this was the closest shave I could achieve.  I was wrong.  The Braun Series 5 offers a very close, smooth shave.  No more nicks from blades and nice and smooth.  I love how easy this is to use.  I used to get itchy irritated skin under my chin and now that is gone.  This shaver offers a very smooth shave and has cut down on the time it takes me to shave.  I also love that I no longer have to use shaving cream.  There is also no clean up involved.  I simply return the shaver to the base to clean and charge and viola!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also comes with a handy travel case.  I was able to take this on multiple trips now and I love it.  It is very compact and the case has hard sides so I do not have to worry about damaging it.  There is also a pop up trimmer on the razor that allows me to clean up my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to others?  ABSOLUTELY!  I am telling everyone I know to run out and grab one of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quick and easy, very close shave, no more irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Cleaning station is a bit bulky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of electric shavers. I could never seem to get as close of a shave as I like. I received this electric shaver from Braun to try for free in exchange for an honest review. So here goes...I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised at just how close of a shave this shaver gives. It was much closer than expected. The overall design of the razor is very sleek and handsome. It looks great adorning my bathroom vanity. The ease of use is fantastic as well. It took just a very few minutes for me to unpack it and get it ready to charge for its first use. Having said that I did take off one star because of the cost of replacing the cleaning cartridges. For such a pricey shaver I wouldn&#x27;t expect an ongoing expense. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the automated cleaning was nice but I would think a simple rinse after a normal shave would suffice.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading dozens of customer reviews of other shavers, and trying a popular name-brand rotary shaver that gave me shaving rash. This one doesn&#x27;t. This is expensive, but I knew I wouldn&#x27;t end up replacing it for another so may not be so expensive in the long run. I&#x27;ve read some complaints on other screen shaver&#x27;s &amp;#34;closeness,&amp;#34; if you want a very close shave then use a razor, period. That said, I find the shave accpetable for my office environment. As far as the center &amp;#34;UltraActiveLift&amp;#34; strip goes, I don&#x27;t see any advantage, as I had a small strip of long stubble develop right under my chin over a week, and it didn&#x27;t get it, I had to trim it first with another type of cutter (the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; will suffice). I don&#x27;t use the integral trimmer attachment as I have a dedicated beard trimmer for that. For those who don&#x27;t know: Screen shaver types like this one do not work (well) on long whiskers. You need to keep it trimmed at least once every two days in order for it to keep working on your stubble. This is true of ALL screen shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main shaver battery/motor unit is made in Germany, unlike the other series so I have read (customer comments), and it feels very solid and well-balanced. The shaving head tilts nicely to your facial contour as you shave. It does take multiple passes all over to get a close shave - like most. It&#x27;s nice to be able to run water through the screens to clean it, and that cleans surprisingly well - even though not necessary with the cleaning station. If I had to say something negative about this product, I have only two: Like all bathroom items, the charger cord could be a little longer (and not coiled?), and the replacement items, like this original unit, are also a bit pricey. All in all I am just relieved there is still a manufacturer of an excellent screen shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well, liked the sale price.</li>
    <li> The bomb...my 3rd Braun (over the last 15-20 years), each better than the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
    <li> I received this shaver free from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an electric shaver that can finally deal with the multitude of cowlicks residing on my neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped right in and decided to give this shaver a try on a week&#x27;s worth of stubble. Where other razors pulled my longer hairs and felt like I had walked into a hornet&#x27;s nest, the Braun Series 5 smoothly glided through and left a smooth trail behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin and am prone to razor burn, even from electric shavers. So far, so good with this edition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is quick and the wireless charging station is top notch. Well done Braun!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Gave this to my father and he really enjoys it.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Shaver from Braun about a week ago.  It was easy to set up and install the cleaning solution.  It took less than an hour to charge the unit. I have never been a fan of electric razors, but after using it for only a week I kinda like the little guy.  I look forward to getting up and shaving in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do not feel that I get a close shave as I would with a traditional razor, but it has probably given me the closest shave with any electric razor.  A plus to this razor is that I do not get any razor bumps as I do with a traditional razor.  It is more forgiving to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two charging options.  You can charge it at the charging station or you can shave with the cord plugged in to the wall, but I think the charging cord is a little too short to use it from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the razor.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was given the Braun series 5 5090 by Braun to try for free. I have only used it a couple times but I can say that I am impressed. This shaver is great as an everyday shaver and a few days in between shaver. Since I have a goatee the option to lock in the pivoting head when I want is great. I get the best of both worlds with one shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I love how easy it is to keep clean. I believe that the cleaning system prevents the normal razor burn I usually get.&lt;br /&gt;The charging system is excellent. The razor holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time and I also like that it comes with a travel cord. I think this razor is well worth the cost especially if you are an everyday shaver. My wife loves how smooth my face is and that I&#x27;m willing to shave more often.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as a sample from Braun.  It gets the job done.  I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric razors.  This one is easy to use and is comfortable against my skin.  The clean and charge station is great also.  Its always ready to use and that is great for anyone that has limited time in the morning as I do with 3 kids.  After a few weeks of daily use, I cant find a problem with it yet!</li>
    <li> Braun sent me the Series 5 5090 electric shaver to review.  I have used other previous Braun shavers and was interested in trying out their newest model.  My first impression was that it looked very modern and sleek and I liked the new updated look.  It also feels lighter and smaller in my hand which makes for a more comfortable grip and better for travel.  After using it for a few weeks now, I really like the pivoting head which makes it easier to get a close shave on my neck and chin.  The motor feels stronger than previous models and I get my desired shave in less time and without having to go over the same areas multiple times.  The cleaning base is a great feature because it is easy to keep the shaver clean and sanitary.  It also charges quickly and keeps its charge for more than enough time to deliver a smooth, close shave.  Overall, it is a great updated Braun shaver with a better look and feel and delivers a clean shave in less time.</li>
    <li> Exellent razor. Has eliminated a lot of the razor burn/bumps I use to get from a regular shaver.</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor from Braun for free, I was skeptical on the outcome but I&#x27;ve had this Braun razor for a few weeks now and so far it has performed better than my previous electric razor. I don&#x27;t clean mine on a daily basis since I shave in my vehicle on my way to work but the cleaning station does give it a fresh feel once cleaned. I also like the way it leaves my skin feeling smooth and without razor burn. It also gives it a clean scent, always enjoyable. I did learn that I should empty the hair and rinse the blade cover with water before placing in the cleaning station to receive the best cleaning. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking to save on disposable razors. I think this will last me for years.</li>
    <li> I was given the Braun series 5  5090 by Braun to try for free. I have been using it for a few months so that I could try it during different situations. I can say that I am impressed. This shaver is great as an everyday shaver and a few days in between shaver. Since I have a goatee  the option to lock in the pivoting head when I want is great. I get the best of both worlds with one shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I love how easy it is to keep clean. The only concern I have is that the cleaning cartridge is disposable. I believe that the cleaning system prevents the normal razor burn I usually get.&lt;br /&gt;The charging system is excellent. The razor holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time and I also like that if I travel I can just take the travel cord. I think this razor is well worth the cost especially if you are an everyday shaver. My wife agrees since I have gotten this to try I now shave every morning instead of waiting 2-3  days.</li>
    <li> Great!  It exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> It gives a very smooth shave</li>
    <li> Works so much better than the 3 series it replaced. The battery lasts longer than my 3 series and it&#x27;s easier to clean. Two things I kind of don&#x27;t like, one, I wish it came with a guard to protect the shaving head during storage. And two, I wish the case that comes with it would have room for the charging cord. If I travel with the razor, the cord won&#x27;t fit in the case with the razor. To me that&#x27;s like a no-brainer....My older, cheaper Braun 3 series had both. Would have given 5 stars if it had those two things because the razor itself is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift so not sure how works so will check back.</li>
    <li> What a nice razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the razor showed up I was a bit hesitant to try because I have gone through many other brands and even some different Braun models without much success. First off, I was very impressed with the self containing container/cleaner. The pop out trimmer on the side works wonderfully on my goatee and even through I don&#x27;t get a smooth shave with the razor it still does a great job for an electric razor. I use it a few times a week and finish off with my standard razor for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have had to date.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well. On me it is shaving as close as a safety razor or my 5 bladed fusion. I do not have razor burn like my old 5885 Braun. That worked well but this shaves closer, has less razor burn, and stays cleaner. I also like the trimmer better as it trims from the back and not from the top which means I have more control.&lt;br /&gt; My only minor issue is when you clean it using the stand it also recharges it. Maybe it is ok to constantly keep it full. My 5885 was a NiMh and needed to be discharged regularly so this constant charging is new. New battery is Lithium Ion though. Also it was expensive. To those that worry about blade replacements it says do it every 18 months. This was one of my better purchases from Amazon as it saved me $25.&lt;br /&gt;I do need to go over my whiskers from many directions to get it close but I have to do this with any of my razors. This has no razor burn so I have no problems doing this. No one should expect perfection with one pass with any razor any how.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Shaver is, for this user, the best electric shaver I have ever owned. Over the years I have owned a number of different Norelcos, a couple of older style Brauns, and a Panasonic wet/dry model. All of those were OK. Some of them were pretty good. But none came close to a real shave. There was always just a bit left. An extra day or two of growth seemed to really challenge some of those older models. The Braun Series 5 5090cc is the first electric razor that I have used that met the challenge and left a result that I would call as close as a real shave, minus the residual smooth feel of whatever cream or lotion you might have used on your face for the real shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I have some minor gripes with the accessories. For one thing, Braun has chosen, as with this and all their current \\&quot;Series\\&quot; razors, to use an external power block \\&quot;smart plug\\&quot; for charging. In a world of a zillion little chargers to carry around, and lose, why gawd why another one? The 12v 4A output of the \\&quot;smart plug\\&quot; is of course more than a USB style connection could have supported - paradise would be ALL little rechargeable personal devices being able to use the same type of USB connected charger. But it does seem that they could have built the charger into the handle. The only reason to have made it an external power adapter is so that it could also do double duty powering the counter-top cleaning and charging station. This approach seems a little cheap for a high end razor like this. Why not one solution for the shaver and one for the cleaning center?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Smart Plug\\&quot; charger also has a very short coiled cord. OK for charging the razor directly. But using it with the included cleaning and charging station means that you had better have a power outlet close by, and low to the counter-top, or you may have to use an extension cord. And, last but not least, the \\&quot;Smart Plug\\&quot; is angled straight out from the socket. A 90 degree charger that would lay flush to the wall would have been more in tune with its mission to recharge, not power while the shaver is in use. The cord needs to be twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the cleaning and charging station. I get it that electric razor makers (Braun, Norelco, Panasonic) have all zeroed in on the cleaning station idea as a way to make sure that the razor owner reliably cleans and keeps his razor operating at top form. The charging stations, for all brands, are also a revenue stream of course. Each brand has a system wherein your are pretty much tied to refreshing the solution by buying the brand&#x27;s official product. The Braun Series 5 5090cc is annoying in that, fresh out of the box and with zero shaves done, it started flashing the time to clean the razor icon after only one use. This is obviously meant to keep the user consuming as much cleaner product as possible. It is probably a good thing in pure performance terms. But there definitely seems to be a guilt, worry and nag element (\\&quot;OMG! Am I not doing my best to keep the razor tip top!?! Duty calls. Time to buy more cleaner!) built into the system that perhaps benefits the company a bit too much. And if you ignore it you have to put up the with illuminated \\&quot;clean\\&quot; icon on the razor handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of day, a great razor. Superb industrial design, sleek looking, fits the hand well, nicely balanced. The free pivoting shave head, that can be locked into a click stop position with a button, makes keeping the head aligned to your face easy. The included travel carry case is handy. The ability to put the razor into travel mode to prevent accidentally turning it on in your luggage is very much appreciated. I tried it out after not shaving for three days. To my surprise I came up with a great shave, first try. No other electric has ever passed that test for this user. Great razor. Wish they would revisit the charger cord length and design.

    <li> This replaced a Braun 8585. Works great with the movable foils. I get a close shave.</li>
    <li> FOREWARNED AND ENJOYING RAZOR&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE A HEAVY BEARD IT WORKS FLAWLESS....EXCEPT THE COST OF THE DISINFECTANT TANK ABOUT $5 PER MONTH. IT IS A GOOD SHAVE...BUT .... IT SAYS RIGHT ON THE BOOK TO NOT EXPECT IT TO LAST OVER 18 MONTHS. THAT DOESN&#x27;T SOUND LIKE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE PRODUCT BY THE MAKER. REMEMBER THE OLD SLAP ON THE FACE WITH A CLOSE SHAVE? HERE IT IS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This is my forth Braun electric shaver.  I liked everyone of them.  The time period of use is of course many years.  I can&#x27;t remember what the first model was, but the last three were the 5710 FreeGlider, 8985 and now the 5090cc.  Each one establishes to be better with ergonomics.  I would have given it five stars but I prefer the 8985 cutter bar.  The wider bar I believe was more useful.  However with all of them you have to work them in.  Each shaves better with a little time.  And now this one is my favorite. Thank you Braun for putting out a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an 8000 series shaver, for which the cleaner unit had gone kaput. This shaver seems to shave a bit closer, but it might be just the new cutter head compared to my old shaver. It&#x27;s slimmer in the hand and with a rubber coating is grippier. Do I like it better? Not really. Two gripes: It pinches around my beard edges, which the old shaver did not. And the new cleaning unit, with its stark black, Darth Vader look, is even uglier than the old one, if that&#x27;s possible. Also it&#x27;s non-curved top seems to attract dust. I guess they figure all guy stuff has to be black, but it&#x27;s really ugly. Also: It&#x27;s no quieter than the old cleaner (a gripe of some people; I never cared that much) and it leaves the shaver head wet LONG after cleaning (like, the next day). My old cleaner didn&#x27;t do this. The shaver always felt clean and fresh and dry. This one feels like it needs to be toweled off before using. I note that a &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; now is include on the ultra-expensive Braun shaver. Lame. The old unit also seemed to be more intuitive about sensing what &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; of cleaning the shaver needed. All things considered, I see his new shaver as a small step backward from my previous one. Probably should have just replace the cleaning unit!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I have used a Braun razor for years and this one is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> The Braun 5090cc gives the closest shave with the least skin irritation that you can possibly get, to date [Period].  The 5090cc is not a wet-dry shaver, but the trade-off for Combination Flexible Motion Head and Flexible Motion Screen-Blade sections is an absolutely Unbeatable Smooth, Comfortable, Non-Irritating, Effective and Efficient experience... A TOTAL WINNER !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve tried countless brands and models of shavers over 50 years and this (and its predecessor 6000-series model) just can&#x27;t be beat for any individual with light to mixed light and heavy hair on their face (and the curse of sensitive to hypersensitive skin to any and every form of irritation).  All Norelco and even the top line Panasonic wet-or-dry shavers just can&#x27;t get as close a shave, or leave the users face with less irritation, razor burn or other discomforts... and that is WITHOUT using shaving powder, talc, or pre-shave lotions of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Braun 7 series may offer benefits to men with extra heavy or extra fast growing thick and tough hair, but they are not as smooth and irritation free as the 5090cc.  The other 5-series Braun models are very good, but lack the Flexible Motion Head that keeps the 5090 shaver flat and tight against your skin surface as it swing around facial contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It should be noted that right now (2014/12/05) Target.com is selling the 5090cc for the same price, but giving a $20-Off Coupon BONUS on the buyer&#x27;s next Target purchase.  Walmart.com is at the same price, if Amazon is out of stock when you order, but Amazon is easier to deal with if you have a problem or need to return a product.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks of use. Yes. This shaver is high quality. Made in Germany. Durable, great looking. Works fine. Сlean shave. But I feel big distance between first and third heads. They do not work together. Middle head is wide and takes a lot of space between two main heads. BRAUN 5090cc shave clearer than Braun 8000 series 360 Complete but last one has more convenient heads for the face.</li>
    <li> First, I am not a fan of electric shavers. I have used a couple different ones and have always went back to the old stand by disposables. I won&#x27;t be going back to them this time. This has really made shaving easy. It has the trimmer, the shaver and even cleans itself. What else cold you ask for?</li>
    <li> Posted by Gary C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Series 5 shaving system directly from Braun to review and to let them know what I think.  But I&#x27;m so pleased that I wanted to share my experience with everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for decades, but do not like to shave every day because my stubborn whiskers have a tendency to revolt and grow under my skin, causing bumps. So I usually let them grow to about 1/8” long before shaving.  They also have a tendency to lay flay against my skin, which makes shaving them difficult because they don&#x27;t stand up for their turn at the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took the razor and cleaning station out of the box, I could instantly see the fit and finish were first-rate.  I installed the replaceable cleaner/lubricating cartridge in the base, (push a button and the base pops up and the cartridge simply slides right in) plugged the small transformer into the wall and dropped the razor into the top receptacle.  After a surprisingly short 1-hour wait, the razor was fully charged and ready for its first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought, “Wow, this razor seems heavier than the Remington it&#x27;s replacing.”  But after shaving with it, I found my fear was unfounded and the Braun Series 5 is really well balanced and feels very comfortable – not heavy after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first shave, I let my beard grow to about 3/16” long so I would instantly find out how this razor handles longer whiskers.  Would it pull – instead of cut – my whiskers?  Would it miss the lying down ones?  To my surprise, the Braun came up with some rather inventive methods to combat these problems.  My initial shave was the BEST SHAVE I CAN REMEMBER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s head pivots smoothly and follows your face like a laser-guided missile.  And the Ultra Active Lift device does its job flawlessly.  This creative little device sits between the dual screens and excites those flat whiskers into standing at attention and pre-chops them before the screen cutters remove the balance of the whisker.  My first shave came out as smooth as a shave with a brand new top-of-the-line manual razor with much less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it was the trimmer&#x27;s turn to shine (or dive).  Instead of the traditional pop-up trimmer, Braun went with a slide-up version.  The trimmer slides straight up to about the same height as the cutting heads and is not angled like the ordinary pop-up ones.  I didn&#x27;t have much faith in it because it seemed like it was in an unfamiliar position.  But, I was wrong.  This location actually puts your hand hold on the razor in a more comfortable position, which provides better control, especially when trimming vulnerable areas like eyebrows.  And since the trimmer locks in position, it doesn&#x27;t flop down like ordinary razor trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the deed had been done, I placed the razor in its custom base and pressed the &#x27;Clean and Renew&#x27; button.  After a short automated wash cycle, my razor was spiffy clean, smelled citrusy (like the barber shop) and was eagerly waiting for the next shave.  I couldn&#x27;t find even one whisker carcass left in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my Braun Series 5 for over a month now and have found that my bumps are essentially gone, even with daily shaving.  The cleaning station displays the cleaning cartridge life status via a 3-step indicator.  The easy to obtain cartridge should last about one month, but mine has lasted that long and still has some life left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with the Braun Series 5 that I actually threw out my Remington razor and wholeheartedly recommend the Braun to anyone who wants the ultimate in state-of-the-art shaving.em before the screen cutters remove the balance of the whisker.

    <li> This replaced a 12+ year 7570 series that is finally failing and getting parts to repair was becoming more difficult, even new heads. So Braun has come a long way with many improvements over that time. The renew system is faster/quieter and designed better. The shaver is lighter, quieter and more comfortable than my previous. Interestingly it still took about 2 weeks for the face to adjust to the new system, similar to when you mover from razors to electric. The shave is the most comfortable and almost no notable irritation at all anymore, not sure how they did that. The shave is close and clean.</li>
    <li> I received this item as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having had a neatly trimmed beard for a long time now, I was excited to give this Braun Shaver a try, to see how it would handle grooming my neck. It is extremely intuitive to use, and there were no problems with the set up with either the shaver or the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I found that since my hair was a little bit longer and thicker, as I typically do not shave my neck daily, I found that the Braun shaver did not do an adequate job of shaving my neck. I had to go over it multiple times, and it still did not feel like the same close shave I could get from a straight razor. For someone with less facial hair who shaves every day, I can see how great this product would be, especially given the fact that it self-cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it to line up the hair on the back of my neck, and that did work well, as that hair is not as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find an electric shaver that can do my neck as well as a straight razor. However, for those individuals with thinner facial hair, I would recommend giving this shaver a try.</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I used an electric razor and I have never before used a Braun Shaver. That being said, I am rather pleased and surprised by this shaver. I received this shaver free from Braun so that I could review it for them. My first impressions were based on the look and feel of the shaver. The fit and feel in your hand is solid and comfortable. The leather like material that wraps the shaver makes it very comfortable and even gives it a more elegant feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using an electric shaver was a little awkward at first, but after a month of use, it has become much more natural. I read the instructions thoroughly and noticed the specification to shave before washing, which I found a bit odd. I tried once after my shower and soon found out that a damp face prohibits the shaver from smoothly traveling on my face. When I used the shaver as instructed, it traveled on my face smoothly and did a nice job of shaving. I noticed the three \\&quot;heads\\&quot; on the shaver moved independently which enabled effective shaving on all the angles and lines of my face. The head of the shaver adjusts as well to aid in a comfortable use. The shaver is easy to clean up after and holds its charge for more than two weeks. In addition, there is a trimmer that slides into use, which is very convenient and easy to use - a great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it now for about a month, I am able to get a shave that is very close to the same as a manual razor. It did take me about 2 weeks to get this capable with the shaver. I would recommend this shaver to anyone. It provides a great shave, is easy to use and clean, keeps a charge for a long time, feels sturdy (not cheap) - but comfortable and elegant and saves me time every day.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the extra power that&#x27;s advertised. It does make a huge difference! This model does a great job on the neck as well as the face. I get a close save every time. Funny, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from Braun to test out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, my previous experience with electric razors has been very negative.  I had a few cheapo ones in the past that were given to me as last minute birthday and Christmas gifts.  None of these could even come close to replicating that clean, smooth shave that an old fashioned safety razor can give.  Also, it was such a pain to clean them that after using them sparingly for about a month, they&#x27;d find their way to the back of my closet only to return on spring cleaning days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I received a notification from Braun saying I had been selected to try out this shaver for free, I was more than skeptical.  I figured it was just be another dud like all the other ones I&#x27;ve experienced.  I did some quick research on the product, however, and was immediately intrigued by it&#x27;s billing as a self-cleaning shaver.  I&#x27;d never really heard of one of these before but figured if it worked, it&#x27;d be great, since cleaning electric shavers is a major pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my product arrived, I set it up immediately after perusing the easy to read directions and plugged it in for a full charge.  The shaver was fully charged in only a few hours, and supposedly it should last for a full 45 minutes of continuous shaving on one full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try it out, and since I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  My first impression was that it felt nice in my hand and has a pleasing aesthetic about it.  As for the shave itself, I couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised or pleased.  It was smooth on the skin with no painful tugging of the hairs, the head flexed nicely over all of my contours, and the shave was close.  After only going over each spot a few times, my face was smooth....real smooth....just about as smooth as I can get with a safety razor.  Also, this shave was completely dry, so no mess or additional steps or products needed to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I moved onto my neck, and that&#x27;s where I hit a small snag.  Not literally but figuratively.  I had no problems shaving, no pain, or anything like that, but after a few passes (against the grain as it suggests) I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get it as smooth as my face.  I feel like this has more to do with the contours of my neck than the shaver itself, but the fact remained that there were still a couple of rough patched on my neck after shaving.  Now, the shave was definitely quality enough to get the job done.  I could easily leave it be, so not a real big deal.  Just something to be aware of.  It might leave you wanting a little more closeness on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving the first time, I inserted the shaver back into the all-in-one charging/cleaning station (since the directions suggest you clean it after each shave for best results).  Once in the base, it immediately detected that it needed to be cleaned by lighting up an indicator, so I pushed the button and let it do it&#x27;s thing.  The cleaning cycle took about 3 minutes and then the shaver completed it&#x27;s charge as well.  So, I just let well enough alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned to the shaver the next morning, and repeated the above process with no new surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cycle has been going on for about two weeks now, and really I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s cut my shave time down probably by half, and also, I really like the dry shave....no mess to clean or other products to have to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t necessarily see myself never using the old safety razor again.  For instance, if I have the time and want the smoothest shave possible (both face AND neck) I&#x27;ll take the time and do it the old fashioned way.  But for the everyday, morning rush I usually face, this shaver might be me new go to everyday standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m concerned about going forward is having to replace the cleaning cartridges that come with this product.  I&#x27;m hoping the cost doesn&#x27;t add up, but I guess that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have to evaluate down the road.  So, far after about two weeks of regular everyday usage and cleaning, there still seems to be plenty of solution left, so not too concerned yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun for giving me a new found faith in electric razors.ess that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have to evaluate down the road.

    <li> This is beyond a doubt the worst shaver I have ever owned.  To get a good shave it takes way too much time and then some facial areas are hard to shave with this unit.  I tried it for a week before giving up and going back to my five year old $50 Phillips/Norelco, which does a superior job.  I thought that buying a higher priced unit would have some advantages, but the 5090 Braun shaver is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. It def. is a shaver that needs to be used every single day for it to give that close desired shave. My husband works at a 24/7 on-call job, so he doesn&#x27;t always get to shave every single day. If he has gone 3 days without shaving he still needs to use another razor and this shaver for that close shave.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Use it on DRY face before showering.  A+</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used - by far. I&#x27;ve tried cheapo shavers, and they just don&#x27;t work as well. I had an older Braun, and even with new shaving cartridges, it couldn&#x27;t match this new Braun. This Braun gives me the closest shave without any painful skin pulls or irritation. Very happy with this purchase.  I haven&#x27;t tried recharging in the liquid solution, and I&#x27;m skeptical of its benefits.  But I suppose I&#x27;ll try it at some point in the future.</li>
    <li> Up until recently I shaved with a brush, cream, and a safety razor.  But I dislike shaving so I only do it a couple times a week.  I don&#x27;t grow facial hair very quickly but I needed something more often.  I had been looking to buy an electric razor.  I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not nearly as close of a shave as the straight edge razor, nor was i expecting it to be.  After I am done shaving with this electric razor, it feels like 12-24 hours after shaving with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago i had the norelco electric razor with the nivea cream.  I enjoyed that one but didn&#x27;t like the closeness of the shave.  This Braun in far superior to that one.  My face is getting more used to this electric razor and I think the closeness is improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great shaver that works as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: I received this product for free from Braun.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> An excellent and serviceable shaver with just about all of the extras you could ask for. The travel case for the shaver is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is smooth and relatively pain-free. However, the part for longer hair will give you a yank now and then.</li>
    <li> Works very well and smoothly, with a close shave that rivals my straight blade Case shaver from 1912</li>
    <li> This was the first time for purchasing a Braun and so far my husband really like it.</li>
    <li> one of the best shave, first timer with electric shaver</li>
    <li> Easily the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for 15 years this is the best yet.  An added benefit that it is the least irritating for sensitive skin areas of any shaver I have used; in fact it is not irritating at all.</li>
    <li> 5090  shaves fast and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a nice piece of equipment that works very well. I am a bit skeptical about the cleaning center. It seems to do a good job but is it necessary? My old Braun was used for over 10 years, was never cleaned other than blowing the whiskers out, and I replaced the head once. The cleaning center also takes up a lot of counter space and the plug is a huge device plugged into the wall. Prior to this I simply kept my old shaver in a drawer. The shaver itself does a good job and is much faster than my old one.</li>
    <li> This is now my 3rd electric razor, all by Braun. This razor is the best one to date. The head pivots extremely easy which is providing a faster and closer shave. The sides feature a rubbery grip, the width of the razor, at the base, is smaller than my old one and overall it&#x27;s easier to hold and maneuver than my previous razor. The battery level indicator is a nice feature as you will not need to charge the razor each day. You can easily go a week or more without charging. The razor does not seem to lose any power/speed at lower battery levels. This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought the charging station / cleaning version of a razor and so far I like it. I&#x27;ve only cleaned the razor a couple times but it seems to work well. The razor will charge in the station whether you&#x27;re cleaning it or not. The other reason I bought this model is the razor will run while plugged directly into the wall, in case the battery is dead. It comes with a nice semi-hard travel case as well. My only gripe is the base station seems to be larger than it needs to be.</li>
    <li> I currently own a Phillip Norelco 7310 xl and I also have a Gillette Proglide straight edge razor. I use the Proglide when I shave in the shower. Clearly straight edge razors give a closer and more comfortable shave when you have a fresh blade. I do not like using the Proglide when I’m not in the shower because I think that they are too messy. I use the Phillip Norelco on the average twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;In order to compare the two electric razors I shaved one side of my face with each and compared the comfort and the closeness. My wife did the closeness test by feeling both sides of my face. This may not be totally fair since the Phillip Norelco is three years old.&lt;br /&gt;This is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;I found the Braun 5090cc to be slightly more comfortable and to have a slightly closer shave. I like the feel and the weight of the Braun. I like the fact that I could smell the fresh scent of the alcohol. It gave me confidence that it was clean. I also like the convenience of the automatic cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Manual cleaning is another story.  I find the Phillip Norelco easier to manually clean because it has a flip top head. It’s a simple flip and wash to clean the inside and out; whereas with the Braun 5090 cc you have to wash the outside and then snap off the head to wash the inside. I think that this is a decided disadvantage if you choose not to use the automatic cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;An issue with the automatic cleaning system is the cleaning cartridges. I don’t like the idea of having to go to the store to buy cartridges. To me shaving is about comfort of shaving and convenience of shaving. I’m also concerned that someday I will go to the store and they will not have the cartridges because Braun has developed a new system. I would suggest that Braun sell the cleaning and lubricating solution in a bottle. I would think that it would drastically reduce the packaging costs and that Braun could sell the fluid at a reduced cost and still make a profit. This would allow the consumer to simply refill the cartridge as opposed to making a trip to the store. They could still sell the cartridges at the higher price for those that prefer that method.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked the Braun and will continue to use it. I’m not sure what I will do when the cleaning fluid is used up. Thank you Braun for letting me try the razor for free.sumer to simply refill the cartridge as opposed to making a trip to the store.

    <li> This Braun shaver is by far the most powerful shaver I&#x27;ve used.  The ability to use it in the shower is a great aspect as well, although I only use it for brief touch ups when showering because it&#x27;s hard to see in a steamed up mirror.  The sleek and stylish design in my opinion is the best Braun has offered yet.  It fits comfortably in my hand as well.  The only thing I am disappointed with is the trimmer edger component of this shaver.  It seems small compared to the trimmer on other Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used.  It takes a little more time to work with because of this, especially when I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.  All and all though a great product!  The high quality and functionality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Braun. They are a great company, I was even given the opportunity to try this shaver for free from Braun, awesome!!</li>
    <li> This shaver  is everything that everybody else has says it is. Very excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed at first that the seller didn&#x27;t  offer  second day shipping, however, I received the shaver in three days so no problem. For those who can&#x27;t see the lights, the shaver beeps when it&#x27;s low, when you turn it off. So I like that. Also, it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Even though it comes with the cleaning machine, it&#x27;s still very easy to clean manually.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun razors for years now. This is my 3rd one. It is great. Love it. I have had 700 &amp; 300 series. This one is great. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Bought for Husband:&lt;br /&gt;Works GREAT right out of the box.  Very CLOSE shave.  Nice pop up for trim. Hasn&#x27;t used the cleaning center. Rather large device that takes up room on the counter.  If he were to do it over he would just order series 5 WITHOUT cleaner and save a few $$$&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it ..cant go wrong with braun</li>
    <li> Pros: Looks sleek, shaves closely, holds charge well&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cleaning station is a large&lt;br /&gt;I have been using disposable razors all of my life with the exception of an electric razor once before and it wasn’t a good enough shave. This shaver on the other hand is wonderful, it left me with a very smooth face, not cuts or nicks. I shave every morning and the charge lasted about 6 days for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised with how big the box was that the BRAUN SERIES 5 5090 CLEAN &amp; CHARGE came in. The packaging is great and from the moment I opened the box I was able to tell that engineering behind this product was better than previous razors that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I started by using the razor as designed with the cleaner, I was surprised at how clean it is able to get the razor. Over the process of 4 shaves I was able to determine that this razor cuts about as close as my blades do. The cut was wife approved.&lt;br /&gt;I was going on vacation the next week so I took the razor with me. It comes with a nice carrying case and I have been pleasantly surprised by how close it cuts on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this razor. I had no idea that electric razors could leave me with such a smooth face.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Braun to try for free. This razor has a nice design, and is very sleek. The shave was close and clean, with no irritation. The shaver held a long charge, and had a really cool, innovative cleaning cartridge process.  The cartridge refills are easy to find, as are parts should this need to be repaired in the future.  This is a fantastic shaver, that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> After using the Braun series 5 razor for 2 months now the razor has done very well. I like the closeness of a wet shave and have a different brand electric that does a good job with using shaving cream. The Braun doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job if skin is moist or wet. The Braun does an excellent job when shaving dry skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this from Braun to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression when I opened it was that the directions were a little lacking. I went ahead and set it up and let it charge. I shave my entire head,and most of my face, and hadn&#x27;t shaved in over a week. With my old electric shaver, I would never make it all the way through without having to switch to a manual razor.  With this one, not only did I make it through, it did a MUCH better job than my old Phillips. While I did have to do some touch ups with the manual, this did a great job. I was also skeptical how much cleaning the cleaning station would do, but,again I was pleasantly surprised. After the cleaning cycle, it was as clean as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very impressed, and would absolutely recommend this razor</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of electric razors but thought I would check this out.  I have been using it daily for over a month and I am impressed - it has replaced my manual razor.  The Braun 5090cc provides a close comfortable shave every time.  Should be used on dry skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Opening this package was much like getting a new car with anticipation on the features I was about to experience. This product is no joke! I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor before and I&#x27;m definitely sold! I love the new gadgetry, and sleek protective cover that comes with it. I am often running out the door and grabbing this essential must have for my 25 minute drive to work. You do not need a mirror to feel the spectacular results! Trust me if you&#x27;re shopping for a new shaver or electric razor this is definitely worth it!! I would like to give thanks to Braun -- I recently received their product to try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00JA7Q4SQ Braun Series 5 5090cc Electric Shaver With Cleaning Center 1 Count]]</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a BzzAgent for review. From out of the box, thru shaving AND trimming, to recharging in the ,4-action, alcohol-based Clean &amp; Charge Station, this is razor is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to clean,  charge, lubricate, and select the cleaning program at the touch of a button—this shaver feels like new every day.&lt;br /&gt;For a clean shave and trim in the same charge this is what you are looking for. It took me by surprise that both can be done at full strength on one charge without dying!&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head is a great flowing feature for when you need it and the locking feature for when you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver will be in my medicine cabinet aresenal for a long time!</li>
    <li> gets a nice close shave with no razor burn. i normally shave with a disposable for the closeness but this gets it done cleaner and better. would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my Braun Series 5 5090 Clean and Charge razor from Braun late last week and wanted to wait until I had some nice stubble to test it with. After waiting a few days, I was ready to dive in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that the unit has a good look, feel and weight to it. As I was replacing a previous series of Braun shaver, I had high hopes after reading everything on the box about how close a shave would be and how much better it attacks smaller hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was that the shaver cleaning cartridge loads from the back of the clean/charge base. This is the opposite of my previous shaver. Since it loads from the back, I have to move the base, spin it around and load the new cartridge. This isn&#x27;t as desirable because it tends to end in spilling a little cleaning agent during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in, put the shaver in the base and let it get a good charge. I noticed that the lights on the base didn&#x27;t come on initially so I first thought I had a defective unit. I pressed the button on the charging base and the lights came on so I left it to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was ready to shave I played with the movable head (this one has 5 positions where my previous one only had 2), turned it on and off a couple of times to ensure it was working and then moved on to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I noticed that the power button is right where I keep my thumb during shaving. I wish the power button was higher up. But this isn&#x27;t a huge problem, just make sure you don&#x27;t press it while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor performed well during my first 2 shaving sessions. It seemed to cut better than my previous series of Braun razor (however to be fair I needed a new cutting blade on my old one). I didn&#x27;t have to make as many passes to get the smaller hairs below the chin which was easier on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning process, it very quiet. My previous cleaning base was very noisy when it would run the razor. I was happy about the minimal noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once last thing that I appreciate about this razor is that it has an A/C cord that can be used to run the razor if/when the batteries fail. I tend to take routine trips for 1+ weeks at a time and it always seemed that my previous razor would not cut as well when running of a battery that had been off the charger for a week. With the A/C cord on this new unit, I get full power which minimizes multiple passes and keeps the irritation on my face to a minimum. I also prefer the new carrying case to the old hard plastic case which had broken on my previous razor.was happy about the minimal noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once last thing that I appreciate about this razor is that it has an A/C cord that can be used to run the razor if/when the batteries fail.

    <li> The Braun 5090 is the first rechargeable shaver that I&#x27;ve ever been completely happy with!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an electric or rechargeable shaver of one brand or another for almost 20 years and I can honestly say that while many have done a passable or good job, the Braun 5090 that the company sent me to test is truly much better than any other that I have used.  From the first time, the flexible &amp;#34;MotionTec&amp;#34; head kept the foils in perfect alignment with my face, eliminating wasted time going over and over tough to shave areas on my neck and around my jaw to get a close shave.  You can also lock the head in position, but I haven&#x27;t found any reason to.&lt;br /&gt;While testing, I shaved on everything from a daily to a 4-day long weekend beard without having to pre-trim and always with the same excellent results.  The extra power motor and higher speed helps keep shave time to a minimum even for the heavier days.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is just the right size and shape to take care of straightening up around my goatee and mustache and the shaver does a good job right to the edges without pulling longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I&#x27;ve always struggled with is keeping the head feeling clean, but that definitely isn&#x27;t a problem with the Clean and Charge system.&lt;br /&gt;To tell the truth, I haven&#x27;t been able to test how long a charge will last, but I do know that I went 7 shaves without it even going below 4 bars (almost full) between charging at which point I wanted to try the cleaning cycle for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, the Braun 5090 is the best rechargeable shaver that I have ever used and I recommend it highly! All of the other features are very nice bonuses, but this shaver is the best that I have used, plain and simple.</li>
    <li> Received this razor as a sample from the company for my husband and it is the best rechargeable razor that he has ever used.  The shaver is better that most that are on the market today.  The life of the battery is excellent and the flexible head makes shaving easier and smoother.</li>
    <li> i received this razor as a sample product from Braun.  I love how it gives a clean close shave every time. I have used Braun products for years and this is by far the best razor.  It&#x27;s unique cleaning and charging system makes it feel like a new razor each time I use it.  It&#x27;s easy to charge and clean and less messy than cleaning a normal electric shaver. I would recommend this to any one, even those who don&#x27;t normally like electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I received this Braun Shaver Series 5 from the Company to try and review the product. Fantastic shaver! Love the pivoting head and how it glides smoothly over the curves of my neck without nicks or razor burns!  I love the automatic cleaning, it is so quiet and does a great job. In the past I have had to use both an electric &amp; disposable razor for the closeness, with this Braun Series 5 Razor it  provides a close, clean, comfortable shave and it is so light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would take 10 to 15 minutes using both an electric and disposable razor now only takes half of the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun for the GREAT product</li>
    <li> After using it for the first time I must say product is just as expected. I owned a Braun electric savor before and I must say I&#x27;m  satisfied as always. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great razor and very gentle on the face, and it&#x27;s not made in China.</li>
    <li> Okay when I read the reviews about these product I looked to see where these shaver was made I decided to buy because it&#x27;s a choice was made in Germany well when I received the package the product  it&#x27;s made in China so I&#x27;m going to return .  it&#x27;s expensive i&#x27;m not going to buy that expensive shaver made in China .</li>
    <li> My new Braun Series 5 replaces a Braun 8995 that survived daily usage for ten years with only needing the foil replaced every other year (I did have to replace the cradle after the cleaning solution pump failed). I’ve used the rotary style shavers from Remington and Norelco and definitely believe the Braun foil style is superior (at least for me). I’ve been using the new razor for about a month and I’m very pleased with it. The razor is clearly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold and manipulate while shaving. The new ability to “lock” the foil at a preferred angle is nice, but not one I really utilize as the motion is smooth enough to fit my facial contours w/o excessive pressure. The trimmer extension is smaller for finer cutting, although I somewhat prefer the old wider cutter (easier to maintain straight sideburns w/just a single cut, rather than lining up multiple cuts). The new style cleaning/charging stand is also quieter. The newer shaver doesn’t have the LCD screen like the older one does, but I don’t really miss it (does anyone need to know exactly how many seconds you spend shaving each day)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is very good, as you’d expect from brand new razor.  I normally shave immediately before showering and this razor does an excellent job delivering a close shave w/o tugging or pulling, including trimming next to facial hair. Minimal “recutting” is necessary for a very satisfactory result. Skin irritation is very minimal. I’m very happy with this product and look forward to it matching or exceeding its predecessor’s longevity.</li>
    <li> So I have been using the Braun Series 5090cc Electric Shaver for a few months now - I wanted to hold off before writing the review.  After using it for a bit, I can say that it&#x27;s probably one of the top shavers on the market.  It&#x27;s not as close as a shave with razor blade, but it does the job nicely.  It does have some very minor issues getting certain parts of my neck, but running over the area a few extra times works.  What I really like about it is the easy cleaning feature - the downside to this particular shaver is that you cannot use it in the shower.  I only give it 4 stars b/c there are better shavers out there, but for this price point, it&#x27;s well worth the buy.  Definitely a recommend/thumbs up if you are looking to spend aroud $200.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I have never used an electric razor AT ALL in my life because I have heard that they do not get as close of a shave as a straight razor. Well, the Braun 5 5090cc series razor proved my stereotype wrong. This razor really hugs my face well. I use the side-burn trimmer which works great when I go too many weeks without a haircut. I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to come with a built in cleaning system. Very convenient. I use it, wash off the detachable head, put it down into the cleaner, hit the button and it is ready for the next day. It looks great sitting on the bathroom counter. Looks like a sports car paint job. Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I received one of these to review from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used! Admittedly, it is a much nicer (more expensive) shaver than what I&#x27;m used to, but I love it! It gives me a good, close shave with no snags or nicks. The recharge and cleaning station are a great bonus as well! All in all, this is a great shaver that I am very happy with!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this razor. I am a bald man that shaves regularly and it curves to my head perfectly . Leaving me baby soft. It is easy to clean and the charge lasts a long time. I would definetly recommend this product!.</li>
    <li> Switched from a Panasonic ES8109 to the Braun 5090cc as my Panasonic was on its last breath. The Panasonic would always give me razor burn and cut my face when I used the trimmer. The cleaning system also broke, so I decided to buy a new electric shaver. After reading reviews from consumer reports and here, those led me to purchase this Braun product. I am pretty astonished at how smooth and non irritating the foils are, and it&#x27;s very simple to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this purchase, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new electric shaver</li>
    <li> Braun was nice enough to send me a razor to try and see how I liked it.  I have tried electric razors in the past.  The challenge I always have with them as that they don&#x27;t seem to get as close as a razor and there are parts of my face they really struggle with.  This razor is better but there are still spots (my chin and my neck) that don&#x27;t get shaved closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it cleans itself.  That is a nice feature but I am curious to see how long the cleaning solution lasts and how much it costs to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer did not work well at all.  I tried it on my sideburns and just below my nose and it barely did anything.  I will continue to try it  in case I am doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely saves time when compared to shaving with a regular razor.  Still not sure if the time saving overcomes the other shortcomings.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 5 5090 Clean &amp; Charge Shaver from the manufacturer to test out. From the moment you take it out of the box, the 5090 is impressive. For a gadget person like myself, it didn’t disappoint. The fit and finish of the razor is definitely high-end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just prior to using the Braun 5090, I used a regular, old-fashioned multi-blade razor. In a former life, I used an electric shaver from a competing company which I eventually left behind because I was unsatisfied with the trim, maintenance and upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 5090 (at least so far) takes all of my previous issues and complaints and nullifies them handsomely. After using the 5090 for more than a week, I’ve been very satisfied with the condition of my facial hair (or lack thereof). The handy built-in trimmer is a great feature as well. It just makes things so simple. And then there’s the cleaning and upkeep which, again, is pretty simple. The razor unit itself is high tech enough to tell me when it needs to be cleaned. The cleaning station is easy to use and doesn’t take up a metric ton bathroom countertop space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to have one complaint or quibble, it would be this: while the instructions for installing the cleaning solution into the cleaning station are very clear, it’s a bit difficult to get the plastic cap off of the cleaning solution and into the cleaning station unit without spilling at least a little bit. This is nothing that should prohibit anyone from buying this in any way – just something to take note of lest you end up wearing cleaning solution when it should instead be used to keep your sleek and shiny Braun 5090 fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> First off let me disclose that I have been using blades for most of my shaving life.  I kept trying different electric razors but none of them cut close enough to get approval from my wife.  I have tried various brands and none of them seemed to cut close enough.  I am one of those guys that shaves 2-3 times a week so I don’t grow facial hair quickly.  I get the feeling that most of these razors are meant for people with thicker facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised with how big the box was that the BRAUN SERIES 5 5090 CLEAN &amp; CHARGE came in.  The packaging is great and from the moment I opened the box I was able to tell that engineering behind this product was better than previous razors that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I started by using the razor as designed with the cleaner, I was surprised at how clean it is able to get the razor.  Over the process of 4 shaves I was able to determine that this razor cuts about as close as my blades do.  The cut was wife approved.&lt;br /&gt;I was going on vacation the next week so I took the razor with me.  It comes with a nice carrying case and I have been pleasantly surprised by how close it cuts on vacation.  Again, it is wife approved.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this razor.  I had no idea that electric razors could cut this close.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts closely, solid engineering, feels solid in your hand&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning station is a little big and takes up a lot of real estate.</li>
    <li> I received this Braun Series 5 5090 Clean &amp; Charge as  Bzz Agent from the manufacturer. I have never used an electric razor before and it was better than I imagined. A close shave every time. It is so easy to use and easy to keep clean. I was genuinely surprised at the results. No going back to a manual razor and shaving cream for me!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 5 5090 for a few weeks now and am thoroughly impressed.  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin is with zero irritation.  Coming from a lower end Bruan model that I had been using for a few years, I really didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning function is incredibly easy, just set it back into the charger and push the cleaning button.  The next time you use it, it will be like new.  Also, the function on the razor that tells how dirty it is works well if you don&#x27;t want to clean it every time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about the razor is the price.  I&#x27;m not sure the extra features are worth it.  Personally, the base model series 5 razor might be my first choice.  But I received this as a sample from Braun and have nothing but good things to say about it so far.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Braun for free to try. This razor is very nice. It shaves very smooth and clean. The razor doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and leaves a nice close shave that everyone loves. It moved very easy. The charge on this razor is terrific, I&#x27;ve used it several times a week for several weeks and it is just now starting to need charge. Great Razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been shaving with this razor for a couple of weeks but am very pleased so far.  Excellent close shave, that tilting head actually works, not just a meaningless whistle and bell, affordable replacement foil and blades and I like the powerful electric motor.  I&#x27;ve always had the best electric razors, expensive ones, from Panasonic, Norlco and others and this is the best of all so far.  If it holds up over time and you actually do get 18 months of good sharp blades before they need to be replaced I&#x27;ll be a happy camper indeed.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver, which replaced the Series 3 shaver I used for almost 5 years. The series 3 is still going but I retired  it as backup.&lt;br /&gt;The Series 5 5090cc is a significant improvement over the Series 3. The pivoting head is great and the shave is the best that I have ever obtained from any electric shaver. Very comfortable to handle,  and the cleaning cycle is a lot shorter than the Series 3.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the charging/cleaning cable is a little awkward/difficult to insert in the cleaner housing receptacle.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> I think I may have received a dud when it comes to the Braun Series 5 5090cc. The shaves are not close and leave an array of stubble. I literally have to take a straight razor and clean up after using my Braun. If I do not shave for two days then use my Braun it pull on hair like your were yanking them with a tweezer. Hurts like hell. Very disappointing for a Braun product. I wish I could return this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> best shaver ive had so far</li>
    <li> does everthing it says .</li>
    <li> Everything I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth it, and I&#x27;ve had $450 Brauns— sexy design, and a cleaner that makes sense. The other Brauns never really articulate why they&#x27;re better, and trust me: those $450 ones? They are made of cheap plastic base, just like Norelco&#x27;s, etc., too. Never locate any Braun charging stand where it might fall off near the edge of a dresser, etc.— and, keep in mind slightly cheaper models of this same sort appear not to have the touted charging base unit, so don&#x27;t be fooled into saving $30. My girlfriend likes it, too. ; )</li>
    <li> Braun sent me the Series 5 5090cc to try, and review for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this razor for a little over a month now and wanted to wait to write this review after I have had a chance to test it in many different situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by describing the type of beard that I have.  My beard is not the fullest beard as it takes me a few weeks to grow a beard that is not patchy.  The hair of my beard soft in the cheek areas and more coarse in the area that you would grow a goatee.  Due to the softness of my beard many electric razors have not worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test the razor out with many different lengths of stubble growth and surprisingly this razor did the job, and did it well, with any length of stubble I put in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I test this razor, but I had my best friend try it too.  He shaves his head and decided to use it on his head to see how close it got when comparing to a standard 3 blade razor.  He was happy with the closeness of the shave, although not as close as a 3 blade razor, it was close enough that he could go another 3 days without shaving his head versus 4 days between shaves with a 3 blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my displeasure my wife took this razor, without asking, into the shower to try and tackle her legs with it.  She said that it did the job for her and was a bit quicker than using her standard razor and almost as close of a shave.  At this point I thought the razor would never work the same again after it tackled the coarse hair that she has.  I was wrong, the razor works just like new after her use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning/lubricating system is wonderful.  After each use I will take the head off the razor and rinse under tap water and then brush the components on the razor.  I then will set it back in its charging/cleaning base and hit the clean button.  Somehow this cleaning system can detect the amount of cleaning that it needs.  If I use it to shave each day the cleaning cycle tends to be the shortest of the 3 cycles (about 60 seconds).  If I go a few days without a shave it will go into the middle cycle for cleaning (about 2 minutes).  Only after my wife used it on her legs did I see the deep clean cycle get used (about 3 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has been used well over 30 times now and it does not need a new cleaning cartridge as it is still less than half used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my past experiences with electric razors, I was not expecting to like this razor even though it was free.  I can honestly say that this razor has changed my mind about using electric razors and I will continue to use this over my standard razors.day the cleaning cycle tends to be the shortest of the 3 cycles (about 60 seconds).

    <li> I got this razor awhile back to try out and man I&#x27;m really happy I did get one. The battery last along time it&#x27;s easy to use and store. Gives a great shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin what so ever. I&#x27;ve had some in the past and this is by far the best one ive used. Great job Braun !</li>
    <li> I would like to share my review of the Braun Series 5 shaver that I received from Braun. I am going to review the shaver specifically and give some more detail in the use and charging. The cleaning center is going to be used and purchased to add to the convenience of the shaver. I really enjoyed using this shaver. It has a good feel in my hand and seems comfortable and stable to use. It gives a close shave which is great and has a good battery life. I am sure the charging station will help with cleaning but it seems like cleaning is pretty easy even without it. The flexible head gets close and the foil seems to give a closer shave than previously used circular blade style shavers.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long. After having received the Series 5 Shaver from Braun I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I was impressed upon opening the box by how nice it looked. Having never tried a decent electric shaver in my life I was almost nervous using something that looked and felt so nice. After using it for the past several weeks I have found myself wondering why I waited sooooo long to buy a nice razor. It feels awesome in your hand and you tell it is a quality built product when using. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is struggling to keep up and has more than enough power to do the job. The self cleaning makes it easy to maintain without being a hassle or worrying about keeping it clean. This comes the closest to using a regular razor that I have ever come across. For a nice smooth shaving experience I would highly recommend using this. It actually makes it a pleasure to shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and I like it</li>
    <li> Use this shaver everyday and it works great. I&#x27;ve several other shavers and this one is the best so far. Worth the money!!!</li>
