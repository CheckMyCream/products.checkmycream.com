      <li>Description of item (s) and details were accurate.</li>
      <li>in all, a great product that I will definitely be buying again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t replace actual brushing but for the moment its great.</li>
      <li>I wear invisalign and this product comes in handy when you really need to brush on the go.  </li>
      <li>It is the next best thing to a real toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Wisps are a convenient way to keep one&#x27;s teeth clean, even on the go.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t leave me feeling as clean as I would with a toothbrush</li>
      <li>Keeps your teeth clean and freshens up any odors from your meal.  </li>
      <li>I used them on my 10 day trip where i didn&#x27;t have access to clean water.</li>

      <li>They feel as close to the use of full toothbrush with toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I keep a cup full of dental floss picks and wisps by my bed.</li>
      <li>Not only smells good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool.</li>
      <li>What an ingenious idea; putting a bead of toothpaste on an itsy bitsy brush, making it disposable, and it even comes with a gentle pick for the crevices between your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time, I try to be ecologically responsible, staying away from one-use disposable products like these.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth feeling super clean, but works fine for in between meals or waking up from a nap, but certainly not in place of a good ol&#x27; brushing.</li>
      <li>Great when flying or other moments when you can&#x27;t brush your teeth.</li>

      <li>They leave my teeth feeling clean and breath fresh.</li>
      <li>Your saliva and tongue do a pretty fine job keeping your teeth</li>
      <li>Super for a freshening up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Going out for a date and want to have kissable breath?&lt;br /&gt;Bring some with you and hope you get lucky.</li>
      <li>You have to either have eaten something that easily attaches to your teeth or have teeth that tend to really attach to food.  </li>
      <li>The Brush / Freshener Part -The brush has firm bristles and clean my teeth very effectively.</li>
      <li>Using these instead would allow you to free up the space a tube of toothpaste would&#x27;ve taken up, and they&#x27;re very small/easy to pack elsewhere in your carry on instead.&lt;br</li>
      <li>:  Not as freshening as mouthwash, so if you&#x27;re looking to use this for fresh breath, you might want to carry both.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty darn cool.</li>
      <li>Fresh breath&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>And since I refuse to brush my teeth in a public bathroom, these come in extremely handy at work.</li>
      <li>Fresh mint taste as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried numerous brands, well known, and generic.These mini toothbrushes are better for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;*Quality! They feel as close to the use of full toothbrush with toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;*They leave a feeling of fresher breath &amp; cleaner teeth In ccomparison to the others.&lt;br /&gt;*The single packs makes them more sanitary, since you do not have to open, closeetc...a pack of 2 or 4.</li>
    <li> Great for travel teeth feel very clean. !</li>
    <li> These are handy to keep in your desk and use after lunch.  I would prefer the handle to be a little bit longer though, so the pointy tip doesn&#x27;t jab into your palm when you use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my recent trip to India.  I didn&#x27;t want to carry many liquids/gels due to air travel restrictions.  Great product in convenient packaging.</li>
    <li> I love these. I recently have been doing my best to keep my teeth and gums clean to reverse some of my periodontal disease. And since I refuse to brush my teeth in a public bathroom, these come in extremely handy at work. Trust me I could care less about someone talking about me while I use these at my desk, I sanitize my hand after (LOL). They leave my teeth feeling clean and breath fresh. There&#x27;s a handy pick at the end of the brush to remove any large debris. It can be a tad hard to reach the back teeth, but as long as you can give it a good once over, you&#x27;re good to go until your next brushing.</li>
    <li> I was, to say the least, wary of these things when I bought them. I mean, if you&#x27;ve grown up brushing your teeth the traditional way, it seems impossible for a little tiny thing to do the work of a regular toothbrush, and without water to boot. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these things at work after eating lunch and it&#x27;s amazing how clean and fresh my mouth feels after. The end can even be used as a toothpick for make-shift flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend them for traveling. With the 3-1-1 rule, it&#x27;s hard to fit all the liquids and gels you&#x27;ll need into one quart-sized bag. Using these instead would allow you to free up the space a tube of toothpaste would&#x27;ve taken up, and they&#x27;re very small/easy to pack elsewhere in your carry on instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product that I will definitely be buying again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that they make you salivate a lot, so you either have to swallow it all or find a place to spit it out. Since the only place I could spit it out while at work would be a sink, it sort of defeats the purpose of the waterless feature to do that, so I have to swallow it all instead. Not bad-tasting, but might be an issue for some. I docked one star for that.</li>
    <li> For me, I have found that this is the of most effective mini brush with pick that I have ever found. In fact, I depend on these brushes so much that I carry a couple of these in my purse so that when I am on the go, I can brush and freshen after a meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The Brush / Freshener Part -The brush has firm bristles and clean my teeth very effectively. The center part is the freshener/toothpaste part. Works well so that my teeth,gums and overall mouth feel very clean after I use this. Still I REGULAR BRUSH and floss at least 2 - 3 times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The Pick Part - Yes, the pick is a hard plastic, yet it is very thin and works just like a toothpick, yet better than a toothpick because there is no wood to break (I have broken so many toothpicks, so this is so so much better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Other Uses I Have Found - Twice a day, I use PLAX Rinse before brushing and then begin my regular brushing with this tiny brush as it has firm enough bristles to flake off the Plaque and even some tartar. (The PLAX Rinse takes at least 2 weeks to really see hard tartar coming off by the way - yet this firm brush seems to help the process for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Wisps are nice to keep around - I keep some in my car and some in my guest bathroom.  But for what they are, they&#x27;re kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> Bristles are kind of hard, but do a great job compared to my regular brush and taste is mild after use.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for traveling when you might not have access to fresh water.  I especially use them when camping.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as great as i had thought it would.  got these to take with me to the hospital when i delivered.  too stiff and the toothpaste didn&#x27;t get on my teeth as well as i had hoped.</li>
    <li> I am glad someone invented these -- I am never without them.  Briefcase, glove compartment, travel kit ... throw &#x27;em in.  Use once and discard -- no bacteria growth, no boiling water poured over the bristles.  It wouldn&#x27;t be right to use these for daily home brushing, but that&#x27;s not the intended application.</li>
    <li> I really love these mini brushes, they are amazing and fits in my bag.. I can brush anywhere and anytime I want</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep in bag, car, purse, etc for a quick clean mouth. Love to carry these on the planes when I travel.</li>
    <li> Quick and efficient! Pleasure doing business with them. Everything met my expectations. Description of item (s) and details were accurate.</li>
    <li> These work very well and are uber convenient to have in your desk drawer or in my case, my cargo pocket.  I used these as I traveled around Afghanistan.  When you waiting for a flight, its nice to be able to clean your teeth conveniently.  These work like a charm.</li>
    <li> These are perfect to take along while traveling. Even though it&#x27;s common to get a toothbrush on an overnight flight, going into an airplane bathroom to brush your teeth can be a daunting prospect. So I keep a few of these handy on my long trips. They don&#x27;t leave me feeling as clean as I would with a toothbrush but they come close, and getting that feeling of refreshment can be invaluable at times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not what anyone would consider an ultra-light backpacker, though I try to be somewhat conscious of my pack-weight. That being said, I think these things are perfect for backpacking and camping. No need to fuss with a tube of toothpaste, they take up very little space, weigh basically nothing, and these are easily packed out in a zip-lock plastic bag. My only complaint about these little wonders is that I wish they were just a half an inch or so longer... Man, is it hard to reach my back molars!!! I feel like I&#x27;m going to swallow the darn thing in the effort! Other than that, they&#x27;re great, in my opinion. The toothpick back is a nice added feature, too.</li>
    <li> Bought these because i am on the invisalign treatment for the next few months and they already saved me a few times. Doesn&#x27;t replace actual brushing but for the moment its great.</li>
    <li> This mini tooth brush works great if you are out on the road for lunch.  It easily cleans your teeth.</li>
    <li> Individually wrapped disposable brushes. I used them on my 10 day trip where i didn&#x27;t have access to clean water. Love them.</li>
    <li> I have a monthly subscription from Amazon for these things.  End of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit It&#x27;s a little weird to brush your teeth in public but it&#x27;s way worse to have monkey breath.  So do it in the car but take all necessary precautions.  The other end of this thing is a very sharp point for cleaning between your teeth and I&#x27;d hate to see what would happen if you had one of these things in your mouth and an airbag went off in your face.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your mouth feeling very clean after using them&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient to not have to use water or be near a sink.&lt;br /&gt;-Very quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Saves me in emergencies when my breath is horrid and I can&#x27;t get home to brush&lt;br /&gt;-Flavor is very good (peppermint)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Seems kind of expensive at 44 cents each. Probably easier just to buy a travel toothbrush but not as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles are very stiff and sometimes make my gums bleed. I have sensitive gums though. Didn&#x27;t make my coworkers mouth bleed.&lt;br /&gt;-While these are refreshing, I am wondering if they are actually &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; your teeth or just making your mouth smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most likely buy these again just for emergencies but would not use them daily at work. It would get very expensive compared to buying a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty darn cool. The &amp;#34;freshening bead&amp;#34; is toothpaste, and it&#x27;s really a tiny brush. It has a pointy end you can use as a toothpick. It&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found for these little life savers. I keep them in my purse, car, desk at home and work and extras to give to someone in need. Since they&#x27;re an add on item I just get two bags whenever I order from Amazon. Great stocking stuffers.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just the ticket when you need to freshen your breath and clean your teeth until you can get to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I am addicted. So much better than chewing gum</li>
    <li> With the bristles and pick, these Wisps are great for cleaning teeth immediately after meals or as a temporary toothbrush substitute. They are so portable that you can carrying them in your purse or pocket and have them on hand when you need them. Food tends to get stuck in my teeth when I eat, so I like using the pic to get out the food particles and then the brush to get rid of that sort of food &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; that&#x27;s left on my teeth after eating. The pic fits great between my teeth and I have some tight spaces between some of my teeth. The bristles are plastic; strong enough to brush away food residue but not so stiff as too irritate my gums. The freshening bead tastes fine (I like the peppermint or cinnamon) and it does make my mouth feel fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the Wisps are not individually packaged within the 16-count bag.</li>
    <li> Tiny dot of toothpaste style gel that is so hard to rupture.  When it finally does rupture, it is far too little to actually be of any benefit.  Also the bristles are TOO flexible that they can&#x27;t help do any sort of real brushing.  I&#x27;m definitely going back to a standard toothbrush and travel toothpaste for my office supply kit now.</li>
    <li> My kids use these on the go, hotel stays, after a smelly lunch at school, etc.  There&#x27;s always a few in their bookbags, my purse, and their lockers at school.  Super for a freshening up. Not only smells good but you actually feel clean, too. Tiny, discreet, but packs a punch</li>
    <li> I brought three bags of this , unfortunately all are expired in Jan 2014 and now we in September 2014 . 👎</li>
    <li> as close to brushing your teeth as you&#x27;ll get!!</li>
    <li> My brother put these in his wedding gift bags and I was hooked then after using it once.  Pick and brush in one that is disposable.  This is one of those things you wish you invented.  Wife loves them.  Goes everywhere with them.</li>
    <li> Just bring a toothbrush where you&#x27;re going, you guys. They even make those mini ones that fold in half. Use that if you&#x27;re traveling. Bring gum or a certs if you&#x27;re thinking of these as a breath freshener. I&#x27;m surprised by the number of good reviews here - I can&#x27;t make my mouth feel clean with one of these, the bristles are tiny and rough and dumb. The center is weird and not a replacement for toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want coffee breath before meeting someone?&lt;br /&gt;Leave some in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t want garlic breath for your big meeting?&lt;br /&gt;Leave some in your desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going out for a date and want to have kissable breath?&lt;br /&gt;Bring some with you and hope you get lucky.</li>
    <li> Great when flying or other moments when you can&#x27;t brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> I carry these around in my car and now have the cleanest teeth at any given red light. (I have tinted windows.)</li>
    <li> Can freshen at any time any place to let you feel very positive at next meeting with others. Just place in your pocket and you&#x27;re ready for any lunch.</li>
    <li> I put these in my purse and suitcase to use when I can&#x27;t brush. They are strong and work just as well as regular brushing</li>
    <li> I bought these as part of the Amazon Add-on Program and am happy I did. Stores may sell these in 2 or 4 pack but can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s 16 pack price and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wisps work great and small enough to carry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lying in bed, warm and comfortable. I&#x27;m not going to get up and go brush my teeth at this point. I keep a cup full of dental floss picks and wisps by my bed.</li>
    <li> These little things always come in handy when your out and about and dont have access to brush your teeth.  Perfect for when you go on a date and want to have fresh brath.  Fresh mint taste as well.</li>
    <li> These do help out in a pinch. But do not compare to the real thing. I am glad i have them for those no other choice times.</li>
    <li> what a lifesaver!!!  I wear invisalign and this product comes in handy when you really need to brush on the go.  plus, a great price vs. what you find at other local retailers.</li>
    <li> Great product for a quick touch-up. I wish the pick end would taper down to a finer point. Good for travel, your desk or your car.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a little small to be really effective...but I will keep a few in my travel bag just for freshening up.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again when I run out of them.</li>
    <li> I buy these with &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; and I love it. I keep them in my car and purse for whenever I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> I love these mini brushes.  They are great for cleaning you teeth after a meal when you can&#x27;t get to a toothbrush or you don&#x27;t feel like getting up to go brush.  They do a really good job of cleaning your teeth and making your mouth feel fresh. It is the next best thing to a real toothbrush.</li>
    <li> excellent product for on the go days! mouth is fresh always</li>
    <li> I had the best lunch today.&lt;br /&gt;But now the smell won&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;My coworkers are refusing to play.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s because of my bad breath they say.&lt;br /&gt;And so to the Colgate gods I pray!&lt;br /&gt;My bad breath they do slay.&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Wisp Mini-Brush - HOORAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these bad boys.  They are absolute life savers.  I keep a few in my purse at all times whenever a bad breath occasion arises.  Aside from being able to quickly brush your teeth they have a little pick on the other side to help with any food particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for anyone who interacts with other people on a daily basis.  No, it won&#x27;t take the place of actually brushing your teeth, but it will help make your day go a little smoother.... and who doesn&#x27;t need that?</li>
    <li> Great for quick teeth cleaning anywhere.  Leaves mouth fresh, teeth clean.  Good variety of flavours.  Have used now for 3 years</li>
    <li> I first discovered water free, disposable tooth brushes at a bus stop in the UK and these are much better!  After a lunch out or to freshen up during a date they are perfect.  The plastic bristles polish your teeth and the blue bead in the middle breaks as you brush, refreshing your breath.  Not a substitute for a real toothbrush though!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for use after meals!  Keeps your teeth clean and freshens up any odors from your meal.  These 16 count packs are all individually packaged brushes so you can carry one or two in your pocket during lunch breaks.</li>
    <li> I keep them in my car and use them every day after drinking my coffee on the way to work.</li>
    <li> Very nice mini-brushes. Does it purpose considering the size.&lt;br /&gt;We used it as little extra perks for our guests in a convention and they loved it.</li>
    <li> What an ingenious idea; putting a bead of toothpaste on an itsy bitsy brush, making it disposable, and it even comes with a gentle pick for the crevices between your teeth.  I especially like that every brush is in a small, sealed package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take these on long trips--such as on overseas flights, when carrying a brush, toothpaste, floss, and a pick are just too much to handle with today&#x27;s TSA-restrictive travel rules.  There&#x27;s just enough there to do the job.  And when you arrive, your mouth feels clean and smells minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Too bad someone hasn&#x27;t figured out how to create a shower in a tiny package!</li>
    <li> What a great idea!  I discovered this product when I was on a business trip and had forgotten my toothbrush.  There is no water necessary, no rinsing necessary, and they take up almost no space at all.  Since I&#x27;ve discovered these I keep a stash in my briefcase and in my desk drawer.  Eat what ever you&#x27;d like at lunch and don&#x27;t worry that the onions you asked for on the sub are going to be an issue at your 1:00 meeting afterwards!  You can brush your teeth without any water, and you don&#x27;t have to rinse afterwards - though I usually do.  Quick, easy and a really great idea.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I rely on these little wisps for oral freshness on the go. I travel frequently and brushing teeth is not always doable. Individually wrapped, the little brushes keep your teeth clean and your breath fresh. One side is the brush and the other is a pick which helps remove food from your teeth.The flavor is invigorating. These refreshing little brushes make it easy to maintain dental hygiene on the road. These are great for travel, school, camping or other activity where traditional brushing is not practical. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth feeling super clean, but works fine for in between meals or waking up from a nap, but certainly not in place of a good ol&#x27; brushing. Does freshen the breath quite nicely though.</li>
    <li> If I have a meeting, and just got done eating lunch, I do a once over with these and I feel refreshed as ever.</li>
    <li> These are great for if I go out to eat. Make my mouth feel clean and refreshed and me more confident for anything I do afterwards that my breath isnt unbearable.</li>
    <li> I love these! They get food out of your teeth, they whiten your teeth, freshen your breath, and taste good and are fun to use on the go!</li>
    <li> I have used wisps before. They were packaged four to a pack. I like the wisp mini-brush because they are separate. You can take just the right amount with you.</li>
    <li> These little wisps are a great addition to your purse - smaller than a toothbrush, but still do the trick between brushings or after a drink that might stain, like coffee or red wine.  You&#x27;ll pay several dollars a piece for these in the store, as they&#x27;re typically sold in 2 or 4 packs, making this 16-count pack a really great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not as freshening as mouthwash, so if you&#x27;re looking to use this for fresh breath, you might want to carry both.  Also, I wish these were individually shrinkwrapped so you don&#x27;t have to carry the entire cardboard holder in your bag.</li>
    <li> Wisps are one of my favorite things ever! Love them &amp; carry them with me everywhere - I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
    <li> These are only really useful in certain scenarios.  You have to either have eaten something that easily attaches to your teeth or have teeth that tend to really attach to food.  I bought them for a vacation where I knew I&#x27;d be away from the hotel room all day and so would be eating multiple meals every day without access to my toothbrush and no idea in advance what I&#x27;d be eating.  The few times I did feel compelled to use them, they did their job well.  They are individually packaged in a relatively easy to open format which is handy.  The pick on the end is also convenient.  Overall, they are very good for what they are meant for which is really just to help out in between proper brushings.</li>
    <li> Wisps are a convenient way to keep one&#x27;s teeth clean, even on the go.  I stash them in the car, in my purse, in my tote bag,---just about everywhere!</li>
    <li> I keep these in my car because I sometimes eat while driving. Nothing like an actual toothbrush and contrary to what I first thought that blue bead in the middle is not toothpaste type stuff, it is more like a breath mint. Scope Outlast makes some that I like a bit better but are harder to find. These work well enough that I continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> Great for on-the-go cleaning</li>
    <li> I very much like these, and plan to keep them handy in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to admit it but sometimes I&#x27;m so busy I forget or simply neglect to brush and floss. When it finally dawns on my, I&#x27;m usually already in my car on my way to work.  When this happens, I pull one of these out. It is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Fresh breath&lt;br /&gt;2. Pick works well for stimulating gum line (a decent substitute for flossing)&lt;br /&gt;3. Bristles are soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Brushing your \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; is really about gently brushing your gums, stimulating the bacteria that tries to collect right on the edge and just underneath where, if left undisturbed (by brushing and flossing), it will harden and create a gap. If you didn&#x27;t already know this, ask your dentist. Your saliva and tongue do a pretty fine job keeping your teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to floss.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> A must have for my purse at all times. A great invention and I hope they keep making them. You can brush in a bathroom stall!!</li>
    <li> excellent for on the run,no need for wayer, best jimmy mack</li>
    <li> We had used these before to carry on the long airplane flights when we just needed a quick brushing after a meal. It&#x27;s easier than carry a traveling toothbrush &amp; tootpaste in the carry on bag. We had not used them in a while until my wife got her Invsialign braces and needed something to get the grime off her teeth before putting them back in while out eating. The ability to use them without water or needing to rinse was exactly what she was needing until she could get somewhere &amp; brush properly. They are handy to have anytime you just need to freshen up a little and don&#x27;t have a bathroom near by.</li>
    <li> Most of the time, I try to be ecologically responsible, staying away from one-use disposable products like these.  In this case, we were traveling to a developing country and spending long hours on trains and needed a back-up in case there were no hygienic facilities for using a regular toothbrush.  Glad I took these along.  They work well, considering the tiny brush head, but the handle was a little too short for doing a good job on the back teeth.  Until a better alternative comes along, I&#x27;d recommend these to someone in a similar situation.</li>
