      <li>but I don&#x27;t itch any more.  </li>
      <li>Sure it takes more time</li>
      <li>and I prefer thicker and more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice light lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like lemon or cucumbers.</li>
      <li>I love all of their products</li>
      <li>The dispenser heads have been hit or miss for me, but all of them work, even on the ones where the top doesn&#x27;t pop up like the others.</li>

      <li>As most other reviewers here agree, this is a delightful, quality lotion that is priced nicely for the amount you get.</li>

      <li>Very rich but not greasy.</li>
      <li>LEAVES SKIN SO SOFT , SMELLS WONDERFUL, GREAT FOR EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE FAMILY.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
      <li>Okay, not bad!</li>
      <li>Regardless, it&#x27;s still a great, affordable, natural lotion.</li>
      <li>Very quickly absorbs by the skin.</li>
      <li>I like how it goes on so smoothly and easily.  </li>
      <li>The good:&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free, polysorbate free, cruelty free, yada yada.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy...</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t linger too much and the lotion feels amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, though, so</li>
      <li>I got it for dry skin in the winter and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around.  </li>
      <li>--- I like how it&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs really quick.</li>
      <li>This lotion keeps my skin soft without greasiness and I love that the bottle is huge.  </li>
      <li>Love this brand and wanted to try a new scent.</li>
      <li>Both go on very well and go into your skin very quickly</li>
      <li>Nothing like fresh cucumber.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not a thick lotion, so it applies easily and absorbs quick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To me it smells like a fresh, crisp, sliced jalape&amp;ntilde;o.</li>
      <li>I am a female and I do think this is a more suitable scent for a male.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unusual, however.</li>
      <li>To me it smells very much like pickles.</li>
      <li>So far as moisturizing goes, it&#x27;s perfectly fine -</li>
      <li>I love this lotion and the price for the enormous bottle.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>The scent is only okay, though.  </li>
      <li>It smells exactly like cucumber and lemon, no fake smells about it.</li>
      <li>You can find a better quality lotion at your local grocery store.</li>
      <li>Well, I saw this and at first said hhmmm...</li>
      <li>You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face.</li>
      <li>One pump easily covers an entire leg.  </li>
      <li>You get a lot for your money it is a large container.</li>
      <li>nice but could be a little thicker</li>
      <li>The texture of the lotion is nice and smooth without being to runny however the smell to me is a little off putting when initially applying the lotion.</li>
      <li>My wife thinks the whole bathroom smells after I apply it.  </li>
      <li>Your mileage may very.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much and my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy after I use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not off putting, but I expected better from the title: cucumber lemon.</li>
      <li>so I have gotten into the habit of putting lotion on my whole body.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>smell is too much though.</li>
      <li>It is a clean scent and not unpleasant, just not fantastic, either.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion because it is moisturizing without being sticky, and it has natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, while it is light and doesn&#x27;t linger, it&#x27;s certainly not a scent you&#x27;d want to have linger.  </li>
      <li>So far, I like it.</li>
      <li>You may want to smell it at a local store before purchasing it out right online, it&#x27;s a big jug.</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
      <li>Still, it rates as one of the least strong scents in the line that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Most likely I will never use it because of the strong weird small and will end up tossing the whole thing away.</li>
      <li>So I usually order the big name brands that are Organic and Free of all the crap/chemicals.</li>
      <li>I will say that I felt that the lotion was a bit thin and that is why I gave it four out of five, but I would surely buy it again.</li>
      <li>Also, this brand is known for being lower on the organ toxicity scale than a whole lot of other bath products; that alone makes it purchase-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the product. The scent is a little too intense for my taste but willing to try other scents.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very quickly absorbs by the skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible!! Maybe some guys might like this scent but it was terrible for me. Nothing like fresh cucumber.</li>
    <li> I love all of their products</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell of it.  It&#x27;s very strong and overwhelming.  Not a good smell, imo.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion because it is moisturizing without being sticky, and it has natural ingredients. It has a nice, pleasant smell that is not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s labeled for men, everyone in our family uses it and loves it!</li>
    <li> So far as moisturizing goes, it&#x27;s perfectly fine - I&#x27;ve used Everyone Lotion before and really liked it - but the smell of this one is awful.  It&#x27;s so lemony and spicy, like there&#x27;s pepper in it, like muddled lemons and jalapeños in a cocktail.  Thought I&#x27;d get used to it, but after a month, the smell is still irritating; I should have returned it when I had the chance.</li>
    <li> The texture of the lotion is nice and smooth without being to runny however the smell to me is a little off putting when initially applying the lotion. If the smell was better I would rate it a 5.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Everything you want in a lotion this is. Very rich but not greasy. Soft scent not overwhelming, and spreads well. Great option for everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and wanted to try a new scent. Cucumber and Lemon sounded great for the summer! Disappointed as to how subtle the scent is...VERY subtle. It is meant for men, so maybe my husband will use it. Still a great product, just don&#x27;t expect it to smell as great as some of this companies other products</li>
    <li> This lotion keeps my skin soft without greasiness and I love that the bottle is huge.  The scent is only okay, though.  It reminds me a bit of artificial grass scent mixed with bottled lemon juice.  It is a clean scent and not unpleasant, just not fantastic, either.</li>
    <li> LEAVES SKIN SO SOFT , SMELLS WONDERFUL, GREAT FOR EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE FAMILY.&lt;br /&gt;NOT JUST FOR MEN , THE SCENT IS GREAT FOR WOMEN TOO.... I LOVE IT....&lt;br /&gt;BROUGHT IT FOR MY SON , AND ENDED UP LIKING IT FOR MYSELF !</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money it is a large container. I ordered both flavors. Both go on very well and go into your skin very quickly it is not greasy at all and leaves your skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;BUT the fragrance of both I do not like at all. BOTH have a grassy smell not fresh mowed grass but wet grass. I can not smell any lemon or cedar in either product. I ONLY USE AT NIGHT BEFOR GOING TO BED. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BOTHER \\&quot;BETTY BOOP\\&quot;, MY DOG. I WOULD NEVER GO OUT WEARING IT DURING THE DAY</li>
    <li> This is great lotion at an amazing value.  I got it for dry skin in the winter and it works great.  The scent is good for a man and I did not have any breakouts when applied to my face.</li>
    <li> Bottle came with cracked pump so I never got to use it .</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I don&#x27;t have to use much and my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy after I use it.</li>
    <li> Came just in time. The smell is a very herbal like smell but very nice :)</li>
    <li> Very poor quality lotion.  The moisture does not last all day.  I have pretty dry skin so I am always looking for good quality lotion.  My skin is dry and scaly before the end off the day after applying this.  This is my second try with this brand of lotion, both where different scents, and neither off them lasted through the day.  Also, this scent is pretty bad, almost a dirt smell.  My wife thinks the whole bathroom smells after I apply it.  This is neither a good or manly scent.  Even though you do get a big bottle for the price, it&#x27;s definitely not worth it.  You can find a better quality lotion at your local grocery store.</li>
    <li> So I usually order the big name brands that are Organic and Free of all the crap/chemicals. Well, I saw this and at first said hhmmm...but then I decided to give it a try and upon using it, ehhh....I like it. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Is it the best? No. Is it better than ANY of the lotions you&#x27;d buy loaded with junk/chemicals? Yes. -- So bottom line, it&#x27;ll do the job and it does have good ingredients. Is it perfect? No. But it works. --- I like how it&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs really quick. The scent is so-so and why it says for men? I don&#x27;t know LOL. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s musky or anything. So if you like cucumber and lemon, fire away. Enjoy...</li>
    <li> this goes on so smoothly, The fragrance is very subtle which is guess is why it says it&#x27;s for men, BUT I&#x27;m a lady</li>
    <li> smells like pledge intially, good lotion. smell is too much though. not sure if i&#x27;d buy again. might try a different scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, while it is light and doesn&#x27;t linger, it&#x27;s certainly not a scent you&#x27;d want to have linger.  The application is very light, I suppose that&#x27;s what you get when you try to incorporate a body lotion with a face lotion, it&#x27;s just not going to work.  However, you get a lot for your money... so, it&#x27;s a good value?  I guess that&#x27;s all the praise I can give.</li>
    <li> Okay, not bad! The smell for me is alright. I might buy this again sometime. You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face. Thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased for my boyfriend because he is concerned about his skin.  He uses it regularly and enjoys it.  The smell is pleasant and not overpowering the way most men&#x27;s dedicated products are.</li>
    <li> It smells exactly like cucumber and lemon, no fake smells about it. Great lotion. Highly recommend it. Not full of chemicals. ;)</li>
    <li> Very good lotion. On par with the top lotions at any store. Smell is nice and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
    <li> Although described as cucumber and lemon, I&#x27;m inclined to call the scent just cucumber.  Still, it rates as one of the least strong scents in the line that I&#x27;ve tried.  And I think the lotion itself is great, and a great value overall.  The dispenser heads have been hit or miss for me, but all of them work, even on the ones where the top doesn&#x27;t pop up like the others.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and the price for the enormous bottle. The scent is not incredible. It&#x27;s not off putting, but I expected better from the title: cucumber lemon. I am a female and I do think this is a more suitable scent for a male. It&#x27;s also a lighter lotion and I prefer thicker and more moisturizing. It was the 3rd I bought of this brand (I prefer the lemon coconut and the lavendar which are thicker and delicious smells). Regardless, it&#x27;s still a great, affordable, natural lotion. Love it!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes decently enough, but the smell is not good. It&#x27;s cheap, though, so there&#x27;s that... Wouldn&#x27;t buy this scent again, however.</li>
    <li> As most other reviewers here agree, this is a delightful, quality lotion that is priced nicely for the amount you get. The scent, however, has blown their minds. Let me say, this does not smell anything like lemon or cucumber, IMO. To me it smells like a fresh, crisp, sliced jalape&amp;ntilde;o. I actually like it. It&#x27;s very unusual, however. Your mileage may very. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I have gotten into the habit of putting lotion on my whole body.  Sure it takes more time but I don&#x27;t itch any more.  Other lotions go on thick and are hard to spread.  This one is lighter and nit greasy.  One pump easily covers an entire leg.  I like how it goes on so smoothly and easily.  The smell has a hunt of cedar which is just ok.  In fact there is another variety of this brand that is cedar scented so perhaps the smell is just natural for their base ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my guy, we are trying to  get better lotions without parabens.  He didn&#x27;t even want to use it because of the smell, I lied and said I liked it and he should just keep using it.  After a week he said he still doesn&#x27;t like the smell (I hate it too) but it doesn&#x27;t linger too much and the lotion feels amazing he said so he will keep using it.  Cucumber and Lemon does nto describe the smell, its like a weird herbal grass smell. But it works.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free, polysorbate free, cruelty free, yada yada.  Also, this brand is known for being lower on the organ toxicity scale than a whole lot of other bath products; that alone makes it purchase-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a thick lotion, so it applies easily and absorbs quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;It stinks.. it really stinks.  It smells almost like you rolled around in some weird dead grass. Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around.  I can only smell it while I am applying it. I use Everyone body wash products exclusively and have always found their smells to be pleasant so I wasn&#x27;t concerned when I ordered this. You may want to smell it at a local store before purchasing it out right online, it&#x27;s a big jug.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it. It seems to work and its good that I can use it on my face too. Its a pain to have different lotions for different needs. Just use this when you get out of the shower and that&#x27;s all you need. I will say that I felt that the lotion was a bit thin and that is why I gave it four out of five, but I would surely buy it again.</li>
    <li> nice but could be a little thicker</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice light lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like lemon or cucumbers. To me it smells very much like pickles. I ordered it without having tried it. Mistake. Most likely I will never use it because of the strong weird small and will end up tossing the whole thing away. Or maybe I can try it on a hamburger.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought the kind for men. This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue ordinarily except it reeks like tobacco. So gross.</li>
