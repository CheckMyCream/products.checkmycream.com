<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you&#x27;re alergic to strong fragrances, especially fake smells, these will definitely make you sneeze!  They&#x27;re made in China, so buyer beware.  I tried using a bar, but had to toss it and will donate the rest to charity.  Hopefully, someone will like them.  What I was actually looking for was small travel soaps, but everything on Amazon is either too large or has too much fragrance.  Any suggestions?  I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of anything scented with Sandalwood, and this soap is no exception to the rule. While I personally love the way this smells and the way I smell after using it, please be aware that if you are sensitive to strong smells or perfumes this may not be the soap for you as it is quite fragrant.    It may take me a while to work through 12 bars, but I do hope it is still available when I am ready to re-order.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of sandalwood you will love this soap. Great smell and rich lather. We have bought this exact product in Chinatown in San Francisco 25 years ago, had forgotten about it over the years since it isn&#x27;t in stores. Great to get re-aquainted&lt;br /&gt;with the product.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years now. Fragrance is superb, lathers well, gentle on the skin. Even use it on my face.</li>
    <li> MOVED UP HEAR TO ALASKA , AND THIS SOAP IS SO HARD TO FIND, SO THINKING ALL DAY IT HIT ME..AMAZON! AND YES I FOUND IT! EXCELENT QUALITY SERVICE SUPER...THANK YOU AMAZON.COM</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite soaps since I was in college. Inexpensive and actually smells like sandalwood. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells divine.  Have not used it, but makes the cabinet smell great.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend &amp; did not disappoint.  I shared with a friend who was very happy to try &amp; enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Happy with the service and the product.</li>
    <li> I am conflicted with making this product fall short of 5 stars, but heres my case. The soap does smell very good but when you near 3/4 of the bar it loses almost any trace of scent. So your left washing yourself with a scentless soap block (weird). But for the $ this is well worth it! If your on the fence I recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance, gentle on my skin. Wrapped bars are like sachets...my linen closet, where I store them always welcomes me with their fragrance. I use these soaps daily as my bath soap, and also give them as little gifts. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> From the moment I took the raper off the smell of the soap filled the bathroom.  The smell subsided some after being used yet it leaves my hands smelling nice.</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVE THIS SOAP!!!!!!!!!  12 Hours later and I still smell like sandalwood!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years because it&#x27;s generally wonderful but received my current box of 12 and it&#x27;s NOT what I&#x27;ve used in the past!  The new shipment smells like cheap motel soap.  Very disappointed that I now have to find a new brand of soap.  Beware this may not be the product you&#x27;re used to.</li>
    <li> Great product, we love this soap!  Would buy again, good bargain!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for years myself.  However, I get it at my local Chinese/Thai ethnic store and the latest price tag is $5.79.  It is a fairly long drive for me, but if you don&#x27;t have a good ethnic shopping district, you might just have to pay these Amazon prices.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves flowers and bees sandal wood soap! it smells really really good and not the over scented synthetic smell you would get with other sandal wood soaps.  And it&#x27;s really great for acne prone skin, my daughter&#x27;s face cleared up using this soap only, and she hasn&#x27;t used any other soap for her face since then.  We also put this on the cabinet for storage along with the socks , handkerchief and lingeries, and the sandal wood scent would cling to the the fabric.. and voila an instant fabric freshener!  You&#x27;ll never regret buying this soap i tell you all!</li>
    <li> Great scet and lather! Leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. (i was missing a bar...i only recieved 11 bars)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price for a lot of good soap, however it leaves brownish orange stains all over your sink, shower floor, etc. I like the scent, I like the soap, but it leaves the bathroom looking nasty.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife . She is happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like that there were a large number of soaps in this purchase. The paper that held the soap is also unique. It gives it a special look. The scent was nice for sandal wood. The odor was not too strong or heavy. This soap product simply was good at cleaning. I would recommend that you may need to moisturize after using this product. While it did not dry out my skin or harm my complexion, it did pull out oils of the skin. Overall, a nice soap with a light scent. I liked this purchase</li>
    <li> Has a sophisticated scent and a nice lather, a nice change from florals.  The packaging make them a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Long acting and wonderful scent, I buy this soap regularly and have always enjoyed using it.  Will continue to purchased this product from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, gentle, refreshing soap with a delightfully clean scent.  I have been using it for many years.  It is my favorite soap of all time!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT AND I WAS TOLD TO SAY VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I didn&#x27;t think it was enough of sandalwood scent, and it didn&#x27;t lather as much. The bars are small. So, I don&#x27;t think I will buy the other scents.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice soap, with a delightful sandalwood scent that could be a bit stronger.  Best of all, it comes in the hard to find size that is just right for a hand soap.  Nice and sudsy, but does not dissolve in the soap dish like some sudsy soaps do.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful long lasting soap. It&#x27;s scent is good for men to use too. I&#x27;ve never broken out from the soap either. I have had a trouble with other brands. It comes packaged pretty enough to give as gifts. It has now become the only soap I use. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a kiss of sandalwood to my skin and I love it&#x27;s moisturizing qualities. I have given this product as a gift, with love.</li>
    <li> I keep it in the wrapper and use it in drawers and storage boxes.  The smell lasts for years but is not overwhelming.  I have used it in the bath before and it lathers up nicely but since I am not entirely sure of the ingredients not sure if I would use it every day for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I was misled by the good reviews and bought an unknown product only to regret. The fragrance and the lather are underwhelming.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! If you love the smell of cheap hotel soap that smells nothing like sandalwood. Highly disappointed. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This soap is no longer what it used to be. My wife hates it. The scent is really weird, really.</li>
    <li> used to have more scent.  still nice.</li>
    <li> So, the floral undertone of most soaps turns into a flowery funk when combined with my body chemistry. Plus, I have very sensitive skin and many soaps make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother used to have this soap when I was a child, and she would let me use it. I figured, if it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin then, maybe it&#x27;s worth a try now. I&#x27;ve not been disappointed. It lathers great, smells great, leaves me feeling clean, and does not make me itch. Plus, I got plenty of it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENT. The sandalwood scent is very present, but it is not strong. This is not like Irish Spring or some other soap that will leave you strongly prefumed. Sandalwood is not generally very strong smelling. The smell of the soap changes over time. Right now, the soap smells like fresh, woody, spicy sandalwood. But, my mother&#x27;s soaps were lighter and more powdery smelling because she had them for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this soap on my face.</li>
    <li> My mother used to buy this back in the &#x27;70&#x27;s so I was glad to find this in bulk on Amazon. I used it as stocking stuffers and everyone loves it. Good to stash in drawers to freshen up lingerie. Bars are on smallish side so nice for small hands or to use in guest bath.</li>
    <li> She likes the scent and the wrappings of the bars of soap, but not the fact that they are made in China.</li>
    <li> I use these small bars for bathroom vanities. Not the best sandalwood scent, but then the price was very modest.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I no longer have to go to Chinatown to try to find these.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in the late 80&#x27;s from my local health food store.  Rediscovered it on Amazon, and also rediscovered how much I love the scent.  Improves my mood, especially after a stressful day.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it could be drying my skin a LITTLE, but not enough to counter the mood improvement I experience.</li>
    <li> The delivery was expeditious and before the time of stated delivery. I love this soap bar it smells great and the scent is long lasting I can hours without deo and still smell amazingly fresh. Not trying to sound all infomercial but this soap is what&#x27;s up especially for African Americans. This soap not only brighten my skin but it also seem to be rejuvenating &amp; strengthening my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this soap since i was a little girl. This is my family soap.. This soap works great, didn&#x27;t dry up my skin.</li>
    <li> Will reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> No soap is as beautifully scented and gentle as this.  Fast shipping.  Thanks.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful, and keeps it&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> The product meet my expectation , but the packaging was poor</li>
    <li> For me its THE BEST...hard meld, long lasting, sexy scent...love it for guys especially....beautifully packaged and a real quality product. Been using it for 40 years and have requests alway for MORE..</li>
    <li> Hands down, my favorite soap. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find, so I&#x27;m thrilled I can get it on amazon.</li>
    <li> really smells bad.  I read the earlier reviews of inconsistent scent and some stinky ones.  I thought maybe they might not represent the majority of the orders.  I was wrong.  The order of 10 bars all of which smelled very strongly of chemicals was my proof that the earlier reports were correct.&lt;br /&gt;Not withstanding my experience in Indonesia with this brand which was very nice, I don&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap, has a terrific fragrance and last a good while also.  Came packed in box that is great for stacking and storing easily on shelf</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Smells luscious and the aroma lingers for hours.</li>
    <li> Liked this enough to re-order it...I&#x27;m on my second box.  We&#x27;re using it in the shower but I also keep a bar at one of my other household sinks.  It has a pleasing fragrance, seems to lather well enough</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Have used it for years.  Smells great; very moisturizing!  I used to have to drive across town to get it at a health food store; love that I can get it at Amazon!  Great price..and makes nice little occasional/visiting gift (I use 3 bars, wrap in tulle, etc., tied with ribbon).</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of sandalwood,as I do, this is great soap. Good for bathing, good for&lt;br /&gt;perfuming a drawer.</li>
    <li> If you Love sandlewood than you&#x27;ll love this soap bar.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap and excellent smell but it can be a little drying.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice sandalwood fragrance. The wrapping is nice. The bars are slightly on the small size, but they&#x27;re still a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Great product at an affordable price. Came quickly, too!</li>
    <li> I cannot get over the incredible value of these soaps!  I love the sandal wood scent and am always on the lookout for products that are scented with it.  And these most certainly are.  They are very strong smelling although once out of the shower/bath the scent on your skin is very, very soft.  They lather beautifully too!  Although I will use these mostly for myself; I will also give them as gift since they are so beautifully packaged:)  What a great price, soap and purchasing/delivery experience!</li>
    <li> Came in fast,the price was good and like always happy dealing with Amazon.They always seem to have the lowest price and the highest quality.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Leaves no residue and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Most soaps leave my skin itchy or feeling like some of the product hasn&#x27;t rinsed off. I tried this soap while away from home and without my usual brand at the time and have bought this brand of soap exclusively since Sept &#x27;08. It is not sold in stores in my area and I order it online. The company I ordered it from most recently offers prompt delivery and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing and washes you up and rinses away like magic! I cannot recommend it enough! Buy lots and lots!</li>
    <li> Smell fantastic , l put them in the clothes case, and all my clothes smell good</li>
    <li> The smell is great. Unfortunately it made me itch. If you have sensitive skin this may not be for you. Thankfully my husband can make use of it!</li>
    <li> There are better sandalwood soaps. There are better soaps, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It&#x27;s soap. It gets you clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Sandalwood smell, what there is of it, is unusual. Not terrible, but not like real sandalwood at all. That said, the soaps I received had very little scent at all; there was more scent on the overwrap than in the soap. I separated them and allowed them to air out, hoping that would help, but no dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rec: I suggest [[ASIN:B001G7PZB0 Mysore Sandal Soap 2.41 oz Box,  (Pack of 12)]] for a pure sandalwood scent or [[ASIN:B00112DRHY Sandalwood 100% Pure &amp; Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)]] for something just as nice, but a bit different.</li>
    <li> Scent not too strong - just very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great soap with a wonderful aroma; suds up well and smells great; even makes the bathroom smell super.</li>
    <li> Very economical way to purchase Sandalwood soap.  These bars are a nice size (a bit smaller than most regular size bars but not too tiny), have a nice lather that rinses clean, and they do not get mushy like some other sandalwood soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  Really great scent of sandalwood that lasts quite a while, but imo does not last to the very end of the bar.  I think Chandrika sandalwood soap probably smells stronger but the bars do not last very long.  I&#x27;d give this soap 5 stars if the scent was stronger right to the end of the bar.  The wrapping on the soap is kind of exotic looking.  Makes a nice gift, whether giving just 1 or the whole set of 12.</li>
    <li> Got these as gifts. Everyone seemed to like them. I don&#x27;t use them personally. Haven&#x27;t received any negative comments from anyone I gave them too. They did smell good.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what I had anticipated - a bit more floral in scent than I&#x27;d been wanting. The soap does dry my skin out a bit so I&#x27;d not make the purchase again.</li>
    <li> This does not have a sandal wood scent.  I passed them out at work</li>
    <li> Fragrance did not last long enough. Some of the wrappings were worn. Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap!  The scent is heavenly!! Love the way it leaves my skin as well.  Everyone should try it!</li>
    <li> Bought these before  so I know what to expect.  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> smells great and doesnt just fall apart like the crap u buy in the craft stores. Lasts a long time and the fragrance isnt overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap and was very disappointed with the product. It seems to be old merchandise and has no scent and does not lather well! I would not recommend it for purchase at all. Even the packaging seemed old. The box was flimsy and the wrapping were loose on each bar of soap!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent of this soap but it&#x27;s lathering ability is horrible. But, twelve bars for twelve bucks make&#x27;s it worth it, I guess. I think I&#x27;ll end up using these on my boat instead of at home.</li>
    <li> I purchases a few boxes because this is a mild soap with a great smell. I use only this brand because it doesnt dry my skin.Really great soap</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the scent disappears quickly and you are left with a lump of soap with no scent.</li>
    <li> See &amp;#34;Roses&amp;#34; purchase comments above for details!  Always looking for more thoughtful way to express appreciation to those with whom I connect in a day.  These are working nicely for now.</li>
    <li> I bought a huge box of this soap and havent stopped using it, works well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, will probably use somehting else next time, only because I like to try different sopas, this one definitely works well though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, I leave bars of it around for the fragrance, like potpourri. Brings back fond memories of the 70&#x27;s when I first discovered it. I&#x27;m happy to find it again. I like the way my skin smells and feels after I use it. Very Zen.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood soap feels great on my skin. Really clean feeling and nice smell.</li>
    <li> Used to buy this many years ago in Asian stores before I knew any better and likely was poorer.  Perhaps disappeared from the U.S. market for a number of years (maybe the Chinese became affluent enough to buy it themselves) and now that iit&#x27;s back maybe now they&#x27;re so affluent that they want really pure smelling sandalwood which this is not.  Suggest spending a little more for triple milled purer smelling sandalwood soap (which lasts 3x longer than single milled), a good one at a the reasonable price of $4.50 for a 3.6 oz bar at VT Country Store, plus made in VT.</li>
    <li> This js a good product , but could be improved by adding additional scent for a stronger presentation of the sandalwood fragrance .</li>
    <li> My husband was the one who uses this soap. It smelled so good I decided to try it. Wow! Loving it and the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
    <li> I got this soap in a shop in San Francisco in 1991 and have been using this product ever since. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Love it.</li>
    <li> this used to only be available in a health food store or organic grocers..Most of the time they don&#x27;t even have it..i was happy to see it here for a case price of around $10..it came in record time..Like 3 days after I ordered it..the scent is lovely and it&#x27;s hypo allergenic made with all natural ingredients..Not a finer soap can be had than this one..</li>
    <li> Fragrance is mild and not overpowering.  Delicate and smells expensive.  One bar has lasted for almost 30 days.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of these soaps for a baby shower as party favors. I knew the soap was from China, but I didn&#x27;t realize that the soap itself would have Chinese writing on it. I wish this would have been mentioned in the description. It does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is good quality and inexpensive. I am a sandalwood fan, and really like this particular fragrance. It is reminiscent of wood rather than cologne.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  I use this to wash my body and face.  It&#x27;s my go-to sink-side soap.  Say that 3 times fast.  The scent is of sandal wood and very nice.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger like a deodorant bar.</li>
    <li> Very good but strong fragrance.  The soap itself is also strong, so definitely don&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother who thinks this is the best soap in the world. He likes how it doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel tight after showering the way many soaps do. And best of all, he loves the mild scent. He would not know this stuff existed had I not been unhappy with a purchase of it a year or so ago. I gave him some to try as I was about to toss it and he was hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time. Quality of soap is very bad. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t smell like the sandalwood I was looking for, but it was beautifully wrapped...made a good Christmas gift...and the recipients liked it...</li>
