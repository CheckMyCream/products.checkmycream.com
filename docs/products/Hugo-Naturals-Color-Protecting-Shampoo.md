      <li>I love Hugo Products</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several tea tree oil shampoos and this one is the perfect intersection of price, sudsiness (as you may know, sometimes natural products don&#x27;t give you that pleasant &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; experience), itch relief, and a nice smell.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for some lavender scent but the tea tree oil scent is strong and overwhelming, no lavender to be found.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair clean and soooo shiny!</li>
      <li>first my hair did not look clean and felt kind of like barbie hair!</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>This is a very mild shampoo, which I use every day.</li>
      <li>It does dry hair quite a bit, so I have to use a very very good moisturizing conditioner with it.</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>I found this shampoo on the Skin Deep website and I love, love, love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>it was a waste of money but great shampoo tried it before and liked it</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t lather smoothly.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t go back to the unnatural products after using their great shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped of all</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair clean and shiny though.</li>
      <li>At home, I just get clean</li>
      <li>nothing special.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather much at all, but that is a good thing since it has no harsh detergents!</li>
      <li>I now use it once a month or so and use a mild shampoo in between.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, smells good, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>A truly all natural ingredients list that leaves my greasy hair feeling clean, light, and product free.</li>
      <li>Overall though, I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
      <li>Of course, my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it should be on a shampoo commercial.... but trying for a more natural approach to hair care, I am very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I have oily, fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>My fine, limp hair has never looked and felt so good.</li>
      <li>It may be cheaper than Aubrey, but Aubrey is worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit spendy, not crazy though, but I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t truly suds up the way you might be used to with commercial shampoos, but that&#x27;s due to its wonderful ingredients list</li>
      <li>Feels light, not sudsy, great subtle scent.  </li>
      <li>It does not lather as much as the brands I&#x27;m used to, but it leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>I tried everything before this - &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos that really weren&#x27;t, the baking soda/no poo method, none of it worked for me!</li>
      <li>It is the first low-toxic shampoo I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>So I believe it lathered up on the first shampooing.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is exactly as it says, a balancing shampoo.</li>
      <li>I use the red tea ylang ylang which I love.</li>
      <li>I was able to curl my hair and go out to dinner without having to worry about a big oily glob.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pleasing and mild, not overpowering like many other brands.</li>
      <li>At the salon, after the color treatment, my hair is essentially clean (not heavy with oils).</li>
      <li>work fine on my short hair.</li>
      <li>Yet a conditioner alleviated the knots so no real issue.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I prefer.</li>
      <li>I have very itchy scalp that is not dandruff (no flakes).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
      <li>I often skip conditioner because my hair is so oily but with this shampoo you really need the conditioner.</li>
      <li>Relaxing and cleans really well.  </li>
      <li>and if your hair is wet enough you can get a good lather going anyway.</li>
      <li>This is the first natural shampoo I have used</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My hair naturally has body - neither curly nor straight.  </li>
      <li>reviewer said it gets better over time, but using it in our soft water was very unpleasant, so I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plus side is it has a pretty good ingredient list and</li>
      <li>expected it to be good to my hair, its way too harsh</li>
      <li>I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have many of the chemicals found in other shampoos.</li>
      <li>but after that Wow!  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better in hard water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s natural goodness.</li>
      <li>The only real point I make is to avoid dandruff.</li>
      <li>As far as natural shampoos go, you cannot beat this product or it&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>I was embarrassed because I ran into my cousin with frizzy hair in public thanks to this shampoo.</li>
      <li>First of all let me say that I do not have long and illustrious hair.</li>
      <li>Because this is a clean, green product, I need to use so much less to get my hair clean.</li>
      <li>My hair seemed pretty dry.  </li>
      <li>I use less shampoo the first time to get my hair clean enough for the lather in the second shampooing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the EWG rating of 1. It works fine. You do need to wash 2x with shampoo to get a lather going. But really, it&#x27;s not big deal. I use less shampoo the first time to get my hair clean enough for the lather in the second shampooing. Smells lovely. Happy it&#x27;s not an added fragrance. It&#x27;s a temporary fragrance from the essential oils. Had my hair dresser use this following a color treatment. She didn&#x27;t complain about foaming. Hair came out awesome! Salon results from my hair dresser. At home, I just get clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you take into account what kind of ingredients are used to create a great lather. Most of it is not necessary and not healthy. I think the lather-ability depends on how dirty your hair is. At the salon, after the color treatment, my hair is essentially clean (not heavy with oils). So I believe it lathered up on the first shampooing. But my hair dresser followed the directions to the letter anyway.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. Just doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I prefer. Leaves my hair clean and shiny though. I rotate it in once a week to help clarify my hair.</li>
    <li> Because this is a clean, green product, I need to use so much less to get my hair clean. It lathers well, smells good, and lasts a long time. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a build-up in my hair.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo on the Skin Deep website and I love, love, love this shampoo! As others have said, it can be a bit drying, but it is perfect when paired with the Balancing Conditioner. My fine, limp hair has never looked and felt so good. And bonus, this shampoo/conditioner combo has helped strengthen my nails too. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> expected it to be good to my hair, its way too harsh</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!  Feels light, not sudsy, great subtle scent.  Leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped of all it&#x27;s natural goodness.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great seller!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and works well! Doesn&#x27;t lather much at all, but that is a good thing since it has no harsh detergents! I even use it on my kids&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo feels rather &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; to me. Has to be the tea tree oil. It just doesn&#x27;t lather smoothly. I will try something else that does not contain toxins next time. It does last a while tho.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the best &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; shampoo. This one is a healthy, good smelling, effective shampoo. It&#x27;s a bit spendy, not crazy though, but I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> First of all let me say that I do not have long and illustrious hair. I have very short hair that requires and received very little maintenance. The only real point I make is to avoid dandruff. For years I used Head and Shoulders with frankly disappointing results, but figured, what other options are there? I finally decided to give this a try as a natural alternative, being a little uncomfortable with continually using Head and Shoulders over the years, and was astonished at the results.  I use it in tandem with the conditioner of the same make and model, and the one and only time I have let my hair grow out while using this product was a little shocked at how little it contributed to the body and smoothness of my hair, but it does a great job at the hygienic purpose of keeping it flake free.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Leaves my hair clean and soooo shiny! It doesn&#x27;t lather up the same way conventional shampoos do, so it takes a little while to get used to that, but it gets my hair clean, and it&#x27;s never looked healthier!</li>
    <li> I love Hugo Products and I can&#x27;t go back to the unnatural products after using their great shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> great shampoo,but unfortunately i received a damaged bottle too bad it was a waste of money but great shampoo tried it before and liked it</li>
    <li> Great organic shampoo.  It is like aromatherapy in the shower!  Relaxing and cleans really well.  I do still find myself using quite a bit because the foaming agents are missing... Old habits die hard.  But I feel great knowing it&#x27;s healthy for my head and body.</li>
    <li> We have soft water at our house, so I was surprised that this shampoo was so hard to use (it&#x27;s usually hard water that makes natural shampoos harder to use, as the minerals in hard water react with the natural ingredients and make it harder to get the product to foam up). It made my hair a tangled and stripped/squeaky mess (it literally squeaked like a rubber glove against a plastic container) in the shower, so much so, that I found it very difficult to even get my hands through my hair to work the product around. Maybe it&#x27;s better in hard water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were okay. I mean, my hair was clean, but it looked pretty dull and mousy, all the shine in my hair seemed to be dim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer said it gets better over time, but using it in our soft water was very unpleasant, so I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plus side is it has a pretty good ingredient list and the smell is very nice. It is at least nice to know that this shampoo is working well for other people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year and I really like it. It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores, even stores that carry other Hugo products, which is why I started ordering from Amazon. I have very itchy scalp that is not dandruff (no flakes). I&#x27;ve tried several tea tree oil shampoos and this one is the perfect intersection of price, sudsiness (as you may know, sometimes natural products don&#x27;t give you that pleasant &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; experience), itch relief, and a nice smell.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild shampoo, which I use every day. The scent is pleasing and mild, not overpowering like many other brands. I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have many of the chemicals found in other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at a 50% discount and was hopeful that I could alternate this shampoo with another product that I use.  One week after using it I was disappointed in the results.  After using this shampoo my hair seemed heavy and never really felt clean.  Even with the discounted price, I probably won&#x27;t continue using the rest of this product.  I would not recommend purchasing this as I just don&#x27;t think it contributes to healthy, bouncy hair.</li>
    <li> I like knowing that I am using a safe product for myself and the planet, however my hair never feels clean :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to have greasy hair as it is, so maybe I&#x27;m just a bad candidate for this product. It does smell nice. Hopefully I can find something both safe for the planet AND cleansing!</li>
    <li> This shampoo rocks! A truly all natural ingredients list that leaves my greasy hair feeling clean, light, and product free. I tried everything before this - &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos that really weren&#x27;t, the baking soda/no poo method, none of it worked for me! This shampoo is wonderful. It won&#x27;t truly suds up the way you might be used to with commercial shampoos, but that&#x27;s due to its wonderful ingredients list and if your hair is wet enough you can get a good lather going anyway. When I first bought this I was skeptical of the small bottle size, but I can happily use a dime to quarter size amount for a head of thin, shoulder length hair. It should last me anywhere from 2 - 3 months! Way longer than anything I&#x27;ve bought at the store.</li>
    <li> Hair feels and looks great. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as your typical shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many complements on my hair since using this product. I usually have issues with oily hair and then dry hair when I try to get the oil out. This shampoo is exactly as it says, a balancing shampoo. My only advice is to buy and use the conditioner as well. I often skip conditioner because my hair is so oily but with this shampoo you really need the conditioner. It got too dry without it. Overall though, I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have oily scalp with dry hair. It did dry out the scalp a bit, but I figured using a ACV rinse afterwards works ok. It does dry hair quite a bit, so I have to use a very very good moisturizing conditioner with it. I use the red tea ylang ylang which I love. Its also a bit difficult to apply -its runny and causes some sort of dryness, for the 2nd application, I find it difficult to reach the roots. I now use it once a month or so and use a mild shampoo in between. An upside is that it is natural and ewg.org gives it a very low hazard rating. Also helps a bit with flakes and itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> not really spectacular as a shampoo...nothing special. the smell is not very strong but i don&#x27;t smell anything at all!</li>
    <li> Left my curly hair clean, but a knotty and tangled mess. Yet a conditioner alleviated the knots so no real issue.</li>
    <li> It may be cheaper than Aubrey, but Aubrey is worth the money. This shampoo dries your hair into  a piece of straw. You will walk around with frizzed out hair. I was embarrassed because I ran into my cousin with frizzy hair in public thanks to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> i have not used it yet. the shampoo is wonderful. some of the hugo conditioners are a bit greasy, esp for my daughter with her long lustrous locks. work fine on my short hair.</li>
    <li> Dull and does not clean hair well.</li>
    <li> This is the first natural shampoo I have used and I love it!  It smells great and leaves my hair so smooth and soft.  It does not lather as much as the brands I&#x27;m used to, but it leaves my hair feeling clean.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It did take my hair a while to adapt to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first my hair did not look clean and felt kind of like barbie hair! I did stick with it though, and within about 3 weeks, I was enjoying this product.</li>
    <li> As far as natural shampoos go, you cannot beat this product or it&#x27;s price. I have tried very expensive natural shampoo and it leaves my hair greasy and feeling unclean. This soap actually lathers if you wash twice with it (which I only do if I have build up) and it smells heavenly! If you are looking to rid yourself of the chemicals in your current shampoo, go for Hugo!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s healthy, without a lot of fragrance and toxins, and it cleans without stripping my hair.</li>
    <li> I must preface this by saying that I have long, dark hair that I do NOT color or use product on (besides hair spray on special occasions) or blow dry.  My hair naturally has body - neither curly nor straight.  The first week or so that I used this product (along with the conditioner), I admit that I was a little disappointed.  My hair seemed pretty dry.  However, as I continued to use it (not straying at all to a &amp;#34;regular shampoo/cond)... I have been LOVING my hair!  I have gotten so many compliments this summer on how shiny and healthy it looks.  And it honestly does!  I think there may be a couple weeks where your hair may go through a dry phase as it tries to balance out the natural oils from your scalp... but after that Wow!  I highly recommend this product!  Of course, my hair doesn&#x27;t look like it should be on a shampoo commercial.... but trying for a more natural approach to hair care, I am very satisfied.  I also have to say that I have had no problems with dandruff/dry scalp (though I never really did much before).</li>
    <li> I was actually quite impressed with this product. It is the first low-toxic shampoo I&#x27;ve used so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I have oily, fine, straight hair so I shower every morning, don&#x27;t use any products in it and by the end of the day, my roots are oily.  Below is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;1. When washing my hair, it felt almost as though I stripped everything off (I guess I was just used to stuff left on my hair from store brand products). However, once I blew it dry it was shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;2. By the end of the day, my roots were not oily. I was able to curl my hair and go out to dinner without having to worry about a big oily glob.  But, as expected, my roots were oily the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, the smell is overwhelming!  It is tea tree oil and lavender. I was hoping for some lavender scent but the tea tree oil scent is strong and overwhelming, no lavender to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept this product because my hair responded so well to it and it is good for my body. However, after the shampoo and conditioner are used up, I will be trying the Coconut scented Hugo Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
