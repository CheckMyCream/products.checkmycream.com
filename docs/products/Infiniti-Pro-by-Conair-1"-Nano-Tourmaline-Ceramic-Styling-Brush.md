      <li>I have to keep it on the lowest setting which doesn&#x27;t really curl my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it works really well on women of color who have thick coarse hair,it straightens, curls gives your hair a nice shine.</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>First the short teeth on this brush burned my scalp, then the bangs area of my scalp, then my bangs got shorter and shorter before I realized I was FRYING my hair</li>
      <li>BY far beats any of the products I have purchased...</li>
      <li>I believe either a man invented it, or a person who NEVER tried it even once!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is professional, I just don&#x27;t want to be reminded of TERROR by the red tape for a $24 item return.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shorter inner bristles (red) actually heat up and they are as hot as the flat surface of the brush!  </li>
      <li>Other Conair Irons that I have bought at Walmart &amp; Target have cords that are 9.5 ft long, making it so much easier to move around.  </li>

<li> Other Conair Irons that I have bought at Walmart &amp; Target have cords that are 9.5 ft long, making it so much easier to move around.  </li>

<li> I bought this as an alternate  to the very expensive popular model advertised on TV.  </li>
<li> The red combs get hot and make it very hard to wrap my hair around the iron with my hand.  </li>
<li> I bought the 1-1/4 inch size, and after attempting to use it for a week or more, returned it because it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep from burning either your scalp or fingers using this appliance.  </li>
<li> It has red bristles that heat up and black that don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> Although, it&#x27;s still rather hard to keep your fingers from coming in contact with inner bristles because they stick out.  </li>
<li> hard to curl ends on long hair</li>
<li> I feel tethered to the outlet with little room to work.  </li>
<li> For a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; iron the cord is a ridiculous 5 ft long.  </li>
<li> I use this everyday &amp; my hair looks terrific…</li>
<li> Short bristles not best for thick long hair</li>
<li> Smooths the hair with a little curl at the end!</li>

    <li> I love this curling brush. It takes the frizz factor out of my hair. It also heats quickly and my hair is curled in minutes.</li>
    <li> Finally one with heat... love the handle the cord does not tangle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I use this everyday &amp; my hair looks terrific…</li>
    <li> Have used this styling brush for years. I really like the improvement made to the power button, it is now indented so you can&#x27;t accidently shut it off while styling your hair.</li>
    <li> The spokes around the wand are too short in places causing the iron to burn my scalp (and fingers). I have to keep it on the lowest setting which doesn&#x27;t really curl my hair.</li>
    <li> A great product.  It heats up fast with more heat control.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Short bristles not best for thick long hair</li>
    <li> Just used it yesterday.  Start out on the lowest temp, and move upward in heat setting until you get&lt;br /&gt;the amount of heat your looking for.  For me, one up from the lowest worked great.  Just the right&lt;br /&gt;amount of heat to get the frizz out of my hair after washing.  Also puts just the right amount of wave&lt;br /&gt;to look styled and ready to go in five minutes.</li>
    <li> I have waste long hair, The conair  infinity pro goes through my hair ...absolutely incredible. I have tried multiple different products they always get tangled this is DOSE NOT TANGLE.. My daughter has shorter hair it gives that lift &amp; gorgeous shiny CURLES..glides through hair. it also adds a wonderful shine it is incredible.... BY far beats any of the products I have purchased...&lt;br /&gt;Incredible CURLES, LIFT, a bonus the SHINE</li>
    <li> hard to curl ends on long hair</li>
    <li> Its finally work for me when I have lightly perm and very happy.....Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent, works perfectly</li>
    <li> This curling brush gives Big, Smooth, Soft Curls... it&#x27;s the only thing I will use 💕</li>
    <li> Love it! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This curling brush is very nice. It has red bristles that heat up and black that don&#x27;t.  The teeth dont break off like the Instyler brush sold on TV.</li>
    <li> I love my new hot brush! It&#x27;s larger diameter helps do a smoother hairstyle.  It even heats up quickly. I just ordered a second one for travel!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but at a local discount store. I bought the 1-1/4 inch size, and after attempting to use it for a week or more, returned it because it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep from burning either your scalp or fingers using this appliance.  The shorter inner bristles (red) actually heat up and they are as hot as the flat surface of the brush!  I have decades of experience with styling brushes and curling irons, so I&#x27;m not a novice at using these appliances.  My hair is medium length, so possibly if someone with long hair was using just on the ends, maybe a different experience.  Although, it&#x27;s still rather hard to keep your fingers from coming in contact with inner bristles because they stick out.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars is that other than this major flaw, the brush has some great features and is reasonably priced.  I&#x27;ve purchased a number of Conair products over the years, and never had to return one until now. The 3/4&amp;#34; curling brush I bought ten years ago is still going strong ... and doesn&#x27;t burn me when I use it!</li>
    <li> Smooths the hair with a little curl at the end!</li>
    <li> Good for longer hair.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate feeling for this curling iron.  The red combs get hot and make it very hard to wrap my hair around the iron with my hand.  I get burned every time. For a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; iron the cord is a ridiculous 5 ft long.  I feel tethered to the outlet with little room to work.  Other Conair Irons that I have bought at Walmart &amp; Target have cords that are 9.5 ft long, making it so much easier to move around.  It otherwise is a good quality iron.  It gets very hot and it makes my hair very soft with smooth curls. A longer cord and eliminating the red combs will make it the perfect iron!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it works really well on women of color who have thick coarse hair,it straightens, curls gives your hair a nice shine.I wish it came 3/4inch and 1/2inch.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I bought one for my daughter too. It lifts and curls your hair.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternate  to the very expensive popular model advertised on TV.  Although I cannot really compare the teo, that item did not seem to have great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This styler works great, seems solid. I have a regular  curling  iron by the same company  that has held up well, so I am confident  that this one will be sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This Conair hot brush is so hot it burned about an inch off my bangs - my thinnest hair.  First the short teeth on this brush burned my scalp, then the bangs area of my scalp, then my bangs got shorter and shorter before I realized I was FRYING my hair off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to using my Conair 1.5&amp;#34; hot brush once my scalp heals!&lt;br /&gt;The shorter bristles shouldn&#x27;t be touching my scalp.  I believe either a man invented it, or a person who NEVER tried it even once!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is professional, I just don&#x27;t want to be reminded of TERROR by the red tape for a $24 item return.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
