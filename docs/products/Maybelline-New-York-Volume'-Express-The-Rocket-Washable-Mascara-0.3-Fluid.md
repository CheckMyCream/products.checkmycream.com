<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this mascara simply because it goes on so evenly without needing many coats. To get the mascara off I just use Johnson and Johnson baby wash and it takes everything off with no hassle. It does take some time to dry but it doesn&#x27;t bother me personally. Once it starts getting old it&#x27;ll begin to clump up but that&#x27;s in the span of 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I have always been excited to try new mascaras, and after seeing many ads for \\&quot;The Rocket\\&quot; I was ecstatic to try it out. First off, the application is not smooth: Eyelashes are clumped together with every application which really makes for an unattractive look. Second of all, getting this mascara off is close to IMPOSSIBLE. I have had some mascaras that were extremely hard to wash off, but this really takes the cake for being the most difficult. Baby oil barely even worked!!! I will NOT buy this mascara ever again and definitely do not recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I have used countless eye products from Maybelline and usually like most of them.  But I have to say this is the worst product I have purchased from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It simply will NOT stay on lashes.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with clumps as others have noted.  But this mascara starts to smudge as soon as applied.  I work in the public and do not like having the \\&quot;raccoon look\\&quot;, but every time I check a mirror, it is smudged below my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned, so I bought the brown and I do love the color. It is perfect.  And I also love the brush applicator. It goes on smooth and uniform...now if it just wouldn&#x27;t rub off and smear around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the applicator &amp; color; hate the mascara itself.  Would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t make my eyes water &amp; I lucked out when I purchased this!!  Just wipe off the excess on the inside top of the container &amp; your lashes won&#x27;t clump.  Makes my eyes pop and my eyelashes look gorgeous.  I even think the container is cute too!!!  I recommend this over any other mascara!!!</li>
    <li> very nice mascara and much cheaper on amazon than in CVS, makes eyelashes look fuller and longer. would buy again!</li>
    <li> I dont under stand all of the negative reviews. It is not clumpy and makes my eyes look amazing! I have gotten so many compliments on hkw long my eyelashes look! I definately reccomend it!</li>
    <li> This is now my go to mascara,</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE product. I have used other Maybelline mascaras, but this is the worst and I will not use it again. Firstly, the mascara runs. During the day I ended up with streaks of black around my eyebrows from the tips of my eyelashes brushing up against my eyelid during the day. This almost never, ever happens to me. Secondly, it says it is washable but I had to seriously scrub my eyes very hard with soap and water to get it off. Other smudgeproof mascaras at the drugstore are far superior. STAY AWAY</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my eyelashes look good but it is almost IMPOSSSIBLE to get off! The formula completely sticks to your eyelashes and even the waterproof is hard to get off. I have to scrub this off in the shower. I heard this was a good alternative to One by One and it is not. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mascara for over a month and it gives me amazing lashes!!!! I think everyone needs to try this mascara!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  It makes my lashes longer and A BIT fuller, but not super thick.  The brush is plastic and the wand comes out with a lot less product on it, so it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I like the short bristles on the brush because I like to get SUPER close to my eyes, at the very base of my lashes and this allows me to do this.  Also, blackest black is TRUE, it is very deep black.  My only problem is this stuff is almost impossible to get off.  There&#x27;s always left over mascara on my lashes, it takes forever to get off.  And I only buy washable mascara because I hate waking up with old mascara surprises.  Besides that I love everything about it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years. Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll try a different mascara that someone tells me about, but I always find myself coming back to this one because nothing else compares. It makes my lashes look long, dark, and thick. The best part is how great it is at separating my lashes. My lashes never look clumpy with this mascara. I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody!</li>
    <li> I have used TONS of mascaras. I&#x27;m only 17 but mascara has to be my weakness; at one point I had 12 different mascaras and would use at least 3 to get my desired look. I&#x27;m constantly testing mascaras to see which clump, which dry too fast or too slow, which flake and which look just plain fabulous. And this one is one of the fabulous ones. I&#x27;ve never been let down by Maybelline mascaras to date, I am the biggest Maybelline advocate there is so maybe I&#x27;m a tad biased. I tried this one out just to see, and it works SOOO well. It gives lots of volume and length without being overly clumpy and I usually apply mascara pretty fast so in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly. Doesn&#x27;t flake much at all, and I have never had a problem with it! I like my lashes voluminous and long and for me this is perfect. If you prefer them more subtle, try Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Blast or Lash Blast Volume.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this particular line by Maybelline.  I love it!  Nice thick lashes quickly without having to do several coats.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara and the only one I&#x27;ll wear. Makes lashes look so long and defined. No clumping whatsoever!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite drug store mascara. It wears well, no clumping and does make my lashes look fuller and longer. Does exactly what it says!! I have gone through 4 of these...Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Tried this out and the bristles are very short on the brush, they felt like little needles along my lash line, have never had that problem before with other mascara brushes... also it was supposed to be washable but soap and water didn&#x27;t get it off, had to scrub it off with make up remover so I&#x27;d consider this more of a waterproof mascara. I&#x27;m partial to washable mascara since the waterproof is really tough on my lashes and usually rips them out easily. ouch! That&#x27;s why for me the 2 star rating, I&#x27;ll be sticking with Maybelline&#x27;s The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express Cat Eyes mascara since it has a curved brush and layers without clumping.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I have purchased Lancôme and other high end but this makes my thin lashes look lush without clumping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third one, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried most of them, online, dept store and drug store...this mascara is beautifully rich saturated black (the blackest black shade). It extends as well as thickens my lashes. It only starts to clump if it&#x27;s been open and used for a month or two due to too much daily exposure to air, or if the container is too cold. This mascara is very flattering when you have lashes that are either too thin, too short or too blonde (all three are my problems, grrr!). The trick that I do is to curl the upper lashes on one eye, apply the mascara there then on my lower lashes on that side, then do the same on the other eye...if I want my lashes to look longer and thicker I repeat. Just keep in mind that to reduce clumps make sure your tube isn&#x27;t too cold or too old (over a month of daily usage). My skin tends to be dry so I can&#x27;t address how the Rocket mascara affects oily skin, just to say that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; under my eyes given that my skin is dry.  Hope this helps whoever might read this.</li>
    <li> I am a fairly experienced mascara user, and this one isn&#x27;t quite up to snuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-cute packaging&lt;br /&gt;-lasts a very long time without being waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-good brush&lt;br /&gt;-so-so volume... not THAT \\&quot;explosive.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-hard to get off&lt;br /&gt;-leaves residue&lt;br /&gt;-HOLY CRAP THE CLUMPS&lt;br /&gt;-THE CLUMPS MAN&lt;br /&gt;-THERE ARE SO MANY</li>
    <li> I bought this because Melissa Autry recommended it on you tube. It has the silicone wand, and it doesn&#x27;t clump on me. The volume is decent, but I use this as a base coat on my lashes, then any other brand as a second coat (I wait about three minutes between coats), then I do a third and final coat of this to seal my lashes.  My coworkers think I have false lashes on. It never flakes on me, even after working out. It has no noticeable odor like the colossal, which makes my eyes water. The consistency is thin in my opinion. It&#x27;s very good with layering.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it helps my eyelashes  look longer</li>
    <li> I love this mascara - I use it along with the non waterproof - first I curl then immediately put a layer of this on, let it dry and that sets the curl - then go over my lashes 2 more times with the regular (non waterproof) and it gives me a great length, thickness and stays curled all day!</li>
    <li> very drying and clumpy! don&#x27;t like this mascara at all</li>
    <li> I love expensive mascara but don&#x27;t want to pay for it. I had tried several of the other maybelline similar mascaras (The tubes all look the same but are different vibrant colors) and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with them so I wasn&#x27;t going to try this one. But I read in a magazine article of the best and worst mascaras that this one was one of the best and extremely good for the price so I tried it and I am not disappointed. For me the important thing is the brush actually. This has a brush just like that in the Benefit &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara, which is my all time favorite. So now I have it and like 1/4 the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used many many different brands.  It goes on easy and stays on all day and surprisingly it comes off easy with an eye make remover.  It coats my eye lashes with only a few strokes and give me a full look that I love.</li>
    <li> I was on a quest for the best mascara out there.  I was actually considering buying the false fiber mascara but it looks too clumpy and fibery.  I read many, many reviews on different websites and watched review videos on youtube and decided to try this out.  It&#x27;s been the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.  No clumping, even distribution, great brush - what more can you ask for?!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I gave this product two stars simply because it looks good once it&#x27;s on. I had heard before I bought it that it was hard to get off so I bought the non-waterproof kind in hopes it would come off easier. No ma&#x27;am. Whenever I wear it, it takes about 20 years to get off and you literally have to scrub your eyes raw only to find that instead of wiping off onto your washcloth it has smudged onto the skin below your eyes. It&#x27;s horrible and so not worth the money. The way it looks once it&#x27;s on is no better than any other name brand mascara you could buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that I&#x27;ve ranted about mascara, just don&#x27;t buy it. It sucks.</li>
    <li> Really really good! It giver the eyelashes a perfect look! very wide open eyes and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this is January and didn&#x27;t like it very much. Yes it did give my lashes length and volume, but it clumped and flaked like crazy on me. I gave it a try again cause I saw it sitting in my mascara bin, and it&#x27;s like a totally different mascara! It gave my lashes length and volume, but didn&#x27;t flake or clump on me. It&#x27;s a gel-like formula and the pigment of the black is pretty intense. The staying power is great as well! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, like any other mascara. There wasn&#x27;t anything that wow&#x27;ed me about this brand, I just remember it was fine the first time I bought it and why not a second time. It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me because it clumps. I don&#x27;t pack on mascara. It seems like in its attempt to get volume, it makes your lashes pretty spidery. I use a conditioner on top of this to soften it a bit, but overall, this product just does what most mascaras do.</li>
    <li> After 2 coats, thick formula provides great coverage, length and thickness, but it starts flaking off 3hrs after applying. Reasonable price, but may not be worth it if you must re-apply every few hrs. while enduring slight sting when flakes fall on eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara seems like it could have good potential: it&#x27;s highly pigmented, it goes on really well (probably TOO much product, though), and lengthens my lashes. However, it makes my lashes to stick together in clusters, even if I comb through them really well after applying. I&#x27;ve also tried to dry out the mascara a little bit, so it doesn&#x27;t put soo much product on, but I still get that unattractive, spider eye look that looks like I applied way too many coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning this and going back to my tried and true Clump Crusher.</li>
    <li> This mascara is just am amazing. I honestly love maybelline products! I have had cover girl loreal and even tarte mascara. This works amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara so much! what i do to prevent clumps is to start with a plain mascara with no volume and put my rocket volume mascara over that and its perfect! i love this mascara too bad i have to put one underneath it to not have it clumpy. and the next bad thing is it leaves around A LOT of residue! its easy to come off for me and adds A LOT of volume! i would recommend this to anybody that wants high volume lashes!</li>
    <li> yes it makes my lashes longer looking and thick and its also easy to remove but i hate the fact that it smudges just like any other mascara it was a waste of money and i wont buy it ever again because my other mascara already does what this one does!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nothing fabulous. its available in drug stores now. I bought it since i heard so many rave reviews but its dries really brittle on lashes and doesn&#x27;t really add a whole lot of volume. .</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras next to Better than Sex Mascara by Too Faced.</li>
    <li> Love it.! Lengthens lashes without clumping and lasts all day.! c:</li>
    <li> This mascara does it&#x27;s job, it makes my lashes look fuller, however it&#x27;s not the best formula on the market (it feels almost oil based). It takes such a long time to dry - at least an hour before I can re-curl my lashes without having them stick to the metal of my curler. It&#x27;s thick, so it weighs down my eyelashes quite a bit. On the plus side, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with flaking and once it does dry and I can recurl my lashes, they look very thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this mascara again. I would keep the brush though. The brush is what keeps my eyelashes from clumping together and distributes the mascara evenly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara!  I switched over from using a L&#x27;Oreal product which I had sworn by for years and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year now and it still impresses me every time.</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than expected.  Does not clump up as quickly as others I&#x27;ve used.  Priced right too.</li>
    <li> something is really wrong with how the brush is built or the liquid is too thick. As soon as you put the brush inside and shake em,. the liquid coats it,.you are literally applying the whole liquid unto your lashes, its so thick that it totally covers the bristles.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this mascara!! The formula of this is amazing ^____^ I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, totally recommend it! No to clumps, Yes to volume .</li>
    <li> I like Maybelline, but didn&#x27;t really fancy this mascara. I guess you can say it was alright, but it wasn&#x27;t anything amazing. I would recommend the Jordana Best Lash Extreme Volumizing Mascara.</li>
    <li> There are lots of mascaras to choose from these days.  This one is exceptional.  Glides on easily, dries quickly and make your eyes pop.  It really lengthens the lash. And the price is right.  No need to spend high dollar on designer mascara.  This one works great.</li>
    <li> I noticed that this mascara caused my eye lashes to clump up and at times I would find my eyelashes falling out after attempting to remove the mascara. (With makeup remover and gentle wiping). I threw it out after a few times and switched over to Origins mascara with less unknown chemicals and whatnot</li>
    <li> Adds length and volume to my lashes and lasts me all day without smudging. The style of the brush prevents clumping and gives a great look. Is an excellent mascara!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. Comparable to &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara. Does not smudge or irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Since purchasing for my daughter for Christmas, this has become our favorite mascara. I bought another for myself. Love it and won&#x27;t buy anything else now.</li>
    <li> This product is not good, it makes a lot of clumps!so if you don&#x27;t like clumps I would not recommend this</li>
    <li> Good product and price</li>
    <li> Best Mascara I have used and I have tried many.</li>
    <li> favorite mascara period</li>
    <li> Love this!  Actually made my lashes look longer and NO clumps!&lt;br /&gt;Donna</li>
    <li> It is soooooo amazing, makes my lashes look like falsies without the hassle of having to wear falsies.. must have mascara no doubt about it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  Really ads thickness and length to my barely there lashes.</li>
    <li> It does not clump or have a chemical smell like some of the other ones do. I like to switch my mascaras everyday, this is one of my most reached ones.</li>
    <li> excellent product and 100% reliable</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m going to have to play w this mascara. I was expecting alot more because of Utube makeup advice. I&#x27;m a drugstore makeup user, and theres basically 3 that everyone gravitate to...one is a yellow tube, one is a black tube, and this is the other one. Hmm, no brands mentioned, but I gotta be honest and say this didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll stick to the other two, and w a third tube that&#x27;s green for lash separation! I couldn&#x27;t get my lashes to look nice w this brand. They sorta just laid their wo length or much fullness. I think it&#x27;s great to try different mascaras to see what works for you and drugstore items are approachable in costs. :)</li>
    <li> This mascara is pretty good. It is very wet at first. I find it works better after you have had it for a bit and the formula dries out a bit. The brush is okay, the rubber tips kind of irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> I generally prefer mascara wands with full brush heads - think Too Faced Better than Sex (my current favorite mascara) or Urban Decay Perversion.  But I like this mascara despite the rubber bristles on the wand.  I find that the color is a nice black and the formula is not too think, not too thick.  It adds thickness and length and I do not have issues with it flaking.  Only downside is that it can clump a bit and because the bristles aren&#x27;t long, I can&#x27;t really comb through the lashes like I do with my favorite mascaras.  However, for the price, it is a good mascara and I often use it when I don&#x27;t feel like spending $22 for a new tube of mascara or when my favorite is sold old.</li>
    <li> The best drugstore mascara I have ever tried, and I have used a lot! Doesn&#x27;t clump and gives the look of longer, fuller lashes.</li>
    <li> i though it was gonna be better. I don&#x27;t like the thing you put on the mascara</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite mascara ever</li>
    <li> Did nothing to lengthen my lashes. And dried SOOO fast it made them clumpy and stuck together. Unless you put your mascara on lightning fast, I cannot recommend this product at all. Too bad, since the original pink/green Maybelline black mascara is still one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> one of the better mascaras i have tried! and i have tried mascara from all drug store brands. i like this one because it has very good pigment (super dark!!) and it can separate my lashes better than anything else. this is a very buildable mascara so you can add on until you think it is good. but in all honesty, you don&#x27;t need much to get a full look. very black, very cheap, and one of the better ones from maybelline :)</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this mascara to me, ranting and raving about how amazing it was. And it did not disappoint. My lashes look long and thick when I use this product; this is much better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used in the past. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Good mascara that makes lashes appear full and somewhat longer as well. Overall a good product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara i&#x27;ve ever used. It makes your lashes longer, thicker and darker. very easy to use and your lashes will look very neat. totally recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used!! I have owned MANY mascaras that were pricey (as much as $50) so I was looking for something cheaper. The first time I tried it I was so excited to see how it would look. It was a clumpy awful mess! I tried everything I could to get it to work, but it was a smeary and had big clumps. I had to take it all off and try again, but it didn&#x27;t work that time either. It was like rubbing black grease across my lashes. Not sure if any of that helps, but I definitely not worth getting!!</li>
    <li> This product is just awful! The mascara is WAY too wet...it seems extremely oily and does nothing for volume or length.</li>
    <li> Goes on clumpy and has a strange consistency. When it dries, it is VERY hard. Impossible to reapply and not have tarantula legs as eyelashes.....</li>
    <li> The product flakes off and the flakes are very difficult to wipe off. What a mess!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It gives me amazing length, volume, and all day curl. I do sometimes get a bit of flaking by the end of the day, but honesty, I don&#x27;t care since my lashes look fantastic. They literally look exactly the same after 12 hours of wear! All my sisters and my mom all swear by this mascara now too.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on very nice.</li>
    <li> So the mascara may actually be volumizing and fantastic, but you would never know because the wand applicator is the equivalent of a million pimples on a stick that could never possibly lift or separate your lashes. This is seriously the dumbest applicator ever invented. You will have short, stubbly, crumbly lashes. Such a shame because MegaPlush is a great product. I&#x27;m a sucker for branding and packaging. Obvi.</li>
    <li> A must buy if you want to lose half your lashes within a month of wearing this! Also, if you want your mascara to crumble onto your cheeks by midday, this is the mascara for you!</li>
    <li> This mascara makes my lashes look alot bigger, but when i try to remove this mascara, it&#x27;s near impossible!! My eyelashes fall out because this mascara really dries my eyelashes up. Try something better.</li>
    <li> When you apply this mascara your lashes look full, lush, curled &amp; great! Within 10 minutes you&#x27;ll have smudges, within an hour your lashes don&#x27;t look like they did when you first applied it &amp; you will have raccoon eyes, this is one of the worse smudging mascaras that I&#x27;ve ever used! I buy high end &amp; low end mascaras, this one is a complete waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Normally I use Maybelline Colossal Volume Express, but decided to give this a try. I really like this mascara- it plumps up my eyelashes and makes them longer too. The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily as the Colossal Volume Express, but does come off easily with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a fantastic mascara.  It is super black and lengthening.  Only problem is that it is very difficult to remove completely, even with a great eye make-up remover.  I didn&#x27;t even buy the waterproof.</li>
    <li> It very helped my eyelashes really pop</li>
    <li> Had a lot of expectations from this mascara. It does give great length and volume. If you have great lashes to begin with then it really is the best mascara that one can have. Give it a try as it can really enhance the lashes and almost make it look like you have fake lashes on. However, if you have scarce, short Asian lashes like me then this mascara isn&#x27;t the best.  Brush size is a little to big for my eyes and is difficult to reach corners without some smudging.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to like this mascara more because I had watched some youtube videos where it applied very dark and I typically enjoy Maybelline mascaras. Since I already have dark eyelashes, I need an extremely dark formula in order for mascara to show up. This was very pigmented, but I found it got very clumpy very quickly. I usually only apply 2 coats during the day (3 at night), but it still clumped my lashes. Since I have &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; lashes (length, thickness, amount, etc.), this was not flattering at all. I will finish the tube and move on...</li>
    <li> Picked this up because it was slightly cheaper than my regular mascara. Some of the most incredible clumping, nearly impossible to remove.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the tube I bought, but this mascara was very flaky.  By the end of the day, lots of flakes under my eyes.  I agree with other reviewers that it was also clumpy.  Back to Cover Girl for me.</li>
    <li> My new favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of mascara brands, both drugstore quality and sephora brands. This honestly does the best job for me. If you are looking for volume and fullness, this mascara delivers without clumping. The unique brush limits how much mascara gets on the wand, so you have to apply it in a few coats for the desired effect. This method seems to work the best for me since wands that hold too much mascara will clump up on my lashes. I always curl my lashes before applying this and I love the effect. I have been using this for about 2 years now and still am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this for about a week.  It lives up to claims - lengthens and separates well.  Doesn&#x27;t add a ton of bulk - it&#x27;s okay for use during the day - but you do clearly have enhanced lashes when wearing it. Wears well so far - minimal flaking.  I plan to give this one a good shot.  It&#x27;s been perfect so far.</li>
    <li> Came in great conditions.</li>
    <li> is an excellent opportunity price and product quality. rated 5 stars for that</li>
    <li> This product was to my girlfriend and she loved it. It is genuine and is presented as it was described by the seller.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  Price in stores 5.99 &amp; up. Buying it on here was much better!!! 2 for the price of 1!! Makes lashes look full!</li>
    <li> GOOD GOING ON...HARD TO GET OFF.</li>
    <li> Clumpy and thick on the first use.  I hate this mascara, I usually use expensive department store/Sephora mascara but thought I would try to save money.  It is super thick and clumpy and does not make my lashes look long at all.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it really does seem to make my eyelashes look longer.  I usually use Clinique, but I haven&#x27;t had time to pick some more up, so I got this one instead.  It starts to clump if you put on too many coats, or try to reapply some more during the day.  But if you put it on your bare lashes, it works really, really well.  My lashes look much longer, and it seems to stay on pretty well, so a second coat a few hours later isn&#x27;t really that necessary.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mascara before from a brick and mortar store and LOVED it. This time it has been a disappointment. I don&#x27;t know why but it refuses to curl. I can curl my eyelashes, apply the mascara and it looks curly. Once it dries however, it pulls the lashes straight. I&#x27;ve never had a mascara do this - maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
    <li> This mascara is great! I will never use another one!!</li>
    <li> I get asked 3 times a day of my eyelashes are real. They are. I just use this mascara. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> this product is very good</li>
    <li> I am a total Mascara Junkie I own/have owned almost every mascara, and this is currently my Third favorite mascara. First of all the packaging is beyond cute. I love the big basic shape of the brush great for volumizing  your lashes. I like to apply this with a lengthening mascara on top to get the perfect look. I love this mascara . My advice is to wipe the brush on the opening to remove any excess mascara so it&#x27;s less likely going to clump.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying new mascaras because CoverGirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Clump Crusher (the one in the hot green tube) is my HG mascara, but i&#x27;m a sucker for marketing and new formulas. This was supposed to be like CoverGirl&#x27;s original Lash Blast with it&#x27;s big brush and rubber bristles and since I liked Lash Blast and I do like some of Maybelline&#x27;s mascaras, I figured i&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Gives good color payoff; very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;* Does give quite a bit of length and volume even to fine blonde lashes like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Smudges on eyelids and underneath eyes if your skin is on the oily side and/or if it&#x27;s humid outside (granted, it&#x27;s the washable formula but I never use waterproof formulas and don&#x27;t have this problem with most other washable formulas).&lt;br /&gt;* Watery-ish type formula, so it takes longer to dry than drier formulas.&lt;br /&gt;* Clumps lashes together, making it necessary for me to use an old clean wand to seperate and fully lengthen my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know alot of people love this mascara and maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type and lashes that cause the problems i&#x27;ve been encountering, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again. The smudging on my eyelids where my lashes touch underneath my brows is a deal breaker for me. I do like the fact it&#x27;s so dark and it does give nice lashes after I mess with it, but I prefer a mascara I don&#x27;t have to take extra time \\&quot;fixing\\&quot; when I can get the same results without hassle from something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
