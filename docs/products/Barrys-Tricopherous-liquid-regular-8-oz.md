    <li> I USED TRICOPHEROUS ALL MY LIFE. FROM CUBA. IT WAS THE BEST FOR THE LACK OF HAIR.5 STARS.</li>
    <li> I bought this bec my hair is thinning (thanks DNA) and my grandparents swore by it. Got the bottle, opened the cap and took a whiff; smells like pure rubbing alcohol. I rubbed the purple potion on my scalp (doesn&#x27;t discolor anything) and felt soothing. Haven&#x27;t noticed hair growth or thickening, but will keep you posted - I&#x27;m sure you can&#x27;t stand the excitement.</li>
    <li> This is great for hair. This product is highly recommended. And do not get easy in Venezuela. I like the way it keeps your hair looking nice and soft and the lavender fragance smells good.</li>

    <li> I just have to say, Barry&#x27;s Tricopherous is great for your hair. I like the way it keeps your hair looking nice and soft and the lavender fragance smells good. It also makes your hair grow because it contains castor oil other ingredients. Overall this product is great, i&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> TOO BAD  U CNT  FIND  THIS  PRODUCT  OUT  IN THE  STREET  ,,,HAVE  BEEN  FOR  100 YEARS  OUT THERE  BUT  HERE  IN THE  USA,,,,,..IF  U  HAIR  IS  FALLING  OR  STOP  SHINNNING  BUY IT  USE  IT  AND  B  HAPPY  CAMPER</li>
    <li> My mom has been telling me about this since my hair started falling - 20&#x27;s (stress, genetics etc.) Finally all these years later she bought bottles off of Amazon and gave me one.  I used it  these past 2 days -took a shower to wash my hair - not a strand or clump fell out.  Usually I go to rinse and nothing but hair is breaking off.  I mean there was not one strand!! I did a double take-washed and rinsed again - nada.  I put a comb through my hair nada. It was soft and manageable (I have curly thinning hair).  It also soothed my scalp-which tends to be sensitive.  I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s not the fanciest of products because it works! Old school is the best.  :)</li>
    <li> this one was for my sister in law, she&#x27;s only four y/o and she have a really thin hair, yes you read it right, this also work to have a stronger hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I was very happy when I found it online. The price is fair.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!!!!!!! My hair stop falling</li>
    <li> I liked it but wasn&#x27;t happy with the alcohol content but it smells geat and isn&#x27;t too oily so I can use it during the day</li>
    <li> This could dry the scalp at first. If you scratch your scalp after you put this liquid on, you will get a purple residue under your nails.</li>
    <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
