<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great and the size of the incense stick was good. So I would make this purchase again and suggest it to others as well</li>
    <li> Pros: my room smells like a church&lt;br /&gt;Cons: my room smells like a church&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole I consider it a win</li>
    <li> Good for clearing negativity.</li>
    <li> I love the scent it&#x27;s so refreshing and it last a long while.</li>
    <li> First off I have to say I actually do not burn much incense. I stick them in all my houseplants around the house and when I walk by I get a whiff. My son has asthma and it&#x27;s too cool lately to provide a lot of ventilation to burn sticks. But I HAVE burned this and when it was finished the wonderful aroma stayed in the air for hours after. The unburned sticks I have sticking out everywhere continue to have a wonderful scent wafting in the air as I walk by them. I&#x27;m addicted and just ordered more.</li>
    <li> Best quality incense I have come across!</li>
    <li> This incense is awesome!  The scent is divine and I love it so much I&#x27;m going to have to order 2 more boxes soon.  Your home will smell like a temple or sanctuary.  I love it!!  I always buy Hem incnese and this one is my favorite for sure.</li>
    <li> Came on time...it&#x27;s great and convenient buying this product.</li>
    <li> Love the incense, the smell is awesome, fast delivery well pleased</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I got them earlier than I suppose to, that was great! It is the first time I get frankincense and myrrh, I love it it has a fresh smell very original</li>
    <li> JUST DOES NOT LIVE UP TO IT SCENT</li>
    <li> Smaller sticks, hard to light..and miniscule fragrance. No one makes good incense anymore :-( How much more would it cost HEM to use a bit stronger oil, for heavens sake!</li>
    <li> Love this combination</li>
    <li> Very pleased with both the quality and the the fragrance blend of these incense sticks.  I was looking for something that captured the memory of the incense burned during certain ceremonies at Catholic mass during childhood.  This captured that scent in a way that was accurate and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> As other buyers have stated, the fragrance lingers thru the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Very well pkgd. Both in the box and mail pkg.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for price, I&#x27;m ordering more Hem incense sticks from Amazon,in different scents!</li>
    <li> I should have brought more, because I love the smell of this incense,,I will buy again and soon, and will and have recommended to friends and family.... Wonderful... Thank you....</li>
    <li> really nice smell, will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Candles are usually \\&quot;my thing\\&quot;.  But I wanted our daughter to smell the smells of two of the Wise Men.  After seeing all that I would need to get for REAL frankincense and myrrh, I decided this might be better.  My view was that we would have it all through the Christmas season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it smells heavenly.  And the price cannot be beaten.  But there must be enough incense to run a small incense stand or something.  I bought this in DECEMBER and it is now JUNE and we are still using it and haven&#x27;t run through the entire thing, maybe half.  We use it quite a bit, too, mostly in the bathroom.  Of course we air our house out and have fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think we might have enough for this coming Christmas. I am not joking.&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this is for the scent of my childhood Catholic church. While this is close, it is still a nice scent. The sticks burn really well, and last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I received the incense extremely fast and it was packaged nicely. This incense smells amazing and it relaxing and excellent for meditation and cleansing a room. I will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> So many types of incense have a harsh base note and an artificial overtone for which the product receives it&#x27;s name. This is not the case with this product.  I am delighted each time I light one of these Frankincense and Myrrh sticks.  This gentle ...smooth fragrance is a combination of exotic flavors in a perfect symphony.  I would have given it 5 stars if they would burn longer.  With this price you can just burn another.  Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Awesome cense! Not too heavy and not too light.</li>
    <li> I have searched for incense that has a long-lasting scent that is also appealing, fresh, &amp; clean...THIS IS IT!!! And the number of 10 packs in the order makes very much worth the price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better incense purchase.</li>
    <li> Updated November 2014:  I have used these several times now and really like them.  I hope the scent isn&#x27;t too strong because too me it is fantastic.  I have burned the sticks mainly in the fall but  they are suitable (in my mind) from September to March.  Lovely blend evoking holiday yes but also a cosy home.  Not so suitable for sunny summer unless when is camping in the woods. I recommend these fragrant sticks.  So much so I think I will go light another one right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review: I really need to get a better incense stick burner because I am enamored of these Frankincense and Myrrh sticks.  Very nice.  Look forward to using them more during the holiday season.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good quality incense for a good price. I will be ordering HEM frankincense and myrrh incense again.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, HEM sets a standard for quality incense sticks. This product is a combination of two of my favorite fragrances. It is very good, but does not effuse as potent a fragrance as compared to separate sticks of Frankincense and Myhrh. But, I would highly recommend this product for most who share a like for the purifying  aroma of Frankincense and Myrrh incense.</li>
    <li> years ago this brand used to be great, but i had to throw out the entire box this time - i have a feeling they switched from natural to some kind of an artificial/chemical process.  its smells absolutely rancid</li>
    <li> Great quality, not overpowering, nicely packaged and easy to burn.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to think about this. I ordered from HEM because I love the smell of their patchouli. It smells so incredible So, Naturally, I would assume the rest of their incense would. While it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, I was expecting a bit more of a natural smell. It smells a little perfume-y to me. I can smell a little earthy-ness to it, but I was hoping for something a little more natural. Still, it smells fine and will suffice until my next incense purchase. And realistically, I would rate it 3.5. 3 is too low and 4 is too high. But, whatev.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this sent. Great product lasts and long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent price.  You get a lot for your money.  Works Excellent as well. No problems.  Would buy this brand again</li>
    <li> Great aroma, long lasting, amazing value.</li>
    <li> The smell of this incense is very nice,  fragrant. I love it a lot. I would recommend for any purposes. AAA++</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and quality oils. They are easy to light and burn perfect. I also bought the same scent in Tulasi and I give the same feedback.</li>
    <li> Love the Church-like fragrances. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> these incense smell wonderful, if there was one complaint it would be that they burn out too quickly. that aside, i will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> No too intense and relaxing. Sticks burn all the way to the end. I use to meditate and when going to bed.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of church when they utilize Myrrh. These sticks make my house smell just like that - love it! You get a TON of sticks for the price, too.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell but it burns out to quickly I had to use two at a time to get the room to smell like the product</li>
    <li> I love Frankincense and Myrrh and HEM brand incense is the REAL DEAL! It has a very nostalgic scent and will remind most of church when they were little. Widely used for ceremonies it has a very distinctive scent that lasts for quite some time. This particular brand of incense burns very clean and doesn&#x27;t smoke very much at all. Not to be compared with cheap 10 for $1 style incense you see at mall kiosks. This is great stuff! Six 20 gram tubes offer&#x27;s plenty for you to burn and share with other&#x27;s if you choose. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just got the incence today, and tried it out. Seems to be nice fragrance  so far.  These  incense  are from  india,  &amp;#34;Hem&amp;#34; manufacturers a leading and quality  incense maker.</li>
    <li> I was surprised it shipped so fast and when i lit them they smelled just like im used to using. Frankincense. Just like in church. Very soothing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful incense!  Smells sweet yet woody.  Very pleased. Packaged extremely well.  Burns well too.</li>
    <li> I am a big incense fan but this does not do frankincense and myrrh justice. It seems quite generic and not truly these two wonderful medicinal oils. It just seems too perfumey rather than the essence of these historic scents. But to each his own. Some may truly like this brand.</li>
    <li> I just received my purchase today and I am sooooo in love with this smell.... It is the best smell ever...... I just sparked 2 of them and the smell lasted about an hour or so but it was amazing to smell this scent... I will definitely give it the 5 stars and recommend it to anyone that likes this great scent of Frankincense and Myrrh..... God bless you all....</li>
    <li> I like the smell, it wasn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;cathedral&amp;#34; type smell I was looking for, but definitely don&#x27;t avoid burning it.</li>
    <li> awsome scent  fast standard delivery  slow burning  great product</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase. The service was prompt and the product is wonderful. I was looking for some incense to burn for when I pray and meditate that reminded me of the catholic church I attended as a young girl. The scent is spot on and very pleasant. Some incense don&#x27;t  smell like what they are supposed to when they are burned but these really do! I will buy these again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I just love this brand and will always buy it ..The scent will last a long time and is so pleasant.  A+</li>
    <li> This smells just like the incense they use at my parrish for mass. I love it.</li>
    <li> I buy this because I love the smell of frankincense but I find it a bit much to burn alone. This has a nice pleasant calming scent and cuts down on that twang I smell from straight up frankincense. This arrived before the estimated arrival date and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is that sometimes the part of the stick that goes into the holder can be quite thin which makes it difficult to keep if from bending down onto the holder. On average (I buy this a lot, though not always from Amazon) I find at least one stick per individual box, sometimes two that are like this.  I&#x27;ve learned to save a spent stick and wrap it to these thin ones with a thin wire.  Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to burn 1-2/ box...which adds up to a lot of wasted sticks when you burn as much as I do while I work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 5 stars because I just plain love how it smells.</li>
    <li> I have ordered it twice...I give it with my holiday gifts....will probably buy it again next year.  like it alot !!!  MBB</li>
    <li> This is high quality incense. I really enjoy it and use it all the time. I have purchased several boxes already and intend to purchase more. Beware; this incense is very strong. It is not the watered down stuff you find on Ebay or your local store. This stuff comes directly from India. You get your monies worth with this product. Personally, I love the small and would settle for nothing less. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like loose resin and charcoal they use in church, but this is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far.  Plenty of sticks for the money.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, it smells awesome.</li>
    <li> smells so good, would buy this product again. burns for a long time. item is exactly as described. the end.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this particular Myrrh incense which is why I decided to go ahead and purchase it. It is &#x27;as advertised&#x27; and more. Very pleased and just ordered a second box. Great quality, price and customer service/shipping. Heartily recommended!</li>
    <li> While it is not as fragrant as the Myrrh, I still like the scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most nicest incense I have smelled.</li>
    <li> Exactly the size I was looking for.  Purchased sage on another site and recieved a quarter of this size.  I would recommend buying here.  Shipped promptly and packed right.</li>
    <li> Even if it does not smell exactly like the resins it does have a good scent it is calming and relaxing I do think out of all HEM brand incense I have tried this has to be the best one</li>
    <li> They have a very nice aroma. I’ll buy these again.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Great product! Love it. Just what I wanted. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Much more than I expected.</li>
    <li> I resent being required to write an effusive review to satisfy someone&#x27;s ego, and having a word requirement. I&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, I&#x27;ve summarized good feelings in a headline, and that should be sufficient. This is my standard response. If I didn&#x27;t like it, or only gave 1 star, then you can require an essay.</li>
    <li> Its high quality incense but smells not at all like I expected-sort of a &amp;#34;choke you out&amp;#34; medicinal smell.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scent combinations for incense - perfect for getting into the holiday spirit or just adding a special note to your lazy Sunday.  Love the big size, too.  With 6 little boxes in 1, they&#x27;re great for giving as gifts.</li>
    <li> Very good incense. Strong enough that you don&#x27;t need to light it for a nice effect.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Burns every orifice and your skin. Smells like burning glue or some other chemical. Linger is very, very strong.</li>
    <li> This was said to be used back in ancient times.  In the Bible it was said to be a gift given to Jesus.  If you are religious or not, it seems to give a feeling of spirituality.  Nice to be used in quiet prayer or mediation.  Good for spiritual reading too.</li>
    <li> these have a wonderful smell and pure white smoke  excellent</li>
    <li> These are perfect. The right scent, not overpowering. When I am feeling stressed I light one and it relaxes my mind.  For the price and quality, this product is an absolute STEAL!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best frankincense and myrrh incense I&#x27;ve ever burned. It smells just a tad sweeter than different brands had to offer, which is just fine with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent also lingers for hours, sometimes DAYS after one being burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEM has never failed me in their incense production. I love this brand and will continue to stick with it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and classic.</li>
    <li> Good product dilivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these two together. Great buy too.</li>
    <li> As previously noted, I have been pleased with all HEM incense products I have tried. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I had bought this at an Indian grocery several years ago, but have not seen it in any stores since then.  I like how it blends both fragrances.  I like myrrh on it&#x27;s own, but frankincense is too strong for me.  This is a nice blend.</li>
    <li> I must say thank you  and the package, incense and everything has arrived in pristine conditioned and I will buy again soon !.again and again....excellent price and timely delivery..as always..</li>
    <li> The box is a really great value and it&#x27;s going to last me a while! This scent is classic to me, it definitely smells very much akin to the incense they use in the Catholic Church (well the Churches I&#x27;ve been to, I understand that different places have different variations of incense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They burn quite slowly, some of them are messy because the fibers in the middle don&#x27;t completely burn off so you&#x27;re left with like a ash covered stick. Other ones just burn magnificently, you can&#x27;t expect them all to be perfect though. The smell is very much the same, in some other incense sticks I&#x27;d notice a variation in scents for each pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very wonderful scent though, I really enjoy it. I doesn&#x27;t overpower that much (also depends how big is the room), and it lingers a bit but not too long which I really like too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for Christmas season. Wellmade, strong, burns evenly.alot of incense for the price</li>
    <li> This type of incense gives off a rather heavy fragrance. It leaves a fragrance that I cannot use around any of my family members or friends with allergies. Interesting fragrance that would be good in a very large room with high ceilings.</li>
    <li> Smoky, but does have the scent of church that I was looking for..........</li>
    <li> One of my absolute favorites to burn! We just bought this box and we&#x27;re quickly going through it. The house smells so amazing and it lingers like a sweet guest. It&#x27;s not overly pungent like some can be (where you wished you never lit it), and it smells like the stick when it burns (instead of many bait-and-switch incense sticks).&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Not disappointed. They were a little shorter than I had expected,but the Potency definitely makes up for that &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; coming :) will buy again when I run out,(or before then!).</li>
    <li> The best scent I&#x27;ve encountered so far. Really exotic, entrancing, but not sickeningly sweet or overpowering.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the smell you&#x27;d get in a church, but this was a much more earthy, musky smell. Not very pleasant, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> A very sweet and slightly musky scent.  I like burning them occasionally, too many back to back and the smoke is overwhelming.  I this this HEM Frank&#x27;n&#x27;Myrrh is one of the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> these people probably stay in business only because low cost items are a pain to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there was NO, REPEAT, NO scent of frankincense and myrrh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; there was some generic odor of stick incense. period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the people who say real f and m cost lots are correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m tossing this.</li>
    <li> As a regular incense burner, I am very VERY pleased with this product. I usually spend and arm and a leg at my local metaphysical shop for a good quality incense. I would first like to point out, you get an INSANE amount of sticks in this box. I did not realize how much I would be receiving, and I am very happy about that. You receive a lot for you money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell....its incredible. It is strong, yet not over powering. It has a very spiritual smell to it...if spirituality can have a smell, it is the smell of this incense. And the burning time...these last FOREVER. I have never burned an incense with such a long lasting burning period. This product was well worth it, and I will be ordering again (when I run out, which wont be fore a while) I usually burn 2-4 sticks a day, and I still have not reached the end of my first box yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is very simple, I am 110% happy with this purchase. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys burning incense sticks. Makes the house smell fabulous, and makes me feel like I am taking a walk back into biblical times. Thank you, seller!</li>
    <li> This is the best Frankincense and Myrrh incense you can get. It comes in a very attractive and well protected box, to preserve the sticks, very fast shipping. I definitively recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent the most!  Cannot beat this price.  Normally 1 individual box is $3-4 in my area.  Will order again :)</li>
    <li> Nope, every single bit of incense from this company smells fairly standard/gross to me. All have that &amp;#34;incense you bought from some hippy&amp;#34; smell. Meh! Fine if you like that, and a great price, but its going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat price, prompt service</li>
    <li> I once went into a shop in New York back in the 80&#x27;s and this shop was filled with the smell of Frankincense and Myrrh, I didn&#x27;t know it at the time but I looked for a very long time to find it. Back then they weren&#x27;t packaged like they are now so I didn&#x27;t know what to buy so I stopped looking and stopped burning. Just recently I had a desire to burn Incense again so I picked this one because it felt spiritual and when I lit it it took me right back to that shop in New York. I&#x27;m hooked. Will continue to burn but this one by far is my favorite.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> These are much bigger sticks than what I have purchased directly from the company (HEM) in the past.  I don&#x27;t think there is a more lovely scent than Frankincense and Myrrh!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a quality incense with a high oil content ,this is the one for you...and the price can&#x27;t be beat...I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  My husband did not like the smell of most candles that I burned.  He has never complained about the smell of the Frankincense and myrrh from the HEM incense.  I burn it at least once a day,  I love the smell.  I burn it because I love the smell. The spirit it keeps away at my house is a complaining husband.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.each little tub inside of the large box is individualy wrapped in plastic. Scent is very nice.</li>
    <li> Nothing But Burning Wood Smell. You Can buy better incense at Publix or your local flea market. This stuff is total crap, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> most of the sticks were like 2 were clumped into one stick..might had been rejects...smelled like burning wood to me either it was old or either I just got a bad deal</li>
    <li> Just received this today, and already burned 2 sticks! Comes packaged in a box containing six sealed tubes. Each tube in turn holds a sealed bag that contains the actual incense sticks.  Having some experience handling and mixing high quality essential oils, I can vouch for the quality of the aromatic resins used in this product. Each stick comes very well-coated, with very little \\&quot;fall-off\\&quot; (bits of incense that flake off as \\&quot;dust\\&quot; in the bottom of the bag during shipping.)  The sticks light easily and burn evenly for about an hour each. The scent is pleasant, with a strong woody component that is in no way overwhelming or \\&quot;perfumy.\\&quot; The scent lingers for some time after burning, and leaves a clean and pleasing smell in the area for a couple hours afterward. For the cost and the quantity and quality of the product, I enthusiastically give five stars!</li>
    <li> This product smells exactly like the resin incense used in my local Catholic church.  The fragrance is strong, yet peaceful &amp; familiar.  This is my first time using incense sticks and, I have to say, I am very impressed with the quality of the scent!  I will definitely be recommending this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this scent in any form it comes in because of it&#x27;s natural fragrance. It&#x27;s light and gentle on the eyes...the smoke evaporates quickly from the sticks especially if you have some form of ventilation; window or small fan. Better for medium-large vented area, even on the balcony. Try it for the holiday parties!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, but!  the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger like other incense.  That could be a good thing for some people.  For me I like it when I can smell it hours afterwards, specially since my bedroom is very small.  I would like it to last longer.  Excellent deal for the money.  And I really like the fragrance.  Am going to try out some other scents from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> This smells nothing like any of the F&amp;M I have used ever....The stink is overbearing and choke&#x27;s me up.. I would not like this even if it did not affect me..But to each their own , glad someone likes it...~!~&lt;br /&gt;I must add though it got here extremely fast , and well packed...I don&#x27;t in any way fault the seller...I will do business again for sure, just not this one..~!~</li>
    <li> Love these incense.  They smell beautiful.  I need to order more, we are half way through the box already.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of incense, mainly of the &#x27;oriental scents&#x27;. I do not like the &#x27;fruity&#x27; incense sticks. I like both this and the patchouli scents in this brand, the only 2 I have tried. This one seems slightly &#x27;smokier&#x27; than the patchouli version, but I like both. You get a lot for the money. They take a few seconds to get going, and are a bit smokey until they catch, but burn smoothly once they get going.</li>
    <li> A must have to clear your space.</li>
    <li> not my favorite flavor, but great quality stuff</li>
    <li> There are several HEM incense scents that I use on a daily basis.  This and Myrrh are my total favs.  It actually smells like what its supposed to be, so if you are going for the &amp;#34;in the can sweet scent pretend to be&amp;#34; sort of thing bought in many stores, today...this will be too powerful for you.  If, like me, you want the full brew sort of thing, you&#x27;re gonna love it.&lt;br /&gt;  One problem I have is a lot of difference between stick sizes.. this means some will not fit in a horizontal incense holder.  Since I have both horizontal and vertical, its not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, can not beat the price!</li>
    <li> Each stick lasts about 1:15 minutes. Smells great - not exactly a &amp;#34;Catholic Church&amp;#34; smell, but close enough to set a mood for mediation and reflection.</li>
    <li> HEM incense are filled with scented oils that give a genuine smell and they burn slowly. These are the best incense I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> The lady who received this was delighted</li>
    <li> Stuff always makes me sneeze.</li>
    <li> I cannot say I was that familiar with the smell of Frankincense and Myrrh other than the biblical references with the original Christmas gift but now it will be always be with me. It&#x27;s now one of my favorites. As with all the Hem products I&#x27;ve tried you get what you ordered so if you&#x27;re looking for a classic combo then is for you.</li>
    <li> This is great! I wasn&#x27;t sure about how I&#x27;d like a &#x27;musky&#x27; type scent, as I&#x27;d never tried one before, but I found I really do like this. I had never tried either &#x27;Frankincense&#x27; or &#x27;Myrrh&#x27; before, but now I have, and am glad I did! I can&#x27;t explain this scent, other than to say it smells like &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&#x27; and &#x27;Bergamot&#x27; (both from HEM) together, but a bit more &#x27;musky&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong smell. I ordered this because I thoroughly enjoy the Nubian Frankincense and Myrrh soap that I use. This scent is very strong. And a bit different from the soap that I use. Maybe because its so strong its hard to compare to the nice soft scented soap I use. Regardless, it burns fast. And once its almost burned out it softens out and i appreciate it more.  My burner is upside down type so this burns fast and is a might strong.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected from a Frank-&amp;-Myrrh ... more floral, more citrus ... but I like it nonetheless.  Reminds me of a Supa Dupa product I used to burn.  One thing, though, stuff burns FAST, very FAST (3x the speed of the Nag Champa I usually use).</li>
    <li> I bought these due to the reasonable price for the quantity.  They do burn quicker than stated, but the aroma is very nice.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of incense and often return orders because they don&#x27;t burn properly or have a strong \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; undertone. This has none of those.  It burns evenly, has a pleasant smell, and is a good value for what you are receiving.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I will definitely order from this company again. Many frankincense and myrrh incense is not of good quality or even the right combination. This is real frankincense and myrrh and burns very evenly and the scent is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is best incense ever not only for smell but also to cleanse the space with good energy. This is my second time ordering and wouldnt to use it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand and scent in the past, but never from this seller. The incense I received does not smell like Frankincense and Myrrh at all. Do not waste your money with this product.</li>
    <li> I burn incense daily and thought this would be a good one to burn around the holidays.  Also, since you get six individual boxes of around twenty sticks each (give or take a couple...it&#x27;s packed by weight), I thought it&#x27;d make a nice stocking-stuffer for my incense-burning friends.  I&#x27;m not sure how authentic the frankincense and myrrh scent is, but it is alot stonger-smelling than most incense I burn.  It&#x27;s a pleasant scent...kinda \\&quot;churchy\\&quot; and woodsy/flowery at the same time.  I&#x27;m used to paying a couple dollars less for this brand, which I purchase at my local indian grocery, but they don&#x27;t carry this particular variety.  I&#x27;ve taken off one star for the slightly inflated price, but it&#x27;s a good product if you like stronger-smelling incense.  Item arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  The HEM incense sticks are packed very well in cool hexagonal-shaped boxes with a rigid cardboard tube inside and the sticks sealed in a plastic (sometimes more wax-papery) bag.  HEM&#x27;s a great, reasonably-priced incense I find burns consistently well (with the exception of the \\&quot;coconut\\&quot; scent, which almost always burns out too soon!).</li>
    <li> The seller did a fine job...the product shipped promptly, the order was accurately filled, and so forth.  So I would not hesitate to use this seller again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product...Frankincense and Myrrh insence, just did&#x27;t smell very good.  I would not consider purchasing this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; or scent of insence again.</li>
    <li> .....very happy with this item!! In fact even gave it as a gift too!</li>
    <li> These smell great and last quite a while.</li>
    <li> The ends of the sticks are frazzled.. Other than that a nice product.</li>
    <li> Sweet and smoky aroma. Has to stay lit awhile to keep it from finding out. The smoke is a heavy stream but dissipates quickly. It burns on a stick if you are looking for traditional then pay more! :-) I alternate this and morning stars sandalwood.</li>
    <li> This is the clearest, cleanest frankincense I have ever used.  I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great out of the package, but once burned, leaves a lingering old lady/cheap perfume smell in the air.  Suddenly it goes from blissful to smelling like a nursing home.  Stay away from these.</li>
    <li> The best incense you&#x27;ll ever buy</li>
    <li> You can read my previous review on the Dragons Blood HEM Incense for a full review of incense but basically this is one of our favorite scents in this line.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but it surely will permeate your room with a wonderful smell that lasts longer than candles or room spray!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. As always, it arrived early and intact. As always, the productt is fresh and lasts for over an hour. The combination of these scents - Frankincense and Myrrh - is light and intoxicating. I use it when i am entertaining without the worry of overwhelming any of my guests. Leave the house smelling fresh for hours after.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good scent, I like it alot, Lots of people do. I really like mixing it with Egyptian musk or amber. 5 stars well deserved.</li>
    <li> Great value and the scent is wonderful.  The incense burns rather well and the scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love this combination</li>
    <li> This is a lot of incense for the price so I expected that it might lack quality.  I was wrong.  It smells super good!  Even unlit it fills my candle closet with a very nice scent.  I actually like the unlit smell (although lit is good too) I cut it up and added it to some sachets I made.  Very good stuff.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell. Leaved my house smelling really good! Super faster deliver.&lt;br /&gt;I Will surely become a regular costumer. Recomended</li>
    <li> this incense smells like urine. big disappointment, waste of money. idk what i expected for this price honestly. not sure what the 90+ positive reviews are even talking about. trust me, you dont want to buy this.</li>
    <li> I will always buy these!  They&#x27;re not overpowering like some, and smell great!  The best part is the price, I was kind of worried at first becuase it seemed to be such a great deal, however, after using these for a while I would definately recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling incense without much smoke</li>
    <li> smells of oil, not resin; nice while it is burning but it does not linger in the air after - not going to buy this brand again myself, but if you like the perfume oil scent you will enjoy this</li>
    <li> This smells good, but doesnt burn well. Maybe I got a bad batch? But I will keep trying. It only burned about halfway and then went out by itself.</li>
    <li> I got this one and the Sandalwood Incense by Morning Star.  This one was weak in that the smell did not travel too far.  The sandalwood incense seemed to imbue the entire apartment with a pleasant smell.  Maybe this one is not as high quality.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my home smelling nice and fresh! It combines both frankincense and myrrh into a nice convient stick scent. The sticks of the HEM are thick, so they do produce lots of smoke, ash and scent. These are more like the indian style and would not be suitable for the smaller Japanese incense holders.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a disappointment! These do not smell even a little tiny bit like F&amp;M at all, not at all!  I do have actual real F&amp;M and I know what it smells like.  I attend a traditional church regularly that still uses F&amp;M incense as well.  I wanted a cheaper and easier to use alternative but this isn&#x27;t it! I know what F&amp;M smells like and this isn&#x27;t even related to it.  Maybe I got a batch completely mislabeled at the factory or something but this is truly awful to claim it is F&amp;M if it was done on purpose. In the past I have bought cheap incense that was many times over closer to smelling like real F&amp;M than this (though still way off as well).  This doesn&#x27;t even have a hint of smelling right at all, as in zero.  Going to see about a refund which normally I would not do on something where there is some subjectivity to the sense of smell, but with these I just really feel like they pulled a fast one on me or something because these are so off the mark as to make me think they never even tried to get it right. If you want to know what they actually do smell like I would say very heavily perfumed and slightly musky sweet potpourri in a room someone smoked a cigarette in and left a dirty ashtray. I can actually still seriously TASTE the flowery and perfumy stench of this.</li>
    <li> you will be disappointed if your know incense. This smells like perfume, nothing like frankincense and Myrrh.  False advertising.  Doesnt burn correctly and gives me hives when I smell it. Total waste of money.  To all the 5 star folks, come on really, Thanks for wasting my money.  Karma&#x27;s a bitch.</li>
    <li> I thought these would bring some sort of happiness or joy to my sense of smell, but unfortunately these stink.  There are so many in the box and I can&#x27;t even give these stinkers away.  I use them every once in a while in the bathroom still, since I have them.</li>
    <li> This is great smelling incense at a great price. It reminds me of church incense, in a good way (not quite as strong as what they use in the church!). I have used HEM products before and have been consistently happy with their incense sticks. My only slight complaint is that I wish their sticks burned longer. They do burn up rather quickly, especially when compared with other incense sticks from India (Satya, for example). However, the great price helps to offset this issue, somewhat. I highly recommend that people try this scent. It is heavenly!</li>
    <li> Every thing went fine with the order, got here fast.  I have had no trouble keeping them lit.  I make sure I have about a 1/4 inch of &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; before blowing out the flame.</li>
    <li> Pungent ashy aroma.  I keep some around for the holidays only and gifted the rest.  I like a strong incense as long as there is a sweet or even a semisweet overtone but this is way over my threshold.</li>
    <li> wonderful fragrance for the season</li>
    <li> I like it my mom doesn&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s for me.</li>
    <li> This was not the strongest or the best smelling Frankincense and Myrrh I&#x27;ve ever had. However it is very pleasant and I&#x27;m enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;I think HEM makes quality incense and have no issue with their products, I find mixing this Frankincense and Myrrh with HEM  &amp;#34;Good Fortune&amp;#34; is a very special and compatible match. They feel balanced,  the spiritual with the earthly. Good Fortune smells like leaving a multi millionaires den and Frankincense and Myrrh is going to Church or a place for meditation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the beauty of incense, for me at least. creating the mood. In the times were living in, everyone needs a sanctuary. Hem incense don&#x27;t cost a lot and they give you plenty of sticks for your bucks. I wanted to try the higher priced Frankincense and Myrrh here on Amazon, at the time I placed my order for this the other brand was &amp;#34;currently unavailable&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad, since this didn&#x27;t disappoint and it was a better deal. Thank you to Atharva the seller, who got the Frankincense and Myrrh to me in a timely manner and packaged well. Also the price was right. IF my review has helped, please click yes below. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The container containing the boxes of sticks was a little worn.  The box sticks seem fresh.</li>
    <li> Manufacture did awesome on this product, definitely will but more in the future! Seller was great! Like all things you never know what ur gonna get but this is great!</li>
    <li> Like all the other reviews, I have been searching and searching for the peaceful,calming scent of the catholic church rituals and I finally found the right one.  I&#x27;m even more pleased because it was the first one I tried and I hit the jackpot.  I am obsessed with the scent of this incense.  The scent is just like the one used in church.  I have been burning one every single day since it arrived.  It is a great bargain and you get alot of incense sticks for the price you pay.  The quality is very good.  It burns slowly but be careful when you first light it.  Do not blow on it near paper.  Once lit put it on a secure incense holder and enjoy the heavenly scent.  I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
