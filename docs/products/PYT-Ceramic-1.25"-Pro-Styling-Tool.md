    <li> I bought one for me from the real talk show then i loved it so much i bought my daughter one when she came home from the army</li>
    <li> Worked for 10 min then one heating element quit, customer service can not be reached wrong number posted online.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again. :(</li>
    <li> Came quick. Girlfriend loves it. Works like any new PYT flat iron which is great. Pick a color she&#x27;s never had :) worked well and it&#x27;s probably cheaper than the one she has.</li>

    <li> I was given one for Christmas and was very skeptical as I have always spent $200 + on a good quality straightener.  I must say I LOVE it.  The curls I get are amazing and last for 3 days (by the third day it&#x27;s more like beachy waves but still looks awesome).  I also love the cord that spins so it doesn&#x27;t get twisted and knotted.  I see comments on here about people getting refurbished ones but those reviews should be going towards the mall kiosks they bought them at for reselling defective product.  I also recommend getting the stand that goes with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this purple flat iron and it burned my hair out in the front to the point that I couldn&#x27;t wear my hair in a ponytail without my hair sticking up in the front due to being burned out from these flat irons. I&#x27;ll never buy this product again.</li>

When i received it the product wasn&#x27;t new and look refurbished not to mention it doesn&#x27;t  work properly...it doesn&#x27;t stay heated!! i hate my product it was a waste of money and i would never recommend or buy a product from this seller again!</li>
    <li> We saw at mall and had to buy. Seems like quality is good, but still using old iron from Sally Beauty Supply. I will provide another update if used more.</li>
    <li> This by far is my favorite flat iron. This is my second pyt flat iron, &amp; I&#x27;m more than satisfied. They are very long lasting and I straighten my hair in about 20 min.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair out sometimes. I am glad that I didn&#x27;t pay full retail price for it. I do like the way it straightens my hair.</li>
    <li> although the lifetime warranty was voided when the iron was  purchased through amamzon the device is amazing.  i love it.  all mixed girls need this iron</li>
    <li> Came in a dusty box......flat iron was scratched up and plates are loose.  I guess what can I expect for $40??</li>
    <li> This is the best thing my hair has expierenced. EVER! I The purple is a fantastic color and it has grips when holding making it effortless to style my hair.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive flat iron. Has a nice start and stop button. It heats up quickly and does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Love this product.. it works great on any type of hair.. :)</li>
    <li> This product is seen in malls for double the price!  My daughter loves it and now have to buy another one for the other daughter!</li>
    <li> I got it for my mom although i got the same one with cheetah print blue and white she loves it more than me it more than i love mines my hair is really long and wavy so it just doesn&#x27;t straighten as i thought it would. But my mom loves her it does straighten hers she uses it faithfully</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the iron itself but there were small scratches and dull corners on the plastic.  I could tell it was from being set on it&#x27;s sides from repeated use. I think it was refurbished, I don&#x27;t like that misrepresentation.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last me given it&#x27;s unknown age.</li>
    <li> They heat up quick and work really well!</li>
