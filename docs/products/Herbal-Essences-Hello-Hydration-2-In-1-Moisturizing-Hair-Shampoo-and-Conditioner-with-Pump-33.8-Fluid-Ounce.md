      <li>I am a product junkie and have tried many detanglers.</li>

      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even tell you how many times people come up to me at school and work just to sniff my hair - they can even smell it from a distance.</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have heard so many nice things about this conditioner but when a friend of mine who has natural 3C hair told me that she used this conditioner and loved it, I knew I had to try it.</li>

      <li>Its HUGE.</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge.</li>
      <li>i am so happy I got this in 3 days with standard shipping!</li>
      <li>Wish it was still available through the subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t help my fly aways and frizz.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I use a generous amount because it&#x27;s so cheap, but you shouldn&#x27;t -need-</li>
      <li>It stays light and shiny throughout the day.</li>
      <li>The smell of the conditioner is great and lasts all day long.  </li>

      <li>Great products for dry hair...as well as the shampoo..</li>
      <li>I mean the shampoo I use plays a great roll, but this conditioner goes hand in hand with it nicely.</li>
      <li>This is a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; conditioner, but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>good to the last drop.</li>
      <li>I love this product in particular because it comes with the pump</li>
      <li>B006YQ41VI Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo, Mango, 10 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>Great value for the price, much cheaper than sold in the local pharmacy.</li>
      <li>USING WHAT WORKS BETTER THAN HIGH BUCK  STUFF</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is great - very strong and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Best I have found for use with curls and hard water!  </li>
      <li>However I noticed significant hair breakage after using the Herbal Essence Hydration Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for the first time.</li>
      <li>I used with it with the tightly curly method to make finger coils/doodles and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>Cheap and really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many conditioners but nothing is as good as this one for my African American hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product and it is not bad, it smells nice, it is thick and moisturizing but I have tried better for my hair.</li>
      <li>The bottles are practically full I didn&#x27;t want to waste the content, so I figured I would try the Herbal Essence Hydration shampoo and conditioner one more time just to make sure.</li>
      <li>I discovered is that when used with a little water and a shaving brush I quickly found that it is better than bath soap that irritates my face in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff smells really good, is really rich, spreads easily through my thick hair, and moisturizes it really well.</li>
      <li>I have natural African-American hair and it makes my hair so soft and nice</li>
      <li>I have always liked this conditioner, leaves hair soft, not always soft enough for me (since I have pretty dry hair) but if you have only slightly dried hair then this would be a Godsend for you...plus at its great price, its a great conditioner to have on hand :)</li>
      <li>Very much prefer my S Factor to this one when I can afford it.</li>
      <li>As expected this conditioner smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and the delivery of it was so fast.hopefully when I run out I can come back and find another bottle with the pump</li>
      <li>and I loooooove how it keeps my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>After the first use I went online to find a vat of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I would not suggest applying and going to detangling the same section immediately, like many YouTube videos demonstrate.</li>
      <li>The best characteristic of this conditioner is hands down the smell!</li>
      <li>and I was going to throw the products in the garbage because I don&#x27;t want to loose any more hair for the sake of getting my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using it for awhile to try other conditioners again but to no avail this is hands down the best.</li>
      <li>so detangling hair is pretty easy, I am able to use only my finger tips to comb through my curls but everyones hair is different</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this for my co-wash every single day and I loooooove how it keeps my hair soft and smooth.  The moisture always wakes up as soon as I rinse it out.  Love the smell and the pump bottle for in shower use.</li>
    <li> I am African American, and hair is very kinky. It moisturizes my hair well,and I also mix it with water as a leave in conditioner. I will herbal essence would come out with an organic line!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the Herbal Essence Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner because I noticed all of the good ratings, I remembered the television advertisements and because the product contains coconut which is supposed to be good for hair health. When the product arrived, I noticed that the bottle is a great value (large product for a good price) and the product smells great. The downside was that I noticed that the products contain some ingredients not good for hair (ie. both the shampoo and conditioner contain sulfate and dimethicone) but I figured that unfortunately most shampoo products contain those ingredients. However I noticed significant hair breakage after using the Herbal Essence Hydration Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for the first time. The next week I switched back to my original shampoo and conditioner and everything was fine. The bottles are practically full I didn&#x27;t want to waste the content, so I figured I would try the Herbal Essence Hydration shampoo and conditioner one more time just to make sure. But I just revisited the Amazon.com customer reviews and viewed a different set of reviews and I noticed that quite a few other customers also experienced hair loss. At this point, I am not going to use the shampoo and conditioner again and I was going to throw the products in the garbage because I don&#x27;t want to loose any more hair for the sake of getting my money&#x27;s worth.  I ended up calling the customer service department and the rep was very helpful - she gave me a refund and she indicated that the product could have been an isolated issue with the particular batch of shampoos in the production process but she was not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, The products did not meet my expectations. Buyer Beware!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again but everyone&#x27;s hair type is different so I can&#x27;t advise whether or not others will have the same experience that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LINK TO CUSTOMER RATINGS:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Herbal-Essences-Hydration-Moisturizing-Shampoo/product-reviews/B003AYEG4E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_hist_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;filterBy&#x3D;addOneStar&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0</li>
    <li> Great value for the price, much cheaper than sold in the local pharmacy. It works like conditioiner- not sure what else to say. Detangles well and smells great.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite conditioners! I have super dry hair. I use this to detangle my hair a day before I wash it. I spritz my hair with water, and put some of this conditioner on. It makes detangling 10X&#x27;s easier and faster! I also use this as a base for my hair masks. My transitioning hair is always soft, easy to work with, moisturized, and soft after using this. Sometimes I use it as a deep conditioner by conditioning overnight with it. I also love the size omg! All conditioner should come in a large bottle like this. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the scent! It smells heavenly! Like a tropical paradise! I will definitely continue to use this. *This does contain silicones!* Some people don&#x27;t like that, but I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product.  It softens and gives body to the hair and this leads to other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered is that when used with a little water and a shaving brush I quickly found that it is better than bath soap that irritates my face in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO IRRITATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOFTENS BEARD BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGHTENS SKIN DURING USE AND THE SKIN STAYS TIGHT FOR A LONG TIME.  (THERE COMES A TIME WHEN NOT LOOKING LIKE A DRIED PRUNE IS GOOD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS AS GOOD AS ANY AFTER SHAVE LOTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP  LIKE ME WHEN IT COMES TO  USING WHAT WORKS BETTER THAN HIGH BUCK  STUFF</li>
    <li> I have heard so many nice things about this conditioner but when a friend of mine who has natural 3C hair told me that she used this conditioner and loved it, I knew I had to try it. It makes my relaxed hair soft and I also use it as a leave-in conditioner for my daughter with natural hair: it makes her hair soft too.</li>
    <li> I use this with my natural curly hair!  I never had any problems with it! It does its job and moisturizes my hair!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for my co-wash.</li>
    <li> love it for my hair.. it&#x27;s not heavy on my hair and i don&#x27;t feel it makes it frizzy either.</li>
    <li> As expected this conditioner smells amazing. It&#x27;s very moisturizing the scent says with your hair. It&#x27;s very easy to lather, I think it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a while and I like it. I love this product in particular because it comes with the pump and I love the size of it!</li>
    <li> I have always liked this conditioner, leaves hair soft, not always soft enough for me (since I have pretty dry hair) but if you have only slightly dried hair then this would be a Godsend for you...plus at its great price, its a great conditioner to have on hand :) plus the smell is GREAT !</li>
    <li> very good ,will buy it gain.</li>
    <li> Why was it discontinued? Will miss it! Please bring it back, my hair needs it! LOL! Excellent product, now will have to buy somewhere else :(</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the pump and the size. Wish it was still available through the subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; conditioner, but nothing special.  I might try it again.  It was just &amp;#34; okay.&amp;#34; I was not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful color!  Pearlized Blue Hawaiian.  Very rich and pretty in the palm of your hand. And the fragrance is luscious, a virgin pina colada.&lt;br /&gt;The brand, Herbal Essences I had trusted for many years to be among the very best of shampoos.  I thought I was going to love this stuff. I bought a liter.  And it appeared to be a very good product after shampooing and drying.  For about eight hours.  And then I noticed something weird.  My hair felt a little heavy, like it had a residue of something left in after rinsing.  But that could not be, because I am a devoted at rinsing and rinse and rinse.  What was that funny, heavy, texture to my hair? It felt a little dirty, only eight hours after washing?  Very odd.  It felt like a slight dusting of talcum powder from the root of my hair to the ends.  Some residue from this particular version of Herbal Essences stays on the hair after radical rinsing and makes the hair feel dusty.  And it makes the hair collect dust, too.  My hair felt dirtier sooner.  Yuk. I don&#x27;t know what kind of chemical is in this stuff (a thing that can only be washed out with other shampoo) but it makes my hair heavier and dusty feeling as if I have been playing in a dust storm for hours.  The second day, 24 hours later, there was just not a funny texture and a filthy feeling in my hair.  Only with this shampoo.  Maybe it is the moisturizer in this concoction.  Not good. It makes my hair feel dirty, not gritty, but as if covered in powder and and certainly not silky, like it usually feels after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Its HUGE. And definitely worth the price. Smells AMAZING and is exactly what you want if you have tried this brand before.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I mean the shampoo I use plays a great roll, but this conditioner goes hand in hand with it nicely. Smells nice and makes hair real soft. I use a different brand shampoo. I have natural African-American hair and it makes my hair so soft and nice</li>
    <li> Great products for dry hair...as well as the shampoo..and the cost was good for the size..............work on curly hair really well</li>
    <li> Ever since pantene changed it&#x27;s formula, I&#x27;ve been looking for a drugstore priced conditioner to use to detangle my natural hair.  I didn&#x27;t want to try an expensive brand because of the unholy amount I use.  I read online that it worked well and purchased a small bottle.  After the first use I went online to find a vat of this stuff.  i don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to get the right amount of slip, it smells great and is well priced.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, convenient and shipped right to my door</li>
    <li> Actually I hate this product. I did not really realize it has the scent of coconut when I bought it. It just smells weird.&lt;br /&gt;I really hate it..... But I like the other scent in the same brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mane and tail conditioner for awhile and decided to try this product because of the popularity it was accruing on Youtube among women with natural (kinky or curly) hair. I think this conditioner is great for people who like to &amp;#34;wash n go&amp;#34;. The consistency of the conditioner is kind of slippery so detangling hair is pretty easy, I am able to use only my finger tips to comb through my curls but everyones hair is different &#x3D;). I like to let this conditioner sit on my hair under a plastic cap while i finish my shower then wash the conditioner about 90% out because I put eco styler in my hair to define my curls. If I leave too much in the conditioner and eco styler make these little white clumps of product and it looks stupid -_-. The best characteristic of this conditioner is hands down the smell! If you like coconut or just the smell of tropical drinks then you will enjoy using this product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am African American with 4c hair and this moisturizes and softens my hair SO well!  I used with it with the tightly curly method to make finger coils/doodles and it worked great.  Days later, my hair still feels moisturized.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair conditioners I have ever used. I love the fragrance. My hair does feel softer after using this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as moisturizered as I&#x27;d like when used alone so I mix it with oils and aloe juice. I gave it 5 stars because you can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> In the natural hair community someone is always raving about one conditioner or another. I tried this product and it is not bad, it smells nice, it is thick and moisturizing but I have tried better for my hair.</li>
    <li> i am so happy I got this in 3 days with standard shipping! The bottle is huge. Smells good. Not too pricey. It&#x27;s not a mind blowing conditioner in my opinion. But it does a good job at making my hair a bit more hydrated ( my hair feels like straw it&#x27;s so dry) so I have nothing negative to say about this! I&#x27;d say try it if you have dry hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge and very cheap!  My wife loves it...it smells great...and no irritation like I&#x27;ve seen on some reviews.  Good.</li>
    <li> I simply have yet to find a conditioner that works as well as this one, ESPECIALLY for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the matching shampoo as suggested, I actually use baby shampoo as it is gentler on my strands, and when paired with this conditioner, I have seen some of the BEST results ever experienced on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my hair very moisturized and super soft. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now and still haven&#x27;t found anything better.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great - very strong and long lasting. I couldn&#x27;t even tell you how many times people come up to me at school and work just to sniff my hair - they can even smell it from a distance.</li>
    <li> Best I have found for use with curls and hard water!  Leaves hair silky smooth. Smells wonderful and lasts forever. Add water and shake once the pump gets all it can... good to the last drop. Works best with the HE Hydration shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and the delivery of it was so fast.hopefully when I run out I can come back and find another bottle with the pump</li>
    <li> item shipped quickly and the quality of it is as expected and i would buy it again deff recomend the subscription</li>
    <li> I use and wrote a review for [[ASIN:B006YQ41VI Burt&#x27;s Bees Super Shiny Shampoo, Mango, 10 Ounce]] and would use the conditioner if I got a lot more for the price. But I don&#x27;t, which is why I tried this at a friend&#x27;s recommendation. The BB&#x27;s shampoo tangles my hair just a little bit, but this detangles it INSTANTLY. And it instantly softens and smoothes, too. It has a flowery smell and rinses out well. I use a generous amount because it&#x27;s so cheap, but you shouldn&#x27;t -need- to use a bunch to get the effects. And if you do, it shouldn&#x27;t matter too much because you get so much for the price. I give it four stars because Carol&#x27;s Daughter and Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful work much better on my hair, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else in this value range that works as well as this stuff does. Would recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a three-in-one picture of my hair in my profile if you want to see it. The last one is right after I rinsed this stuff out. And in case the colors throw you, the back of my hair is black and the frontish is a lighter brown.</li>
    <li> The smell of the conditioner is great and lasts all day long.  It seems like it actually does something to your hair to moisturize it although that may just be a placebo effect.  Overall, one of my favorite hair care products especially for the relatively low price you pay for it.</li>
    <li> This item is less than I pay at Wal-Mart once subscribe and save is factored in.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  My wife and I both like the conditioner and the large bottle is convenient.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many conditioners but nothing is as good as this one for my African American hair. I stopped using it for awhile to try other conditioners again but to no avail this is hands down the best. It makes my hair soft and manageable. As long as they make this conditioner I will keep buying it because it truly does transform my tangled hair into soft curls.</li>
    <li> This is a damn good conditioner , very good performance that is always consistent . Excellent value for money ..</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie and have tried many detanglers. This one works best and is great for the price. The key is that you apply it by section(very liberally), then come back to your first section and detangle. The hair becomes more slick and unified with the conditioner after it has been on for a minute or two. I would not suggest applying and going to detangling the same section immediately, like many YouTube videos demonstrate.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair SO soft and keeps it from tangling. I have thin, color-treated hair, but a lot of it, so it tangles easily. I usually leave conditioner in--washing it out makes my hair impossible to brush. I have tried other conditioners but they feel like water in comparison. This one instantly allows me to put my fingers through my hair and to brush it without feeling like I&#x27;m braking every strand. When I leave this one in and let it dry, it never feels oily or heavy. It stays light and shiny throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what shampoo I use. I am forever faithful to Hello Hydration.</li>
    <li> My go to conditioner for years. Cheap and really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I am a African American with natural hair &amp; this made my hair very soft. I use it as aCo Wash.The bottle is also huge for a good price.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good, is really rich, spreads easily through my thick hair, and moisturizes it really well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t help my fly aways and frizz. I get it way cheaper in store.</li>
    <li> I highlight and blowdry my hair and try to always use a conditioner with moisture for my heat-treated hair.  I like this one because of the smell and texture, and the jumbo bottle is a great value.  Much cheaper than it would be in stores.</li>
    <li> This products is wonderful.  It leaves my hair feeling very soft and detangled. I use it for my co-wash thouhg out the week.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and a great moisturizing conditioner for all hair types. I use to deep condition my hair. I&#x27;m an African American with a 4a/4b curl pattern.</li>
    <li> Smells great, does little really hydrate my hair compared to other conditioners. Very much prefer my S Factor to this one when I can afford it.</li>
