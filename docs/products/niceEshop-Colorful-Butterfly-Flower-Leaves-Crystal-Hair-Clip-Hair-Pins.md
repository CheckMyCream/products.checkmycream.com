<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item is beautiful I gave it as a gift</li>
    <li> Nice piece of jewelry!!</li>
    <li> In order to be fair, I want to state first that I have long, thick, auburn hair. There is a bit of curl to it (very much so when it is short) and my hair will stick out in a hundred different directions on a humid day (thanks, Mom!). So, while this hair stick is absolutely stunning, I had to use other products (and clips) to complete my look. Especially considering that my usual hair routine is to chuck it into a ponytail and braid it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design &amp; Use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair sticks date back many centuries, especially in the Far East, as Japanese women (especially during the Edo period) would put their hair into elaborate up-dos and use hairpins (as well as other hair accouterments) to keep their style from falling out. During that time, hairpins were also a status symbol, with the wealthiest women having them made in various fine metals with elaborate details. In terms of using the hair stick, nothing has really changed in modern times; this pin functions the same as those created centuries ago, although it is infinitely cheaper than one made of pure jade, for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the picture, this hair stick is a bronze/gold color with colored rhinestones, a raised filigree, and a chain that dangles from the head of the piece. If looking at the hairpin from the front (meaning, the side with the rhinestones for decoration), the gems are set to look like leaves circling counter-clockwise on a vine. On the left side there are two large and two medium-sized gems used to create the wings of a butterfly. The tips of the antennae on the butterfly also have rhinestones. The chain actually dangles from a secondary loop in the chain, resulting in two ends. Each end has a different stone; one is a larger teardrop and the other is a small, faceted amethyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this hair pin is what amazes me, especially considering the LOW cost! It is not easy to tell from the vendor&#x27;s photo of the piece, but the detailing on this piece is beautiful. It weighs a bit, coming in at 0.953 oz. (27.03 g.), and feels like it could withstand a lot of abuse. While it is heavier than I expected, it is still lightweight enough to hold a bun in place without pulling itself out of my hair. The only complaint that I have is that you have to be careful with the chain that dangles from the head of the hairpin; it sometimes gets tangled in my hair and I have to gently coax it out for fear of snapping the chain (or pulling out my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said it before, but let me say it again, this hair stick is GORGEOUS! As a comparison, I bought some \\&quot;chopsticks\\&quot; for my hair that were made by Goody; they were some sort of amber-colored polymer, and they cost me MORE than this metal hairpin. The Goody brand had some grooves along the middle parts of each stick in order to keep them in place and not slide out of your hair. While this pin doesn&#x27;t have that, the raised filigree up and down the length of the stick serves the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some may consider this hairpin a bit ostentatious, I consider it a beautiful accessory to any outfit. Whether you want to add a touch of elegance to your hairdo or just like it for its great construction to keep your hair in place, this piece is definitely worth the wait to have in your jewelry box. Combined with other items that the vendor carries, you can have a rhinestone bracelet in the shape of a peacock, two barrettes with a beautiful swirl (with more rhinestones, of course!), and a lovely rhinestone owl necklace to finish off the ensemble. Conversely, if you want to take the more modest approach, just wearing this hair stick for the practical purpose of maintaining your messy up-do makes this piece a must-have. With the free shipping and insanely low cost, as long as you can wait for the item to arrive from China (it took about two weeks), what do you have to lose? Worst case, if it is not to your taste, it would make a beautiful gift to someone you care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are you waiting for? Order a hairpin for yourself and a few for your friends for a great stocking-stuffer or as a birthday present. You will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***PS: I uploaded some of my own pictures of the hairpin in order to better explain the item description that I typed, above.***omeone you care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are you waiting for?

    <li> This a very large, heavy hairpin for thin hair.  I think if my hair was thick  it would work great.  All the crystals were attached firmly and a muted &#x27;fall&#x27; colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend as a gift, its so pretty and I love it~&lt;br /&gt;It came on time also as predicted. I was so excited when it arrived!</li>
    <li> Does just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying my hair is down to my waist. I was expecting it to be a little longer, it won&#x27;t hold my hair on its own because it&#x27;s too short and my hair requires something about the length of a pencil. (Just to clarify, I use all my hair, not the half up half down style shown in the picture) Fortunately, I found a solution to this. I use a hair tie to make a pony tail before using it, it somehow calms my hair and makes the bun easier to hold and it covers the hair tie so it doesn&#x27;t make a difference in the appearance of the bun (well it actually allows me to put hairspray on my hair without damaging the stick so it works out perfectly for me). Other than that, since my hair breaks anything and everything it can, I&#x27;m happy with the quality of the metal. I saw some reviews complained about the top part being too heavy and falling but I haven&#x27;t had this problem at all but it seems like it would happen if the hair isn&#x27;t tight enough, but I make it very tight and leave it for the entire day. I would definitely recommend this product and I have already bought another one in a different style.</li>
    <li> I expected a piece of junk. These are lovely! Beautiful and I plan to purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be waiting a long time for delivery though and one small piece appears to have fallen off. But you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, wasn&#x27;t too excited</li>
    <li> beautiful in an up do</li>
    <li> I like the pattern but this hair stick is not very effective in holding hair by itself.</li>
    <li> This turned out a lot prettier than I expected. It sticks nicely in the hair, I use a hair tie and then it because my hair hates holding onto things. It&#x27;s not so big that it looks silly; it&#x27;s just the right size to show up and be a pretty addition to any look. It arrived safely packaged and on time.</li>
    <li> This is very well made and substantial, but not overly heavy. It has no clip, so it can hold thick hair (which mine is not) or be worn as an ornament for your hair. Again it is very beautiful. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it, it is amazing, super beautiful. It is hard for me to keep on on the hair with out falling, I guess I need more practice :)</li>
    <li> Too heavy. A much lighter product  would have made this a good item. Like the hanging trinket. Will pass it on.</li>
    <li> It is so pretty.  I was surprised at the price.  I ordered it for my granddaughter and she loves it at 7 years old.</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty comb. I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments on the style.  sdf asf sadf asdf ssddf asdf</li>
    <li> My coworkers always tell me how pretty it is. Think I may get some in various colors for them for Christmas. It is kind of cheap, but it&#x27;s held together well and it really does create a sophisticated kind of look. The dangling bits are the touch that pulls it off I think.</li>
    <li> SO VERY STURDY YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES ME. Great for use with thick hair and long hair. (I Have both)</li>
    <li> I love being able to pull the top part of my hair back into a bun and hold it in place all day with this beautiful  hair stick.  It&#x27;s so much nicer than using a clip that slips out of my hair or won&#x27;t clip, because my hair is too thick.  If you don&#x27;t know how to use a hair stick, there are videos on You Tube that teach you how to use one.  It is so easy.  I&#x27;m surprised more people don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Picture exactly as shown, if not more beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The gems look gorgeous and the hairpiece looks very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal. However, ships very late.</li>
    <li> My thingy -momabi for my hair is beautiful and Amason is Awsome looks great on me or my daughter&lt;br /&gt;Thank u guys</li>
    <li> a little too much for everyday wear.  This would be pretty if you were wearing a mandarin collar dress or shirt.  It definitely has that oriental look to it.</li>
    <li> Very nice pin, good finishing, well packaged &amp;  a great product&lt;br /&gt;Goes very well with Indian ethnic oufits &amp; spring styles&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It&#x27;s cheap and pretty, so I wasn&#x27;t one hundred percent sure what I would receive. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it is in person. A jewel or two is slightly off center but that&#x27;s fine with me! :)</li>
    <li> I loved it! It&#x27;s a substantial piece that looks great on my hair. It&#x27;s so well worth the price, thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is so unbelievable. The photo doesn&#x27;t get it the justice it deserves. This is such a beautiful piece and it is very well made. I haven&#x27;t seen this type of hair pin before, but I LOVE IT. I would recommend this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but the end design is very heavy, I find that the weight makes it uncomfortable to use.  I have thick hair, so it stays in, but it is too heavy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this pin. Very good for my long-long hair. And it looks very rich. I can use it almost with each dress.</li>
    <li> Just received today and it is beautiful.  I have very thick hair, and I was impressed by the strength of the product.  So pleased with the product that I&#x27;m going to check and see what else this seller offers.  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> When this item came in I was thrilled!  I have long hair and I wanted to test out the stick.  It wouldn&#x27;t go all they way through my bun.  The stick itself is about 1 inch too short for me.  Its beautiful though.</li>
    <li> It took a few weeks to arrive, but for the cost, well worth the wait!  It&#x27;s a lovely piece and receive many compliments on it!  In fact, I&#x27;d even buy one as a gift! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> FOR PRICE IS AWESOME--PRETTY 4 CASUAL TO GO WITH JEAN SKIRT OR-- PANTS-- WHATEVER U LIKE  LOADS OF COMPLIMENTS-+-WHERE&#x27;D U GET THAT!!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely unacceptable. First it took over a month to receive, and was still 5 days late. And when I opened the package there was black powder that came out of it which had a horrible smell. And the piece is chipped with stones missing and does not look anything like what I ordered. I could care less about the refund $2.50 but come on.&lt;br /&gt;Then when I try to return amazon tells me that&#x27;s they don&#x27;t do return inflammable products! What does that mean???</li>
    <li> It is definitely designed for someone right-handed. The stick part of it is a little rough I think it should be smoother for your hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so easy to use and holds its place. I always get compliments on it at work. Very strong material</li>
    <li> This hair comb works well in my fine hair.  I get many compliments from it.  Easy to use and stays in well.</li>
    <li> It has a very unique design and very feminine. All the stones are as it is in picture. Very cute.</li>
    <li> This is not a flimsy hairpin. It is well made and has scoring on the shaft so that it stays in your hair well.</li>
    <li> The stem has engravings all the way down it. Definitely looks worth much more than I paid. Was even better than pictured! I have gotten sooo many compliments on this. Love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet so as far as durability I can&#x27;t say but as far as the piece itself for looks I thought it was cute as can be and would make a great hair pin. I don&#x27;t wear my hair up much until summer months so that is why I haven&#x27;t use it yet. I think for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I really like this for my hair. It&#x27;s very pretty and seems to be made well. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I have very long hair and I like to wear it different ways, this is just 1 more way that I can dress my hair up. I don&#x27;t see any cons unless you don&#x27;t know how to use it and that would be your own fault.</li>
    <li> This clip is so cute..and it&#x27;s strong not plastic..well worth every penny..and well worth the wait..a very nice well made piece of clip..cute to wear when ever where ever..a nice piece of jewelry for your hair..the seller did a good job to make sure that it was well packaged, I&#x27;m a happy buyer.</li>
    <li> I loved this! I can whip my girls hair in a bun in less then one minute with this and they look fabulous. Just put he hair in a pony tail twist and stick. sadly one of my girls was using this and took it out for dance and it was lost. I just ordered another to replace it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and different looking, unlike store quality hair clips that cost twice as much as this clip and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> These are just beautiful.  I&#x27;ve ordered the whole collection and linned them in a tin box.  they are beautiful.  I&#x27;ve also given a few as gifts.  Thank you for such beautiful hair pins.  My sister also use them as pins for scarfs and shalls.  Just lovely.</li>
    <li> The shipping took about a month and a half, but when I got the hair pin it was in good condition (no jewels falling off, not broken or snapped). The end with the jewels is very heavy and keeps falling out of my hair, but for such a cheap price complaining about little things like that sounds petty. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> My assistant loved it.  I gave it to her as a gift for graduation.  She wears it daily and loves it</li>
    <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
    <li> looks great in my hair~ package was great~ just what I wanted ~ would order again if I see something else</li>
    <li> I like this  though I find it hard to get my hair to stay up in it. Not the item probably the user!! Well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this hair tool would be very Lovely to place in my hair if it ever shows up in the mail .... I have been waite&#x27;n for over a mounth now . Hope&#x27;n they show soon ! :/</li>
    <li> This item took a while to get here but its worth it , very nicely made and looks really fancy ,love the colors and details.</li>
    <li> Good looks good for the hair, and was deliver undamaged and was happy</li>
    <li> brought for my grand dauther. She was so inpressed by it. She told me I should not have spent so much money on her. ( If she only knew)</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and the quality really outshines the price I paid. I am extremely happy with this purchase. Just be prepared to wait at least 3-4weeks for arrival. Comes from China.</li>
    <li> a bit heavy but it was what I expected. DIdn&#x27;t absolutely love it because of its weight and length. I wish it would be longer than it is.</li>
    <li> I love this piece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds my thick hair wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the danglies hold up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the colors are brilliant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Very cute for the price. The dangles sometimes bother me if I wear it when being very active though. But its cute.</li>
    <li> Finally it arrived. It works as it says and for the price, it&#x27;s worth the long waiting. Better order more at once so after so many days, you get more than 1 little item.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is so beautiful, elegant and well done! It looks expensive and classy! Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> I love this piece and always get compliments on it.  It is also unique and different from what I am used to wearing and have fin discovering different ways to wear it.</li>
    <li> My product arrived in pieces. And when I opened up the package to pull it out, more pieces fell off. VERY cheaply made.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very pretty and the price was quite good.  However, one piece (a cut glass jewel in the butterfly&#x27;s wing) felt out the first time this was worn.  Fortunately I found the piece and was able to glue it back on.</li>
    <li> this came pretty quick (considering how far it had to travel), high quality brass.  My only complaint is that the little chain that dangles gets caught in your hair and pulls it.  Other than that, works nicely</li>
    <li> Use it today, love it, made wonderfully, looks good very beautifully, planning on ordering more like this and others like it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them. Very easy to use and add so much style to your hair. Getting 2 of them. is great. The part that dangles off the hair clip should have been made one right and one left.</li>
    <li> I never recived this item very disapointed will never order again. had this gift in mind for a FRIEND for Christmas</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this is that I only purchased one.  Two would look so good that I&#x27;m coming back for another....buy two, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> it feels very strong and looks even more elegant in person.</li>
    <li> I wear this often, it is nice and heavy and sturdily constructed and I get lots of compliments.  This was a great buy.</li>
    <li> really makes a boring up style come to life !!!!! recommend product!&lt;br /&gt;love it its not thin and cheap looking actually looks like I spent some real cash on it !&lt;br /&gt;always getting compliments ! I work where my hair must b up at all times ugh! so anyways long story short this&lt;br /&gt;has fixed the issue w boring hair</li>
    <li> I love wearing hair pin.  This is such a beautiful hair pin. I love it.  Great product, great price, have no complain about anything.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself while ordering Christmas presents on Amazon. I knew the shipping would take longer and I didn&#x27;t mind waiting. I received it last week and it really is a beautiful piece. I have very long hair that I knot up in a bun at work. This adds a touch of class to my old lady hairdo!</li>
    <li> I received many compliments on this.  Looks much nicer than I expected.  I have fine hair and had trouble getting this to hold my hair/stay in, but I finally used spin pins to keep my bun in place and then used this as decoration.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Look just like the pic I buying more . And it&#x27;s surprising what good quality it is thank you !!</li>
    <li> i bought it coz it&#x27;s cute and very attractive,.it&#x27;s kinda like heavyl!! quality perfect..one of a kind..and i love it!</li>
    <li> This is such a great hair accessory for someone with long hair who enjoys adding a little bling to their look.  LONG shipping time if you&#x27;re in the states, but so beautiful.  Great price and worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Very well made. It&#x27;s not flimsy. I wear it often and always get compliments on it. I secure my hair first and then put the stick through.</li>
    <li> Bought mine from Princess&#x27; Dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product to those in favor of hair pins/sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The jewels look beautiful on the bronze-colored metal.&lt;br /&gt;Love the two dangling chains.&lt;br /&gt;The product is sturdy. I dropped it multiple times and everything is still intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;When I received this product, the metal stick looks rusted.&lt;br /&gt;The pin is only as long as my hand. Therefore, if you have a lot of hair (like I do), I recommend you wear the pin like in the picture or some other style that the pin can handle. If you have long hair, this pin might hold it up.&lt;br /&gt;Jewel colors differ from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking through several reviews, I thought this hair pin would be as gorgeous as those reviews had described.&lt;br /&gt;But in reality, it looks pretty ordinary and can be used for daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck!</li>
    <li> I like this hair clips hairpin. But you will look like Chinese when you wear it. But I expect I can take out some stones</li>
    <li> This head piece is so beautiful and very classy. The stones are brilliant, I have no idea how genuine they are but they seem pretty sturdy and have enough shine to them. I do not find the piece extremely heavy: it does hold up well in my African tightly curled hair which varies in texture and curl pattern depending on my hair regimen at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this piece to have all these qualities and still be inexpensive is a deal right there, so go ahead people and purchase for loved ones, friends and for yourself.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of cheap jewelry and hair things on amazon, and this was surprisingly good quality! It looks lovely and I always get compliments!!</li>
    <li> This hair pin is absolutely gorgeous and very well made. It has a pretty brass finish with detailed craftsmanship. Te color of the jewels are very vibrant. and are well secured to the pin. The whole pin is about 6.4 inches long by about 2 inches wide. The part that goes in your hair is about 4.5 inches long. This pin is not be good for super long or very thick hair unless it is secured in a hair tie.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! This was given as a gift to my daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and I can put my hair in a quick bun at work without leaving any creases. The multi-colored on really does match all! :-)</li>
    <li> Very unique very pretty. The picture online doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Its a very pretty piece to have.Many compliments when its wore.</li>
    <li> Nice to finally find a site that sells very pretty affordable hair pins.  I love adding a little decoration to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
    <li> Very Beautiful, feels solid and it&#x27;s exactly the same as they say. No crystals missing and nothing loose, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. If you want something to hold your hair up and decorate it to look beautiful this is it. It matches with everything so that&#x27;s a plus as well.</li>
    <li> I love this it was beautiful....Delivered early...looked great and was very sturdy...the picture did not do it justice... can&#x27;t wait to wear it out</li>
    <li> They are super pretty but if you have thin or fine hair or if you want them for a child, know that they are way too heavy to stay in the hair. My friend with think long hair looks beautiful in it.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does come on the slow boat, but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry and these just work really well in my hair.  Very sturdy and stays in all day.</li>
    <li> Its was really pretty but for heavy and long hair not for short tho.</li>
    <li> The Fashion Butterfly jewelry Simply beautiful  Picture does not do it justice  Absolutely lovely  Will make a great Christmas present  Delighted here</li>
    <li> Very pretty; however, you really need to have very thick hair....need to advertise for thick hair only but very pretty.</li>
    <li> Once again I received beautiful hair pieces!! These are really nice quality. Beautiful colors that sparkle in the sun/light. My 6 year old daughter wears them to school often. All the rhinestones are still intact and you can imagine the wear and tear a 6year old can do. They stay in place all day (except for the actual hair stick, she hasn&#x27;t worn that one yet.) They are a bit on the heavy side (again except the actual hair stick, its a bit lighter) and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; help hold them in place. Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of these items. Definitely worth the price, I will be buying more to add to our collection!</li>
    <li> It felt like it took forever to get here, but once it did I didn&#x27;t even care anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautiful!! I was so impressed that I put my hair in a bun and started wearing it right away.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This may or may not hold your hair in a bun. I chose to play it safe and secure my hair with twist pins and then place the pin where I wanted. I don&#x27;t use it to hold my hair in a bun, but rather for decoration only.&lt;br /&gt;The detailing is lovely and it has some weight to it which is great since I have really thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love! I want another one! :)</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today after waiting almost one month, and after seeing the quality of the item it was worth it. :)&lt;br /&gt;The size, quality of the stones and how the item is completely finished even on the back amazed me for the tiny price that I paid, the colors are also perfect for fall.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as a stocking stuffer ... wow looks better in person, looks like something you would buy for more than 5 times the price elsewhere</li>
    <li> This hair clip is MUCH nicer than I expected. My daughter loved it and took this one so I have to order me another one. Buy you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful!!! I LOVED it!!</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife and she was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Its ok but low quality.  Will just last u for one use.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compliments on this hair feature. I constantly wear my hair up and in a bun so this is the perfect, pretty fix that I enjoy wearing. It compliments any hair color.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent i love it, its easy n faster to use ... With reasonable price. I would prefer to use it for daily use</li>
    <li> The multicolored butterfly hair stick works well for a variety of outfits. Best to put in once your hair is already put up with either bobby pins or (my favorite) spin pins.</li>
    <li> I ordered it to wear to a wedding, but it took 6 weeks to arrive. The couple were back from their honeymoon, before I had a chance to wear it!!!  The stick is pretty. A little off balanced, so you have to be careful how you insert it into your hair, so it doesn&#x27;t walk itself back out as you walk. I have [thin to medium] thickness of hair. I wear it just past my shoulders. I twist and lift my hair into a french roll, and insert the stick at an angle [2 o&#x27;clock to 7 o&#x27;clock], and it looks great, and holds my hair well.</li>
    <li> It is pretty (other people says that), but its pin is not smooth and therefore is not easy to weave through hair.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely beautiful, but I dont have enough hair for it anymore. I gave it to a friend and she loves it. The price was perfect</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife who is Native American.  It looks great and was better than expected for the cost.</li>
    <li> I love this cute accessory! Great with my ethnic patterned tunics!</li>
    <li> Love it beautiful the best</li>
    <li> This is a very nice piece of hair jewelry. Heavy and seemingly well made. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for! Though it looks pretty at a first glance, - when you look closer and hold it in your hand, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s made cheap. The stones aren&#x27;t sitting too well, and the metal looks thick and not quite smooth. Hard to describe, but it looks like something you find at a Dollar Stores.</li>
    <li> its beautiful and of good quality i really love this product its reat for chic buns, a great piece for the collection</li>
    <li> This is a stunning hair ornament!  It&#x27;s not too blingy, and the colors of the stones should look good on any hair color.  I&#x27;m too chicken to depend on it to hold all my hair (there&#x27;s a lot of it), but it&#x27;s gorgeous stabbed through a chignon or a messy bun.  It has enough texture that it won&#x27;t fall out.  I love the dangly pieces.  So elegant</li>
    <li> And it seems solidly made.  It&#x27;s great for the price. I would definitely recommend it for someone who wanted something cute and stylish.  and it holds up my very thick bra strap length hair okay.</li>
    <li> Honestly the product is nice.  But a part of the dangling broke off.  This was a . Christmas gift.So I was embarrassed to find out it had broken. They&#x27;re sending it back to me. Then I&#x27;ll return to you.</li>
    <li> The hair pin is beautiful and classy looking. Not cheap looking. Especially for the low price I paid. The green clip has pretty peridot looking crystals.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this hair clip.  Vibrant colors, and looks very durable.  I&#x27;m going to have to order more, because my girlfriend stole this one!</li>
    <li> Very pretty, looks great with my long, red hair.  Secures quick up-dos easily with minimal fuss.  Solid yet lightweight design.  A long hair necessity !!!</li>
    <li> I honestly feel that this product is worth the long wait! It&#x27;s beautiful and is the perfect size! I wish I had ordered more!</li>
    <li> I wanted this by Christmas, I was told by the vendor it could not make it. I was glad they were frank. This is a great hair stick, really pretty. Not as gaudy as one would think from the picture and it was larger than I expected for the price. It took awhile to get here but my wife loves it (she wears it too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing she seems bothered by is that the dangle-ly bit taps her head. I&#x27;m going to shorten it. This may not be a concern if your hair is thicker than hers or if you have a different head size however. It&#x27;s really pretty, well glazed and solid. I would buy it again given the chance.</li>
    <li> took forever to get it, but it is so pretty. I have long hair but wear it up most of the summer. (due to heat) and this is a great touch to finish off a bun.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality and looks of both hair pins.&lt;br /&gt;Very vivid colors. Strong and sturdy for  the thickest hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and good quality. Looks like it&#x27;ll last a long time. But I think it should be a little longer. My hair is very thick and long and it doesn&#x27;t hold everything..</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair pin &amp; a fantastic price.  It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item is prettier then in the picture.  Love how it looks in my hair, even my husband noticed how nice it looks.  Glas I bought two of them!</li>
    <li> This hair stick is very pretty and the stick portion is sturdy enough to hold up my mid-back length hair.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried using this in my hair with different styles and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I think it&#x27;s made just as you&#x27;d expect for the price. My other issue is it causes tangles and pulls my hair when the beads that dangle from it, touch the rest of my hair. I think the chain is the problem?  If you want to try it, be aware!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this over a year and I only wore it twice...It&#x27;s way to heavy. Other than that, It&#x27;s a really cute hair piece.</li>
    <li> This clip is pretty but doesn&#x27;t work well for my medium fine hair - slips out too easily.  I find I have to use a rubber band first, then wrap my hair around and spear through catching the rubber band or it will not stay in my hair.  But this defeats the purpose of a looser, casual look.</li>
    <li> all my friends like it and they want to have one too it is very beautiful, it is a good for a  gift</li>
    <li> I wear the hair pin either by itself or through a clip. I have thick hair, and this pin is big enough to hold well.</li>
    <li> The piece that goes through your hair is rough, but after it is through your hair it is pretty.</li>
    <li> The hairpin has very bright colors and  is good quality. I really love it. it is really good value given this price .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wear this. I have to pick my outfit so I can coordinate. Love the sophistication of this piece.</li>
    <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
    <li> This is like hair jewelry. Really exquisite and fashionable. Really brings out your hair whether its curly or straight. I love wearing it when i flat iron my hair but even when i wear my hair in its natural state :curly; this piece if hair jewel is a show stopper.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair accessory. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap like others. The gems are glued on very well.&lt;br /&gt;The price seems reasonable. It did take about a month before I received it. It was shipped from China, but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> when i received the hair clips it was so pretty and many people like it. Some other people asking me where did you get that i&#x27;m telling that i bought in amazon. i really like it...! ((:</li>
    <li> Gave it to my grandma because she has super long hair. It looks stunning. She didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how little it cost. Very pretty but probably for long hair only or medium hair with half up style.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! It&#x27;s the perfect accent to my red hair, and I always get compliments on it. Perfect to stick through a braid to make a bun no bobby pins required.</li>
    <li> This is just a simple cute piece. It is what I expected. The price was right for this piece. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this to style my hair, but it seems very well made. Sold for a decent price and would order again. However, be prepared to wait a couple weeks before it&#x27;s delivered as it will take at least that long,</li>
    <li> Would have been nice to know that these items were coming from another country....they were supposed to be &amp;#34;Stocking Stuffers&amp;#34; Also would have been nice to know that pretty much everything I ordered were seperate vendors....Sorry, I&#x27;m pretty new to the on-line order thing !</li>
    <li> I love it, so glad I saw it. Very chic with my hair up. I also wear it when my hair is in a ponytail. have worn it thru a knitted hat. Summer time thru straw hat to keep it anchored like an old fashioned hat-pin. ThankU&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> Took a little while to get here but it was worth the wait. It&#x27;s very pretty and holds my hair up very well!</li>
    <li> This actually looks pretty nice. I thought it would be something crappy since it was shipping all the way from China, but it is built pretty strong. The colors are so beautiful.</li>
    <li> I bought this costume hair pin jewelry as a gift. It is very affordable and my neice said it is exactly what she wanted for her long hair.</li>
    <li> OMG! This looks like a high quality piece! I bought it as a gift for my sister and when I opened the package I almost kept it for myself! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did she! It stays in her hair well and she gets so many compliments!</li>
    <li> If you want to dress up your bun or up do this will do the trick. Finally hair jewlery for long hair!</li>
    <li> This lovely hair pen looks beautiful and is much easier on the hair than a scrunchy or band. It adds a little someting extra as well</li>
    <li> Impressed with the quality and is very pretty.  Even the stick portion is embossed.  Would make a beautiful gift.</li>
    <li> Very good! Thank you!)</li>
    <li> This right here is a little gem! It looks just like the image provided. It came earlier than the expected delivery date.It is a very lovely hair piece! Oooo! I just cannot wait to try it on for a formal event! It is definitely an eye catcher and worth the price! I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered this.</li>
    <li> Very nice and a great price.  The metal is pretty sturdy, but a few stones fell out very shortly after I got it so I no longer wear it.  It is not high quality, but I think you would expect that from the price.  Very pretty when it is intact!</li>
    <li> beautiful one but for long hair</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother as she loves turquoise. This was slightly heavy (good sign- shows it isn&#x27;t cheap!) and it did stay in her thin hair easily and did not fall out.</li>
    <li> Loved it just a little something to make your hair look just right and elegant. Holds the hair just right.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, but a little bit heavy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it looks like in the picture</li>
    <li> I love my hairpin thank you again</li>
    <li> Good if you have thick hair.  It&#x27;s lovely, but too heavy for my abundant but medium-fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting on it to come and I have about a week left until the expected date!! I am very excited it looks so pretty and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat! &lt;3</li>
