<ol>
      <li>The smell is great and it works as advertised!</li>
      <li>but it smells soooo good!</li>
      <li>it was a win win win.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo.  </li>
      <li>For a two pack it was a great price.</li>
      <li>this is great and when I started using it my husband even noticed and liked the smell of my hair.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo with nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Scent is good and efficacy is also good！</li>
      <li>I liked it, he liked it, and a great price.</li>
      <li>When I was growing up, the woman who used to cut my hair would use this delicious fresh apple shampoo on my hair.</li>
      <li>this is definitely a great product it smells fantastic</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It has a cream texture rather than a gel like many shampoos,  One of my favorite shampoos.</li>
      <li>My hair would smell so lovely for hours.</li>
      <li>It was my favorite part of the hair cut.</li>
      <li>And the added benefit of the amazing smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>But now, no matter how many times I wash it, I can&#x27;t get this sticky oil out of my hair.</li>
      <li>Not a miracle cure, but better.</li>
      <li>love head and shoulders.  </li>
      <li>Giving it 4 stars for rinsing clean, giving my hair nice body, helping with dandruff issues.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, burns in your eyes and works really well!!</li>
      <li>Smells great, works great, not too expensive.</li>
      <li>Great for dandruff and dry scalp, but be warned, it will strip/oxidize your haircolor/highlights.</li>
      <li>Pretty much the perfect shampoo, actually.</li>
      <li>I purchased this via Amazon and although it had a nice &amp;#34;green apple&amp;#34; scent inside the bottle, by the time I&#x27;m out of the shower the scent is completely gone.</li>
      <li>and it was a full bottle</li>
      <li>This product has left my hair incredibly oily and gross, I would give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily scalp and this shampoo makes my hair feel clean without adding grease.  </li>
      <li>In the future, I should remind myself that bulk items really aren&#x27;t in my best interest due to my disability.</li>
      <li>I love the green apple scent which is very fresh and clean smelling without being at all overpowering.  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft, manageable, and dandruff free.</li>
      <li>When you finish shampooing only a light fragrance is left on your hair most of the scent rinses out.  </li>
      <li>I love it even after I shower and blow dry my hair</li>
      <li>About a year ago I was told by my doctor that I had dandruff, when I came in because I was loosing large amounts of hair.  </li>
      <li>and it is really affordable</li>
      <li>I felt as though it wasn&#x27;t really cleansing my hair.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, healthy hair.</li>
      <li>As expected except the price was far better that the store.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s not a subtle oil; it feels like I put a bunch of oil, hairspray, and mousse in my hair.</li>
      <li>I got the green apple flavor that I like and its leaves the hair with a clean and fresh aroma.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m disabled and showering takes longer for me than it does for most</li>
      <li>I emailed the company directly to tell them what it did to my hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is not  much like fresh apples.</li>
      <li>and I noticed my hair not feeling clean afterwards but feeling heavy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never liked using dandruff shampoos because typically they dont smell good,</li>
      <li>I have been cursed with dry scalp and oily hair and have mild to moderate dandruff, especially in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Now after this last wash my hair looks like I rubbed a stick of butter right down the part.</li>
      <li>As for dandruff treatment, I found them to be less than stellar</li>
      <li>It is not horrible, especially if you are nostalgic for green apple candy, but if you are looking for fresh and natural, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>but I also use the  same brand and scent of conditioner and generally leave that on my hair until I&#x27;m about to get out, so I was a bit flummoxed.</li>
      <li>It is a ver creamy substance and I was feeling ready for a wash less than a day later.</li>

<li> It leaves my hair greasy yet dry and does not smell like the store product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the last year and it works great with my hair, yet this shampoo and conditioner is awful.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use any extra product in my hair - just a little shampoo sometimes.</li>

<li> I can still smell the green apple sent.</li>
<li> Head &amp; Shoulders Green Apple Dandruff Shampoo&lt;</li>
<li> I bought this garbage and have used it for the past week</li>
<li> At least for me.</li>
<li> My complaint though</li>
<li> No more flakes for me!</li>
<li> It reminds me of green apple candy - artificial.</li>
<li> DOes not smell like the green apple flavor candy that can be unappetizing.</li>
<li> I saw this and felt a bit nostalgic, so I purchased.</li>
<li> Like I said, this may just be myself, but it is still very disappointing.</li>
<li> I used this product for a week and it made the crown of my head/hair disgustingly oily.</li>
<li> I never write Amazon reviews but this product is so horrible</li>

    <li> Great shampoo.  My hair is soft, manageable, and dandruff free.</li>
    <li> Scent is good and efficacy is also good！</li>
    <li> The smell is great and it works as advertised! No dandruff!</li>
    <li> I still like this Shampoo. The smell, the texture, etc. However, it is NOT 100% guaranteed for flake-free. I used this multiple times, and still had Dandruff. And the fact it says &amp;#34;100% guarantee&amp;#34; is quite a lie. At least for me. It was pretty disappointing, for Head and Shoulders to sell such an un-useful product. Like I said, this may just be myself, but it is still very disappointing. 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, not too expensive. Pretty much the perfect shampoo, actually.</li>
    <li> About a year ago I was told by my doctor that I had dandruff, when I came in because I was loosing large amounts of hair.  I decided to try Head and Shoulders because it has been around such a long time I figured it must work.  I love the green apple scent which is very fresh and clean smelling without being at all overpowering.  When you finish shampooing only a light fragrance is left on your hair most of the scent rinses out.  I have a very oily scalp and this shampoo makes my hair feel clean without adding grease.  It has a cream texture rather than a gel like many shampoos,  One of my favorite shampoos.</li>
    <li> This product has left my hair incredibly oily and gross, I would give it 0 stars if I could. It looks like I have not bathed in weeks! I bought this garbage and have used it for the past week and I noticed my hair not feeling clean afterwards but feeling heavy. Now after this last wash my hair looks like I rubbed a stick of butter right down the part. I have read in several reviews that people are having trouble removing the oily feeling so I could not be more disappointed. Suave gets 5 stars compared to this. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I never write Amazon reviews but this product is so horrible I had to warn future purchasers. I used this product for a week and it made the crown of my head/hair disgustingly oily. I have thin, fine, healthy hair. But now, no matter how many times I wash it, I can&#x27;t get this sticky oil out of my hair. And it&#x27;s not a subtle oil; it feels like I put a bunch of oil, hairspray, and mousse in my hair. It&#x27;s so gross. I emailed the company directly to tell them what it did to my hair. If someone knows how to get rid of this oiliness, please let me know!!</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Green Apple Dandruff Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 2 pack. It smells nice, burns in your eyes and works really well!! No more flakes for me!</li>
    <li> As expected except the price was far better that the store.</li>
    <li> When I was growing up, the woman who used to cut my hair would use this delicious fresh apple shampoo on my hair. It was my favorite part of the hair cut.

I have been cursed with dry scalp and oily hair and have mild to moderate dandruff, especially in the winter months. I don&#x27;t use any extra product in my hair - just a little shampoo sometimes.

Giving it 4 stars for rinsing clean, giving my hair nice body, helping with dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> Great for dandruff and dry scalp, but be warned, it will strip/oxidize your haircolor/highlights. I had to stop using it and switched to a color-safe (sulfate-free) shampoo by Pureology.</li>
    <li> I purchased this via Amazon and although it had a nice &amp;#34;green apple&amp;#34; scent inside the bottle, by the time I&#x27;m out of the shower the scent is completely gone. I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m disabled and showering takes longer for me than it does for most but I also use the  same brand and scent of conditioner and generally leave that on my hair until I&#x27;m about to get out, so I was a bit flummoxed. I did notice that the expiration date on my products was 2013. As for dandruff treatment, I found them to be less than stellar but I suspect that may be due to the expiration date as well. In the future, I should remind myself that bulk items really aren&#x27;t in my best interest due to my disability.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Shampoo for about a year now and I love it. I&#x27;ve never liked using dandruff shampoos because typically they dont smell good, well this stuff not only helps with dandruff but it smells soooo good! I love it even after I shower and blow dry my hair I can still smell the green apple sent.</li>
    <li> I struggled with how to rate this shampoo. I have psoriasis and using this daily helped to a point I was no longer using tar shampoo. And the added benefit of the amazing smell is fantastic. My complaint though (and this may be a personal preference) I felt as though it wasn&#x27;t really cleansing my hair. It is a ver creamy substance and I was feeling ready for a wash less than a day later.</li>
    <li> A staple in my shower.</li>
    <li> love head and shoulders.  delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the last year and it works great with my hair, yet this shampoo and conditioner is awful. It leaves my hair greasy yet dry and does not smell like the store product.</li>
    <li> For a two pack it was a great price. I got the green apple flavor that I like and its leaves the hair with a clean and fresh aroma.  DOes not smell like the green apple flavor candy that can be unappetizing. this is great and when I started using it my husband even noticed and liked the smell of my hair. it was a win win win. I liked it, he liked it, and a great price.</li>
    <li> this is definitely a great product it smells fantastic and it is really affordable and it was a full bottle</li>
    <li> Great shampoo with nice fragrance.</li>
