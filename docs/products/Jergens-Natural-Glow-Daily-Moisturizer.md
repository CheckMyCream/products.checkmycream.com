      <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>This lotion does not make the skin look orange or streaky and it conditions nicely .</li>
      <li>Just a nice tan color.  </li>
      <li>Still using the face lotion version till I find something better</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Love the color too, doesn&#x27;t turn me orange.  </li>
      <li>This is the best daily moisturizer/tanning product I have purchased.</li>
      <li>I love having the convenient pump on this bottle.  </li>
      <li>Glow it gives is ok color</li>
      <li>I would recommend using the Jergens natural glow face moisturizer along with it, so you get that beautiful glow from head to toe.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to see that it now comes with a pump!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nothing like some of the strong</li>
      <li>The color is perfect, not too dark but just gives a sun kissed glow.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use this and enjoy my tan glow.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, helps your tan last longer</li>
      <li>I wish it was available in Europe.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this sunless tanner.</li>
      <li>It gives a really natural tanning look and it is good for mantaining your selftanner</li>
      <li>Meanwhile ur &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Moms has a moist pretty tan!!</li>
      <li>I love this new size adn would really love if Jergens would offer 3 days to glow in this size also.</li>
      <li>It gives a beautiful tan look, without looking orange or being to dark.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it is so soft and moisturising plus so easy to use.</li>
      <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but my only reason is that it smells fine going on, but after a while for some reason... and this is just my opinion, it kind of smells like corn chips...</li>
      <li>but it goes away quickly</li>
      <li>It still has a mild tanning smell to it</li>
      <li>Again, I could live with it if I was in love.  </li>
      <li>I mean it smells really really good!</li>
      <li>I had to undo the entire top each time to use.</li>
      <li>and then when I want more color in the summer I use Jergen&#x27;s &#x27;3 Days to Glow&#x27; twice a week for an even darker tan, still using this one daily.  </li>
      <li>I have tried lots of different self tanners and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you a nice tone that much and makes my skin dry</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to maintain a consistent tan all year long.</li>
      <li>I also find the color is true to a natural tan.</li>
      <li>Love the new pump dispenser...use this after my shower with easy access compared to trying to hold the old tube dispenser in wet hands.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My wife feels this is the best artificial tan cream she has found.</li>
      <li>It really dries my skin out.</li>
      <li>Really fast shipping to Spain.</li>
      <li>A good scrubbing becomes necessary to even out which takes down the color, of course.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on the pricey ones thinking that means a better product NO UR PAYING FOR HYPE ALONE.</li>
      <li>It smells way less than the odor that comes from the other self-tanners, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the only thing i really use in the summer.</li>
      <li>I having been using Jergens Natural Glow for years and never had this problem.  </li>
      <li>Also the tan isn&#x27;t very even and slightly orange.</li>
      <li>If I get a little streaking from putting it on uneven, it is easy to cover up the next day.  </li>

<li> it&#x27;s name brands only false pride baby girl!!</li>
<li> All and all, not impressed.  </li>
<li> My daughter won&#x27;t use anything but Fake Bake and sorry</li>
<li> Vicious cycle.  </li>

    <li> Amazing stuff.  Bronzes your skin beautifully!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years or so. It&#x27;s not technically a self-tanner but it&#x27;s the only thing i really use in the summer. The color is perfect, not too dark but just gives a sun kissed glow.  I love this new size adn would really love if Jergens would offer 3 days to glow in this size also.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to. I don&#x27;t use every day as my legs start looking a bit orange but they aren&#x27;t pasty white either. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I may have a watered down bottle.  Lotion does nothing, no color change at all.  I having been using Jergens Natural Glow for years and never had this problem.  Never buy this again online.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that it colors your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m like neon pale.  Glow it gives is ok color but blotchiness starts after 3-4 applications.  A good scrubbing becomes necessary to even out which takes down the color, of course.  Vicious cycle.  Also I went through half of the bottle in a week, applying 1-2 times daily.  Wouldn&#x27;t mind if I loved it.  Smell is perfumey, and DHA smell follows.  Again, I could live with it if I was in love.  Lotion is on the thick side which makes applying laborious at times.  All and all, not impressed.  Still using the face lotion version till I find something better but I think it might be causing me to breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search for Amir Touch of Tan on here...cheaper and 100x better in every way!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, helps your tan last longer</li>

    <li> The best color ease of use and how can u beat great moisturing and tan!! Don&#x27;t forget price!! Win win win. Don&#x27;t waste money on the pricey ones thinking that means a better product NO UR PAYING FOR HYPE ALONE. My daughter won&#x27;t use anything but Fake Bake and sorry but it is exactly that FAKE LOOK. Of course for her it&#x27;s name brands only false pride baby girl!! Meanwhile ur &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Moms has a moist pretty tan!! Cie&#x27; Le Vie...oh and cash left over for....spa day  yea!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this sunless tanner. For one thing it smells amazing- I mean it smells really really good! I also find the color is true to a natural tan. Not orange-y at all. I would definitely recommend this sunless tanner.</li>
    <li> I love the product but was disappointed the pump didn&#x27;t work.  I had to undo the entire top each time to use.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It gives a beautiful tan look, without looking orange or being to dark.

    <li> Really fast shipping to Spain. It gives a really natural tanning look and it is good for mantaining your selftanner</li>
    <li> It smells way less than the odor that comes from the other self-tanners, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  But I have very fair skin and&lt;br /&gt;no one even noticed I had a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; at all.  Worse, I broke out in red blotches from it....I must be allergic.</li>
    <li> My wife feels this is the best artificial tan cream she has found.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave orange streaks and also moisturizers. Always getting compliments on my tan.</li>
    <li> This is the best daily moisturizer/tanning product I have purchased. I&#x27;m able to maintain a consistent tan all year long.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years, and I have always loved it. If you don&#x27;t apply it evenly, it will of course end up uneven. I was really excited to see that it now comes with a pump! I have a warmer skin tone so I always use the darker color or else it would never look like I had a tan.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. Im addicted to getting rid of the pale pasty look of my skin during the winter.</li>
    <li> In a week my skin is no longer snow white. I have a nice healthy glow!</li>
    <li> It really dries my skin out. Also the tan isn&#x27;t very even and slightly orange.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I have tried lots of different self tanners and this is my favorite.  Now purchasing my 3rd bottle.  I love having the convenient pump on this bottle.
