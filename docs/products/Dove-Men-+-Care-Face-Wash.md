      <li>In fact I think the bar may be better.</li>
      <li>the scent was a bit overwhelming...</li>
      <li>But for some reason the face wash didn&#x27;t seem to perform much better than the bar.</li>
      <li>Becaue my face wash is out and also this Dove face wash works better than mine.</li>

      <li>I love how it makes my husband smell hehehehee</li>

      <li>Smells great and is very lathery to leave my skin feeling smooth an refreshed every morning</li>

      <li>Then, he started using it and fell in love with how smooth it made his face.  </li>
      <li>As I quickly approach my 40th birthday, I&#x27;m becoming more and more concerned with my skin.  </li>

      <li>so this is a nice product to switch to for a more gentle cleanse.  </li>

      <li>Dove Men+Care Hydrate Face wash is a welcome addition to my daily routine.  </li>

      <li>Makes my face feel clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, leaves skin smooth and does not dry my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and spend a couple of dollars more on something with better ingredients that can provide a gentle but  thorough clean and then  follow up with a good facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>After I use it, i feel my skin soft and not dry any more!!!!!</li>
      <li>my boy and I love this so much!</li>
      <li>Its okay works great for the face but doesn&#x27;t really hydrate the face enough.</li>

      <li>Rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t take a lot.</li>
      <li>Keeps your face clean and hydrated</li>
      <li>_ clean your face, this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For what it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s the best on te market</li>
    <li> Very high quality, and the scent is great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice because of the price, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of moisturizing. My face always dries out after washing with this stuff, but my face does get dry from time to time. Probably would be great for people who don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> I personally thought it was great, until my roommate&#x27;s girlfriend used it. She thought it made her gay as it said &amp;#34;Added care for Men&#x27;s skin&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My face under my beard tends to dry out for some reason.  This face wash does a good job of keeping the skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most gentle facewashes I have ever used; it leaves your face feeling super smooth. However, I use it with another kind of soap because I&#x27;m not sure if it is getting the cleaning job done that I feel like I need. Great for both pre and post shave however, it softens your facial hair really well and then prevents razor burn afterwards. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I use this about every 3rd day, and have really enjoyed the results. I use it in the shower, then use jojoba oil (like 2-3 drops) on my face when I get out.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with a sponge, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;exfoliating beads&amp;#34; (which are bad for the environment anyways). I really enjoy this product, and it seems to last a long time, so the price is good too.</li>
    <li> At the beginning, I purchased this face wash for my boy friend, but right now I use it every day! Becaue my face wash is out and also this Dove face wash works better than mine. After I use it, i feel my skin soft and not dry any more!!!!! my boy and I love this so much!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I take a shower and it works great. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it. My face gets oily and this takes out the shine but also leaves it soft and healthy feeling. Another benefit is that it softens my facial hair before I shave.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it.  And no environmentally unfriendly micro beads!</li>
    <li> Just like the Dove Men +Care body wash, I really wanted to like this product. It might be ok for occasional use in dry weather, but it left a film on my face that I assume was supposed to be part of the hydration. Instead it felt sticky and seemed to interfere with the surfactants that are the usual cheap, harsh but (normally)  effective variety. Do yourself a favor and spend a couple of dollars more on something with better ingredients that can provide a gentle but  thorough clean and then  follow up with a good facial moisturizer. Dove is filling its products with inferior ingredients and relying solely on marketing.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews about this.  This turns into a really nice thick lather and washes away completely.  Skin feels very clean but doesn&#x27;t get tight.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your face all greasy looking either.  Ok the smell may be a little annoying but if that is the case get the sensitive skin one.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this and even prefer it over CeraVe moisturizing wash.</li>
    <li> Cleans my face, very mild.</li>
    <li> i can really feel the difference, my face feels way cleaner, not dry at all, is just a good feeling, better than soap, u cant go wrong with dove, ill buy again this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I purchased the item for my boyfreind, he loves it</li>
    <li> A fresher experience than just soap.</li>
    <li> Dove makes great products and their men&#x27;s line of soaps continues to impress me.  This stuff smells great (Wife approved) and quickly foams up when you use a small amount.  Be careful not to squeeze the tube too much since you do not need a lot for it to work.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and seems to control the oil longer than other brands.</li>
    <li> Softer, moisturized skin for a smooth shave and reduced acne.</li>
    <li> My skin doesnt really feel hydrated after each use but it tends to make it feel tight. But I do think this product is worth it. I use it every time before I head off to class.</li>
    <li> I tried this Dove men care and I must say am impress.  You&#x27;ll notice your face looks and feels better when you use this men care item.  Am hooked.</li>
    <li> I own and use a few Dove for Men products, and like all of them thus far. I find them to be much more effective and worthwhile than the Nivea products for men.</li>
    <li> Great face wash.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used several Dove body washes and really liked them but was not really impressed with this product. It really didn&#x27;t seem to hydrate at all, the scent is unimpressive, and it is hard to get the right amount out or the tube it comes out so fast. Not a terrible product just not that great to me.</li>
    <li> The only face wash my husband will use. It is not drying and does not irritate. Great quality at a low price!! We are a family that loves Dove products. You cannot ask for anything more from such a great brand!</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my husband smell hehehehee</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product has enough umph to handle the needs of a teenager but for adults who just want a clean face, this stuff is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have went through a lot of face washes and have been using Nivea for years. I have now switched</li>
    <li> I have been useing dove products for many years now I think it is the best</li>
    <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
    <li> well for the price. I have bought better face wash products than this face cleaner but those products are much more expensive. Solid buy for the money.</li>
    <li> It makes my face very comfortable after I used.</li>
    <li> I have the same product that I got from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;The old one was very thick so the soap didn&#x27;t come out unless I squeeze container.&lt;br /&gt;However, the one I ordered from here is so watery.&lt;br /&gt;Soap comes out like diarrhea as soon as I open the cap.&lt;br /&gt;I will return this item.</li>
    <li> It cleans and moisturizes skin. it smells pleasant. I am using it daily to wash my face. Will be better if menthol added.</li>
    <li> After using this product for the last 48 days, my facial skin felt tight and dehydrated. Some users commented, &amp;#34;...the scent was a bit overwhelming...&amp;#34; but the one I have received must be a defect  (it was underwhelming - the scent reminded me of one of those deodorant bar soaps made for men). This is NOT an invigorating facial scrub product, but a high priced face wash product for men (and maybe for women, as well). Bottom line: Gently cleanses while depleting moisturized (facial) skin. Made in U.S.A.</li>
    <li> This soap won&#x27;t necessarily make you more manly but it will get you clean. And all without smelling like a girl. There&#x27;s no particularly manly feature discernible other than the packaging having darker colors. Functionally, it gets the job done and seems a little less drying to the skin than a basic bar of soap. It probably won&#x27;t make you stronger, grow more hair on your chest, or otherwise increase manliness but does a pretty decent job of cleaning up after a day of manly activity. Who said you can&#x27;t be manly and clean?</li>
    <li> The same as I got from store but about $1 cheaper. Great!</li>
    <li> The ladies will love the way your face feels and smellsüòç</li>
    <li> The product is good but no better and not much different from Nivea or other brands.  I was hoping it was a panacea for the skin dryness that I get during winter.  Alas, there is no substitute for water, or humidity for that matter.  In the dryness of winter, some people&#x27;s skin just developes &#x27;issues&#x27; and mine does.  This is a fine product but it cannot emulsify skin sufficiently to stave off skin flaking and dryness for very long.</li>
    <li> After using this product my face didn&#x27;t feel refreshed or clean. I would stick with the clearasil facewash as a better product.</li>
    <li> Feels great  will buy again</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with the price range as my Son can only use this face wash and he needed it plenty to take to College.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking to order again soon..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a week and my complexion has already improved quite a bit. \\&quot;Hydrate\\&quot; is such a good marketing word to use for a face wash. What it basically means is that it cleans your face and doesn&#x27;t leave it nearly as dry as normal face washes. My face still feels a little dry after using it, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It feels clean. I would highly recommend this face wash, whether you have sensitive skin or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Been using it for a few weeks now and I have nothing but good things to say about it. This is marketed as a face wash that \\&quot;mildly cleans\\&quot; without drying out your face. As far as I can tell it cleans just as well as the washes marketed towards doing so. I have it in the shower and use it during my nightly shower. This is a great product and I don&#x27;t see myself changing brands anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Its okay works great for the face but doesn&#x27;t really hydrate the face enough. It seems to still leave my face a bit dry.  It does seem to last a long time. Like the smell. Better then most men products for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, leaves skin smooth and does not dry my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Does a really good job of cleaning my face, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have those annoying little beads many other brands have (they are bad for the environment and are too small to be filtered by most municipal water systems). No 5 star because sometimes I feel like I have to use a lot of it at once to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is very lathery to leave my skin feeling smooth an refreshed every morning and that&#x27;s coming from someone with a beard!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome. Works great, smells amazing, and does exactly what it says it will do. If you&#x27;re looking for something heavy duty to _really_ clean your face, this probably isn&#x27;t it. But that aside, this stuff is worth what you pay.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face washes out there. It leaves the skin feeling clean and hydrated at the same time, something which not many products out in the market would be able to achieve.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Dove as a product and always think of it as a trusted name in soap. Its the only soap my wife will buy for herself and our little son. But for some reason the face wash didn&#x27;t seem to perform much better than the bar. In fact I think the bar may be better. My skin felt drier and I felt like I needed lotion on my face because it was too tight. I have used oatmeal soap and black soap in the past with better results. I know these companies want to have products to continue to capitalize on the brand, but a simple bar soap for men would be better than this gel.</li>
    <li> I got this Hydrating Face Wash for my husband, who gets dry skin, especially during winter months.  After using it for a week he says \\&quot;It Works.\\&quot;  Well, that isn&#x27;t very helpful, so I gave it a try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was a nice gentle face wash with undertones of the classic Dove scent, only slightly more manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used together with the Dove Hydrating Facial Lotion, it works quite well, leaving skin feeling hydrated buy not oily.</li>
    <li> Have tried both the Sensitive and the Hydrate face washes. They both work great. Feels good going on and does a nice job of cleaning up my mug without drying it out. I tend to like a hard deep clean scrub on my face so I typically use a wash with some form of grit.  However, I don&#x27;t want that everyday so this is a nice product to switch to for a more gentle cleanse.  I prefer the Hydrate over the Sensitive which although is supposed to be \\&quot;scent neutral\\&quot; actually has a bit of an odd smell. The Hydrate has a nice mild mature scent that is not at all overpowering. My only gripe is that they are a little pricey for the amount you get. Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this face wash because I think it&#x27;s a pretty good value compared to other face washes. It cleans well without leaving a ton of residue that takes forever to rinse off, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that tingly feeling that other face washes have to let you know it&#x27;s on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your face dries out with other more intense face washes, give this a shot! It leaves my skin feeling much more moisturized compared to face washes that give that menthol feeling.</li>
    <li> Dove Men Care Hydrate face wash doesn&#x27;t differ very much from Doves&#x27; hydrate face bar. The face wash lathers very nicely and is easily rinsed off though it does not last as long as the bar version. The fragrance is a bit light and maybe not very masculine smelling, but it does not linger very long and is easily masked by cologne.</li>
    <li> Buy these all the time they are great.</li>
    <li> Smells great, can&#x27;t really tell if it hydrates that well but I love the dove men series of everything and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Keep me clean and good appearance.</li>
    <li> I really expected this to be a great face soap.  It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Hydrate\\&quot; so I expected it would hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the opposite.  Dove Men Care Hydrate smells like regular bar soap and left my face just as dry.  I wanted to like it but this isn&#x27;t up to snuff.  I much prefer Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash, 5.1 Ounce.</li>
    <li> My husband laughed at me when I ordered the Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Wash.  He was never going to use this.  Then, he started using it and fell in love with how smooth it made his face.  He&#x27;ll never use another product again, this was amazing, a great buy.</li>
    <li> As I quickly approach my 40th birthday, I&#x27;m becoming more and more concerned with my skin.  I don&#x27;t want to be a 50 year old leather face or look ten years older than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Men+Care Hydrate Face wash is a welcome addition to my daily routine.  I didn&#x27;t feel any greasy residue after using it and it lathered nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any gentlemen.</li>
    <li> I start getting pimples when I use this face wash. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t suit my skin.</li>
    <li> I found that this does keep my skin moisturized slightly more than usual. I have rough skin that dries out easily, so this has worked well over Nivea and other brands I have used. I use this with a scrub sponge to really clean my pores. It is probably the best product I have used of all the brands at this given time. It hydrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I have noticed a slight decrease in ingrown hairs as well. Moisturizing your face is pretty important from what everyone tells me, so as a lazy person, its nice to have a product that can help me out with that at least a little bit.</li>
    <li> My face feels great after using it... smooth and clean. What else can I say? It is a great product. It has not caused any irritation or anything, so I give it 5 stars and recommend it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t take a lot. I use it after shaving. No tingling or other feeling, just a good wash for the face.</li>
    <li> I use this product a couple times a week.  I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get my husband to WASH his face at the end of the day with no luck. This product is easy to use, fast to wash off and his skin looks radiant and clean! We love it!</li>
    <li> Keeps my face clean, but it isn&#x27;t the more pleasant smell.  It&#x27;s smells much more like a standard Dove bar of soap. If you like that, great, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Dove really has done a great job with all of the items in the &amp;#34;Men +care line&amp;#34; they all work exceptionally well, especially for their price point. The packaging is masculine and they are all either perfume free or masculine scents.&lt;br /&gt;The face wash does a great job of cleaning of my face and keeping it acne free, but not drying it out or making it oily.</li>
    <li> Loved using this face wash. It is a very good quality wash. It has a great scent. Your face feels very clean and refreshed after using. It also moisturizes and hydrated your face. A reasonably priced wash that smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out. Will use again.</li>
    <li> Keeps your face clean and hydrated</li>
    <li> Love the dove for men product line.  This product Softens and cleans gently no more red patchy skin after cleaning my face anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the deepest face wash, but it really does help my skin hydrate, especially since it&#x27;s starting to get cold (my face tends to become dry during the winter time). I try to use this every other day and it lathers well, and makes you skin soft afterwords. Combining this with Dove Men+Care Face Lotion is a great bundle and really helps improve my dry skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated, so there&#x27;s nothing to really complain about (although it would be nice if there were a deeper clean).</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good face wash geared towards men for a while now and I found the Holy Grail. I can not recommend  this enough, Other face washes wound leave my face very dry and sometimes with a burning feeling &amp; red, removes all dirt and grease with out irritation. Not any more, this leave my face hydrated and clean with a refreshing feeling. It works as advertised and then some. Its a soft light cream vs other brands that are in gel form. I also have very sensitive skin so I have to watch what I use or my skin will get very irritated, not with this no irritation and for the price you get go wrong. Give it a try you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> As a guy with an oily face (likely partially due to over obsessing and over washing), I always keep a face cleanser as part of my &#x27;shower kit&#x27;. I ordered a few Dove Men+ kits for Christmas, and decided I would try the Face Wash. I immediately preferred it to my Neutrogena cream that was similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has, in my opinion, a better smell and consistency. It still lathers up quite easily, but I&#x27;d suggest applying more directly to your face rather than lathering up in your hands first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems far less &#x27;harsh&#x27; - that is, it cleans my face quite well but it seems to interrupt my face&#x27;s natural oil and dry it out so badly after the shower. It is very gentle and keeps me from getting that dry nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say. For the price, this will be my new go-to. I think I will try the Sensitive Skin variation of it as well and see if there is a real difference. I have yet to be disappointed with any Men+ products. I especially love their Spray-on Antiperspirant (in the Cool Silver scent).</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this face wash for a month and really like it.  It has a very mild to almost no smell, so for those guys that are not wanting additional scent, this is the perfect product for you.  He washed his face in the shower with this product and it has not dried out his face like some products in the past that he used and then had to stop using. It is a pretty nice sized bottle for the price.  This is a good line of products for Dove.</li>
    <li> Really like this face wash. It offers a little bit of moisturizing, and is gentle enough to not cause your face to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an overpowering scent either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and reviewed some other Dove men&#x27;s products without much enthusiasm, but this is the best of the lot. This is a decent moisturizing face wash, without any obnoxious or overpowering scents. I tend to have dry skin and this handles my skin issues fairly well, although once in a great while I&#x27;ve had to add a lick of moisturizer while using this, but I think that&#x27;s more about my skin than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent addition to the medicine cabinet, and something I&#x27;ll most likely get again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s important to wash your face!! they&#x27;ve told you that since you were a kid, and you know what? it&#x27;s still true. Soap and body wash are fine for everything else but you&#x27;re face is different. This gets all the evil out of your pores and also gets you ready for a good close shave. buy it! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap. I hope it can have the same cleaning function as other brands with higher prices. I am still using proactive face wash, but this one is an alternative for my everyday face cleaning.</li>
    <li> After my shower i used a small amount and applied to my skin. this product is really good i just used a small amount and it spread well did not have to reapply and i felt clean after using it i recommend this to those looking for a new face wash</li>
    <li> Cleans very well, awesome lather.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s face moisturizer for men, not a face wash. I hardly use it and won&#x27;t buy again. To be fair, it does say it on the container that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and mild cleaner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using Dove&#x27;s personal care products for men. (I guess you can&#x27;t still call them \\&quot;beauty products,\\&quot; right?) So far, though, you can definitely call me a fan. I&#x27;ve been trying out this face wash and have been very pleased with the results so far. I typically use this after I shave, which isn&#x27;t every day. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, without being greasy or stinking of perfume. I probably should have gotten the sensitive skin variety, since I definitely have sensitive skin. But so far no problem with breaking out or anything. Another winner from Dove!</li>
    <li> love every dove product</li>
