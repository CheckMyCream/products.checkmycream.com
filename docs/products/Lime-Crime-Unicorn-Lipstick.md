      <li>i really love lime crime product, i have the velvetine lipsticks and love em.</li>
      <li>I AM IN LOVE</li>
      <li>NYX brand is much better.</li>
      <li>, I WISH THE BRAND HAD MORE VARIETY IN WEARABLE SHADES, BECAUSE I WOULD BE BUYING THEM UP.</li>
      <li>DO NOT PAY MORE EVENTUALLY THEY WILL ALL BE PRICED AT $18.</li>
      <li>Love the formula.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute color and all (and the packaging is adorable), but it was so chalky.</li>
      <li>MAKE SURE AMAZON IS THE SHIPPING FULLFILLER, AND WAIT TILL WHICHEVER COLOR</li>
      <li>I have a fair skin color and at first I thought it would look a bit too orangy on me for a nude</li>
      <li>I bought Cosmopop as well because I loved this so much.</li>
      <li>Also the packaging is cheap.</li>
      <li>The pigment is amazing - expect very close to the color you see pictured.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for a 12 year old.</li>
      <li>I was super excited when it arrived, but that soon faded.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super pissed.</li>
      <li>Limecrime already has a super s***y reputation, but this takes the cake.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>Lime Crime is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>The nude color is just right.</li>
      <li>SO FAR I HAVE D&#x27;LILAC, GREAT PINK PLANET, AND</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it instantly!</li>
      <li>Comes on the like the exact color of the model.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new fan and plan to order more lime crime products in the future.</li>
      <li>This will be my third one of the same color that I have bought I love it!</li>
      <li>Much.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to try</li>
      <li>Beautiful pale pink nude color complements my olive toned complexion.</li>
      <li>I AM EXTREMELY PRONE TO DRY CHAPPED LIPS, AND THIS FELT SO NICE ON MY LIPS.</li>
      <li>I mean the actual plastic of the lipstick-- is stunning and super girly.</li>
      <li>the shade was much darker and different from what is shown in the description.</li>
      <li>I have a million lipsticks - everything from drug store to NARS, MAC and professional brands.</li>
      <li>It tastes like the old plastic lipsticks from back in the days.</li>
      <li>The color is pretty but is definitely not at all long lasting!!!!!</li>
      <li>i have a tanner skin color looks little pale had to use lip liner to make better</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also got enough of the pop of color to wear it with just mascara and a bare face.</li>
      <li>THE ONLY SLIGHT ISSUE IS THAT I EXPECTED FROM SWATCH RESEARCH VIA GOOGLE, FOR THIS TO LOOK MORE PALE THAN IT DOES,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tried it on when I received it and it looked great!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful lipstick</li>
    <li> so beautiful! it makes my lips attractive</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to try this lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;The product came within a week. I am disappointed with the color. On the picture it looks pale but what I got is peachy with orange under color. I will have to give it away. Also, I do not like the smell and taste. It tastes like the old plastic lipsticks from back in the days. Also the packaging is cheap. This is a good product for a 12 year old.</li>
    <li> This will be my third one of the same color that I have bought I love it! It has a really nice cupcake smell to it. I refuse to wear any other lipsticks after trying lime crime now</li>
    <li> Product received as description but, lip stick dries your lips a lot. Ensure to moisturize your lips prior to using the lip stick. The color is pigmented and blends well with other lip sticks.</li>
    <li> Comes on the like the exact color of the model.</li>
    <li> Just not a fan of the texture of this lippie.  It doesn&#x27;t cover properly.  NYX brand is much better.</li>
    <li> The nude color is just right. It is not too peachy and not brownish at all. It is creamy but matt and if you like your lips shiny just put some lipshine over it and voala</li>
    <li> Love the formula. Smells great. Color is just way too orangey which I didn&#x27;t expect after reading all the reviews I did, and seeing multiple swatches.</li>
    <li> THE TEXTURE IS WONDERFUL, RICH OPAQUE COLOR. I AM EXTREMELY PRONE TO DRY CHAPPED LIPS, AND THIS FELT SO NICE ON MY LIPS. I AM IN LOVE, I WISH THE BRAND HAD MORE VARIETY IN WEARABLE SHADES, BECAUSE I WOULD BE BUYING THEM UP. SO FAR I HAVE D&#x27;LILAC, GREAT PINK PLANET, AND THIS, COQUETTE. THE ONLY SLIGHT ISSUE IS THAT I EXPECTED FROM SWATCH RESEARCH VIA GOOGLE, FOR THIS TO LOOK MORE PALE THAN IT DOES, BUT I STILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! MAKE SURE AMAZON IS THE SHIPPING FULLFILLER, AND WAIT TILL WHICHEVER COLOR YOU WANT IS $18, AS THAT IS RETAIL PRICE FOR IT VIA LIMECRIME.COM , AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO. DO NOT PAY MORE EVENTUALLY THEY WILL ALL BE PRICED AT $18. JUST BE PATIENT. THEY SMELL QUITE SIMILAR TO MAC LIPSTICKS ALSO. I AM HOOKED</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nude lipstick!</li>
    <li> So. Much. Darker. Than. Pictured. :(</li>
    <li> Actual color of the photo thing was completely different.And this item can not be returned I&#x27;ve wasted money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!0 Star</li>
    <li> i have a tanner skin color looks little pale had to use lip liner to make better</li>
    <li> I have a million lipsticks - everything from drug store to NARS, MAC and professional brands. Lime Crime is by far my favorite. The pigment is amazing - expect very close to the color you see pictured. It&#x27;s actually hydrating and lasts longer than any other formula I&#x27;ve tried. Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out terribly either - which I&#x27;ve always had a problem with in the past with other lipsticks. I bought Cosmopop as well because I loved this so much. The colors are perfect - I get so many compliments every time I wear Coquette because it&#x27;s the perfect combo of nude and pinky/peach. It&#x27;s nude enough that you can wear it with a smokey eye but it&#x27;s also got enough of the pop of color to wear it with just mascara and a bare face. I can also put it on before I go out and only have to re-apply once. AND Lime Crime is cruelty free/Vegan....even better!</li>
    <li> I was super excited when it arrived, but that soon faded. It&#x27;s a cute color and all (and the packaging is adorable), but it was so chalky. It looked like I was wearing crayons on my lips.</li>
    <li> Color is not like picture</li>
    <li> very dry bad quality.</li>
    <li> Best peachy nude lipstick!</li>
    <li> The lipstick looks beautiful! I have a fair skin color and at first I thought it would look a bit too orangy on me for a nude but it looked awesome. Its consistency is very creamy which moisturizes the lips just perfectly and it smells awesome. I fell in love with it instantly! The packaging --and by that I mean the actual plastic of the lipstick-- is stunning and super girly. This lipstick made me fall in love with Lime Crime; more please!</li>
    <li> the shade was much darker and different from what is shown in the description. you cannot send it back, even with prime. i guess because it&#x27;s a cosmetic product. it&#x27;s sitting in my lipstick holder and i haven&#x27;t used it since i bought it. i really love lime crime product, i have the velvetine lipsticks and love em. however this product color display did not line up. i&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> The color is pretty but is definitely not at all long lasting!!!!! Not true !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Limecrime already has a super s***y reputation, but this takes the cake. I&#x27;m super pissed. They don&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pale pink nude color complements my olive toned complexion. It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth. I&#x27;m a new fan and plan to order more lime crime products in the future.</li>
