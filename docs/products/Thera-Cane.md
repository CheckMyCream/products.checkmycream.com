      <li>I am a little jealous of the delicious moans and groans she makes while using it.</li>
      <li>Works great for giving yourself a deep tissue massage.</li>

      <li>Excellent tool for those hard to reach muscles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s proven itself to be good for the neck, shoulders and smaller muscles .</li>
      <li>The Thera Cane comes with more knobs on it than I know how to use, and isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use as the lady in the photo seems to imply, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: it allows the user to exert pressure accurately on a circumscribed area out of reach on the back.  </li>
      <li>its a miracle, helps with muscle pains, quick relief.</li>
      <li>This is a handy extra arm and hand to reach places to give pain relief.</li>
      <li>I can get knots out of my own back and shoulders.  </li>
      <li>(most people will do this quite naturally) and work the rounded knob into that muscle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much pressure you can rub your own neck/back with, and there is no strain and very little strength needed to do it.  </li>
      <li>I used it at my personal trainer&#x27;s and liked it so much</li>
      <li>but It also works great for my neck, upper back, and even my feet.</li>
      <li>I keep it right next to my chair and have used it many times while watching TV.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>A back saver for sure.  </li>
      <li>Great for loosening up tight muscles in your back.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s really because I have some abnormal problem in my calves</li>
      <li>It really relieves sore muscles.</li>
      <li>This is very helpful for temporary relief.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy.</li>
      <li>She was a little unsure at first, but soon grew to love it.</li>
      <li>The only place where I haven&#x27;t had success with this thing is forearms and calves (including feet and ankles).  </li>
      <li>wouldn’t live without one of these.</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to get to those hard to reach areas.</li>
      <li>I have a big gut, am 220 lbs and had no trouble using the Thera Cane.</li>
      <li>But as I read the other reviews on that competitor, those who purchased it found it pretty much equally functional.</li>

<li> This helps so much when you have a knot in your neck or back, and nobody can rub you hard enough or long enough to make it go away.  </li>
<li> Works very well to reach spots that are hard to reach.</li>
<li> Wish I had know about this a long time ago.  </li>
<li> Takes the stress off your arm and shoulder joints from trying to reach places that you do not naturally or normally extend your reach to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Even surprised my skeptical 28 yr old son!</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll need to identify the center of the tightness</li>
<li> Because I&#x27;m overcoming physical damage, I paid the small difference to adhere to the therapists recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I use it a few times a week for just a few minutes and it makes a big difference in how my back/shoulders feel.</li>
<li> This thing is my little buddy now.  </li>
<li> It has worked so well that I find that I hardly even need it anymore.  </li>
<li> My MT showed me this after I told her how hard it was to do Pressure Points on myself.  </li>
<li> so I thought there would as least be some instruction.</li>
<li> This thing is a game changer.</li>
<li> The info on the purchase site was vague.</li>
<li> I was disappointed to find that the instructions were not included with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Even though the Thera Cane was not for me, the person who used it, told me that helped him a lot. Tks.</li>
    <li> My MT showed me this after I told her how hard it was to do Pressure Points on myself.  This tool is absolutely amazing.  Wish I had know about this a long time ago.  Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> Works great for giving yourself a deep tissue massage. Never used a better device. Able to hit all my pressure points with ease. I have a big gut, am 220 lbs and had no trouble using the Thera Cane. Bought specifically for my lower back but It also works great for my neck, upper back, and even my feet. This thing is a game changer.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this and I am really happy with it.  I have been going to a chiropractor and I can now manipulate the areas on my body easily with the Theracane massager.  It is like a deep tissue massage.  It really relieves sore muscles.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  This helps so much when you have a knot in your neck or back, and nobody can rub you hard enough or long enough to make it go away.  It&#x27;s amazing how much pressure you can rub your own neck/back with, and there is no strain and very little strength needed to do it.  I keep it right next to my chair and have used it many times while watching TV.  It has worked so well that I find that I hardly even need it anymore.  Just don&#x27;t show it to anyone because they&#x27;ll try to take it home.</li>
    <li> It worked wonderfully to rub out my knots and pressure points.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that the instructions were not included with this product. The info on the purchase site was vague. It was recommended to me from my chiropractor so I thought there would as least be some instruction.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for tension and knots that form between the neck and shoulders, and in the shoulder-blade areas - or anywhere that you can&#x27;t reach otherwise.  My massage therapist recommended it to me and my husband and friends like it too.</li>
    <li> Works very well to reach spots that are hard to reach. Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is a handy extra arm and hand to reach places to give pain relief.</li>
    <li> This thing gets rid of more headaches than anything any doctor has ever prescribed.  I&#x27;ve had multiple back surgeries, and I&#x27;d bet I could have done without a couple of them had I found this thing in time.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for those hard to reach muscles.</li>
    <li> its a miracle, helps with muscle pains, quick relief. i see lot of difference. it relieves muscle tightness in a second</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product was as promised!  Makes it easy to get to those hard to reach areas. Thank you</li>
    <li> This cane is so helpful in working through pressure point therapy at home.  My therapist helped me learn to apply the pressure correctly.</li>
    <li> This is very helpful for temporary relief. Help for awhile but has to be reused offen to keep pain away</li>
    <li> Great for loosening up tight muscles in your back. I use it a few times a week for just a few minutes and it makes a big difference in how my back/shoulders feel.</li>
    <li> A back saver for sure.  I used it at my personal trainer&#x27;s and liked it so much I got my own. Even surprised my skeptical 28 yr old son!</li>
    <li> The Thera Cane comes with more knobs on it than I know how to use, and isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use as the lady in the photo seems to imply, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: it allows the user to exert pressure accurately on a circumscribed area out of reach on the back.  And... it actually seems to help, for which as a chronic pain patient I&#x27;m grateful.</li>
    <li> My physical therapist recommended this.  It has proven quite effective at loosening tight/cramped muscles. EXCELLENT for pressuring out knots from almost anywhere on your body... recently used it on a leg cramp - it knocked it out in &amp;lt;2 minutes. You&#x27;ll need to identify the center of the tightness (most people will do this quite naturally) and work the rounded knob into that muscle. Easy to use and Fairly strong. Takes the stress off your arm and shoulder joints from trying to reach places that you do not naturally or normally extend your reach to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I read the reviews before buying I noticed that 2 came from therapists.  One said she had both this one and it&#x27;s competitor. In her opinion, the Theracane was slightly better designed and worked better than the other popular brand.  But as I read the other reviews on that competitor, those who purchased it found it pretty much equally functional. Because I&#x27;m overcoming physical damage, I paid the small difference to adhere to the therapists recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: Purchased the Mini to travel with also (it offset the cost of shipping). It&#x27;s proven itself to be good for the neck, shoulders and smaller muscles .</li>
    <li> Lives up to its claims. Would buy again. The instructions are well written and easy to follow. Please give it a try.</li>
    <li> Excelente for massage!</li>
    <li> I bought the Theracane as a gift for my wife after seeing someone in my office use it. She was a little unsure at first, but soon grew to love it. I am a little jealous of the delicious moans and groans she makes while using it. ;)</li>
    <li> wouldn’t live without one of these. SO EASY TO USE WHEN NO ONE ELSE IS AROUND TO REACH THOSE PLACES THAT NEED ATTENTION.</li>
    <li> This thing is my little buddy now.  I find myself using it compulsively.  The only place where I haven&#x27;t had success with this thing is forearms and calves (including feet and ankles).  But that&#x27;s really because I have some abnormal problem in my calves I think.  Works great everywhere else.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what my wife needs</li>
    <li> If you have fibromyalgia and get knots in your muscles, this is a must.  I can get knots out of my own back and shoulders.  Was recommended by my physical therapist.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Nice. Works the way it is supposed to. Helpful!</li>
    <li> my teenager uses this all the time  helps alot</li>
    <li> If you have neck problems this is a must! I loved this product so much after I got one as a Christmas gift, I had to get my Dad one.</li>
    <li> I just wish it came with a manual. It sure does help get the knots out.</li>
