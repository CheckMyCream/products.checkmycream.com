<li> Go Away Face Wash by Olay, Milk of Magnesium and Neutrogena Shine Control as a primer and finish my makeup with a blotting matte powder and a few spritzes of Skindinavia</li>
<li> No More Shine Makeup Finishing Spray.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s set for at LEAST a 6 hour wear.</li>
<li> boy was i wrong.</li>
<li> Every since I have gotten this foundation I have not reached for my expensive MAC foundation at all.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I prefer the pump bottle foundations as opposed to the glass bottle you have to shake/dab/dump onto your makeup sponge to use. I do love the variety of colors for brown skin ladies coming out lately. And not just the light, medium, dark. All ladies are all colors of the rainbow! Please diversify makeup companies! Looks lovely on my skin and it does help control the oil for awhile, but keep the blotting papers (or the perm end papers where you can get 1000 for $2 at Sallys or online  instead of 20 blotting papers for $10? Um, yes please!) handy and touchup powder because you will shine through after 4 hours or so. I even use Shine Shine Go Away Face Wash by Olay, Milk of Magnesium and Neutrogena Shine Control as a primer and finish my makeup with a blotting matte powder and a few spritzes of Skindinavia No More Shine Makeup Finishing Spray. Still haven&#x27;t found that one thing that works or even combo of things that work to keep the shine away for 8-12 hours. Cest la via.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on some great reviews I&#x27;ve heard and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Even though the colour is just a tad darker than my complexion, I can make it work. This foundation is creamy, but not too heavy, and by the time I&#x27;m finished, it does exactly what it says, makes me look matte and poreless. Now since I&#x27;m an oily girl, I still use a mattifying primer underneath cause I&#x27;m not taking any chances. I&#x27;d say after a few hours I&#x27;m only slightly shiny, which is great for me. As most people have already said, yes I wish it came with a pump, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. It&#x27;s much better than a lot of high end foundations I&#x27;ve used, so I&#x27;d definitely repurchase. Good going Maybelline!</li>
    <li> HOLY GRAIL!! Every since I have gotten this foundation I have not reached for my expensive MAC foundation at all. This foundation fits me perfectly and really helps fill my massive pores and the color match is perfect</li>
    <li> I love my Maybelline Fit Me in the Matte. It gives you a flawless foundation without being cakey or looking like you have a ton of makeup on. It&#x27;s very light and often makes me feel like I have nothing on. It blends very well with my concealers. It is a great foundation for contouring. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I may mix with the 360 but to color match a little more but even without the tone works well with my complextion. I use a blending sponge so I don&#x27;t have streaks from brushes, but I just got a new set so I&#x27;ll have to test it with the brushes.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price....</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast delivery!!! My sister love it.. Her face look beautiful with it. :-)</li>
    <li> This foundation is amazing. I get so many compliments. As a black woman, it&#x27;s difficult to find foundations that match my color exactly. This is perfect for the winter when I lighten up and for the summer when I tan. I have oily skin and this if the first liquid foundation I can use. No break outs. Smells pleasant. I bought 3 more for storage or in case they discontinue line.</li>
    <li> Suggest you buy at the drug store,  its less than $6.00 there. But great product</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! It is simply amazing! It definitely goes on matte and I love it.</li>
    <li> Almost a perfect match for my skin tone and it covers my pores nicely. I absolutely love the matte finish</li>
    <li> Product is great. Blends wonderfully.  I only have to apply my makeup once and it&#x27;s set for at LEAST a 6 hour wear. (Maybe longer but I haven&#x27;t needed it for longer) Cheap price, worth the buy.!!</li>
    <li> I bought  this foundation  thinking it could  replace  my revlon colorstay ohhh boy was i wrong. The coverage  was good but I found  that at the end of the day the foundation  started  to separate  around  my mouth  and it wasn&#x27;t pretty. This did not  make  me matte either  as i have very oily  skin  and i even  used the milk of magnesia  with it and i wasnt matte all day. It also  did  nothing  for my pores  as they were still visible  even  after application. So now because  I don&#x27;t  want to waste  the product I only  wear it when I want to run sone errands thats and not  a all day look.</li>
    <li> I freaking love it! Flawless!</li>
    <li> Perfect shade. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> nice coverage, build-able, i apply with sponge and its nice</li>
    <li> Maybelline is one of the best drug store foundations for African American women, my experience. Please do not change the formula. Smooth, no streaks, drys quickly without looking chalky. Looks very natural on face. Great price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great after 8 hours</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be a great foundation.  It blends well; it covers well but yet it&#x27;s light.</li>
    <li> Never had a foundation that matched my skin color so PERFECTLY! This is amazing for a drugstore foundation.  Stays matte and fills in pores just like the name states.  A MUST HAVE!</li>
