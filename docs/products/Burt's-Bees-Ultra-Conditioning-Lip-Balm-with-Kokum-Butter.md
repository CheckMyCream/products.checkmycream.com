<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well, it is what I need</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s pricey, but that&#x27;s because it works.  It keeps lips protected by keeping the moisture in.  If used often, it keeps lips soft &amp; smooth, with a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> Very similar to petroleum jelly- shiny but thin, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This was for my son.  His lips are always dry.  It helps a lot when he uses this during the night.  Love Burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
    <li> This is  the best lip balm you can buy..Just love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm, lip gloss, lip butter fanatic- I must have at least several dozen tubes, sticks and tins tucked around the house, but  this one is my absolute favorite!  I love how it glides on and especially the way it feels on my lips- so very soft, buttery and pampered.  My lips feel drenched in moisture!  It is 100% natural and the kokum butter really must be the difference.  Not at all sticky, greasy or waxy.  Perfect!  Burt&#x27;s Bees- please do not ever discontinue this one!  It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Really nice chapstick, smooth and soft, not waxy.  The smell is light and pleasant.  I have this as part of my auto subscription &amp; save, makes it even a little cheaper.  It is much less expensive here than at a store locally.  I like Nivea lips stuff the best, but this is almost as good.</li>
    <li> good！good！thank you Amazon！</li>
    <li> The best lip moisturizer ever! I was having chronic dry lips and using lip balm constantly. I tried other brands which claimed to be medicated, and they did nothing to heal my chapped lips. I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, and my lips are back to normal! It&#x27;s soothing and moisturizing and natural! Win win win!</li>
    <li> This is a hypoallergenic chap stick which my wife loves to use. We will order these again in the future. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but it really moisturize my lips.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.  However, after using it for a few days I was noticing it just was not lasting as long as other brands I have tried.  I felt like I had to reapply a lot more than was necessary.  Love Burt&#x27;s Bees but sadly I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t keep your lips moisturized for very long</li>
    <li> Good, very moist! Winter use is appropriate!</li>
    <li> I just loved it and it is really good</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s bees and this is not an exception. Good smooth lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> its lipbalm.  it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before and had extremely different results. Bought it from local pharmacy a few months ago and I really enjoyed it&#x27;s effectiveness. I don&#x27;t know what the hell this is caused by, but this is just bad,. Causes more dryness and has this awful burning sensation, I thought maybe my lips were just not used to it yet, but nope. After three days of reapplication my lips are damaged beyond belief. THIS IT NOT WHAT I EXPECT FROM AMAZON! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> After only 2 days of using this lip balm, my lover commented that my lips were &amp;#34;softer than ever!&amp;#34; She didn&#x27;t even know I was using it until after. A+++++ product. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to make my lips drier.  At the very least, it gives them this icky pasty texture that is quite uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to the classic Burt&#x27;s Bees!  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> was still allergic, sad</li>
    <li> I only use Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
    <li> I agree with the negative comments about this product.  My lips just felt drier and drier after I started using it a few days ago.  I also put things together and quit using it, but by that time my lips and just inside my mouth were starting to burn and swell and form  lesions like canker sores.  I bought quite a few products seeking relief but even the Orajel could not numb the discomfort.  Can&#x27;t swear this was all due to the lip balm but seems a possibility.  Other Burt&#x27;s Bees products have been wonderful</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this lip balm is great.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit like mosquito spray/baby wipe but applies very smooth, works well and is natural. I was disappointed I only got ONE chap-stick even though the ad says pack of 2 (and some people claim they got 2, some people got 1...kinda messy as far as fair business goes).</li>
    <li> I like it but seem to lose one about every other week, doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent which is my buying point</li>
    <li> Works wonderful, cleared up my chapped lips instantly!</li>
    <li> After being a chapstick addict for years I stopped using petroleum-based balms a while ago. Yet I&#x27;m actually not a big Burt&#x27;s Bees fan; I use other natural balms instead. I haven&#x27;t liked the other Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s lip balms because they&#x27;re unpleasantly sticky. I tried one and never bought another... until this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Burt&#x27;s Bees Ultra Conditioning Lip Balm at Walmart because I was desperate for a fix, and I really like it. It&#x27;s not sticky and goes on smooth. It&#x27;s made of several kinds of natural oils which are good for your lips. It feels more like &amp;#34;lip butter&amp;#34; than balm, which is a different kind of product than balm. I normally buy and prefer lip butter. So of course I liked this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why are the Amazon reviews so polarized?&lt;br /&gt;I think the price might be what&#x27;s putting so many people off. Even at Wal-mart, the Ultra Conditioning Lip Balm costs about $1 more than the other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms. If it had cost the same, people probably wouldn&#x27;t be so upset. It&#x27;s also different from the usual Burts Bees stuff, which is good for some people and bad for others. Like I said, I don&#x27;t like the other ones, but I like this one!</li>
    <li> The most moisturizing lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used- and I&#x27;ve tried all the brands!!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is great stuff, I am a big fan of many of their products.  This lip balm is soft and luscious with no strong flavors or aromas.</li>
    <li> I have never really been a fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees chap-stick line, but when I saw the packaging say &amp;#34;Ultra Conditioning&amp;#34; I thought I would give the company another chance.  When I first applied the balm it glided on my lips nicely, and left them feeling soft and refreshed...for the first two minutes.  After waiting around a little I went to go look in the mirror and noticed that my lips looked more chapped.  The fine lines of my lips became prominent and my lips looked as if they were shriveling up and about to fall off.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms have always made my lips feel tight and dry, so not only did it effect my lips but the way I looked when I smiled or talked looked really awkward.  It looked like something was covering my lips keeping them from moving freely.  I do not recommend this product, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize, and in some cases it might make the problem worse.</li>
    <li> Hands down best chapstick around!</li>
    <li> The BEST chapstick out there! Glides on smooth, not sticky. You can feel it conditioning and hydrating your dry lips.  I have one in every purse, on my bedstand, in my makeup case.  Have purchased at least 6!</li>
    <li> The only Burts Bees lip balm worth using as far as I am concerned. I love the feel of it and the smell is so yummy!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees product. It&#x27;s so hydrating and goes on very smoothly. My lips get chapped a lot during the winter and this helps enormously. I don&#x27;t leave the house without it! I&#x27;m surprised that this got a lot of bad reviews. I say try it for yourself and see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the most frustrating and impractical thing you could. This stuff is like putting oil on your lips and my lips literally felt worse (rough, peeling) after using it. The oils just sit on top of the skin leaving them feeling slippery. greasy, shiny and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 STARS, Its not @ all what I thought it would be. It does go on really smooth. &amp; it actually stays on for (4hours). If you DON&#x27;T EAT OR DRINK! LOL</li>
    <li> Two stars because it is great if you don have access to any other type of lip balm. I love the original type of Bert&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  This ultra conditioning balm leaves my lips feeling less moisterized, it glazes over the top but doesn&#x27;t actually hydrate the skin at all. I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees. My favorite is the Lifeguard&#x27;s Choice, which unfortunately was discontinued. So, I decided to try this one. Huge let down. This lip balm doesn&#x27;t keep your lips moisturized for more than a few minutes. Then you have to reapply. Just like the Chapstick brand. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is not bad but I feel that the Burts Bees original is more helpful in fighting chapped hurting lips. Sometimes less is more and this might be one of those times. The Ultra has a lot of ingredients trying to be all things. Left lips dryer after a few minutes</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and a lot of products make me break out. This lip balm really helped my lips in the winter love it will always have it in my purse from now on.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my most favorite lip balm out of all the balms I have ever used.  It glides on so silky smooth and makes my lips feel nourished.  I liked it so much I had to order more!</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this Lip balm. Smooth and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This balm has been a lifesaver for me so far this dry, cold winter. It is definitely not a daytime balm as it&#x27;s very greasy with no waxy protection against the elements, you&#x27;ll want another burts balm for that, but as a overnight CONDITIONING balm as the name implies, this is amazing. I wake up with perfectly soft remoisturized lips. And as someone who has chronically chapped lips, even in summer humidity, that&#x27;s really saying something.</li>
    <li> I love the regular lip balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees and I wanted to give this one a try since during winter I suffer from very dry lips. I really dislike it though, too liquidy and gloss like, does not stay on lips.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It actually made my lips more chapped like other people said too. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this product and had to try something new because I knew there was more out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend QTICA intense lip therapy balm. This has changed my life and is MUCH BETTER. I have only used it a little but feel a large difference.</li>
    <li> Feels greasy, weird scent, made my lips drier when I used it. Really terrible stuff. And it costs more than their regular lip balm!</li>
    <li> I like how it smells, lemony, even though its not the flavor of this lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Its very hydrating and moisturizing. A bit on the oily side, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I am a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan. There is no other chapstick out there  that can compare. Since I  was little ive suffer from severe chapped/dried/cracked lips. With  the changing  season my lips suffer severely. Some months are worse than others. I use the regular  Burt&#x27;s  Bee&#x27;s  chapstick constantly  but when my  lips  get severe I  struggle to find anything  to keep  them moisterized until I  discovered  this ultra highdrating chapstick. It has honestly  changed my life. I cant leave the house without  it. The label saids it keeps  you moisterized  up to 4hrs and its  completely  true. It has Kokum butter  which I think  it makes it truly  soft and  very smooth. Its fragrance free and all natural. This is my holly grail. I find myself grabbing for it constantly  because my lips just  love it. After using this product  for a month my lips have been looking healthier</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. After you put it on it last for hours and is nice and creamy. I was in the hospital for several weeks,I had very chapped lips and they improved over night with this. Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
    <li> Feels silky smooth on your lips!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very rich, smooth and smells great!  Makes my lips feel pampered.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants their lips to feel and look their best!</li>
    <li> This has very light and rich moisturizing formula. I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> My wife says it is good</li>
    <li> I purchased this lip balm and absolutely hate it. I usually use the original Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and works fine.  I got this one to &amp;#34;Try&amp;#34; it and it make my lips so chapped.  Stay away!!!</li>
    <li> not what I expected.  Like the original better</li>
    <li> A lot like Chap Stick. Probably won&#x27;t reorder. I need a more concentrated lip moisturizer. It&#x27;s just ok, but not high end product.</li>
    <li> While I was in a drug store one day several weeks ago, I decided to buy this lip balm because the package said it was \\&quot;ultra conditioning\\&quot; and my lips always need extra moisturizing.  After using this for a couple of weeks, I would never purchase this again.  At first it appeared to \\&quot;ultra moisturize\\&quot; because it glides on easily and feels like I put a light coat of Vaseline or butter on my lips.  However, the end result is that the moisturizing effect is an illusion because after a few uses, my lips became more chapped than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product.  I would not buy this lip balm again. Perhaps I&#x27;m allergic to the Kokum Butter although the product says hypoallergenic. However, after reading the other reviews, it appears many others have had the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE November 23, 2013 - I had contacted Burt&#x27;s Bees on November 19 shortly after I wrote this review to ask them if they would replace this product with another one. They offered to replace this chapstick with their beeswax lip balm that has vitamin E and peppermint in it.  I got that lip balm today. It has a nice flavor and there&#x27;s a tingly sensation to the balm that I like.  I will update this note after I&#x27;ve tried it for about 2 weeks to see if I have any bad reaction.  In summary, their customer service is 5 stars and if this lip balm works for me, then I&#x27;d puchase their products again except I would avoid anything with Kokum Butter in it because it has a very drying affect on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE December 4, 2013 - I&#x27;ve used the replacement stick (Burt&#x27;s Bees Classic Beeswax Lip Balm with Vitamin E and Peppermint) for the past couple of weeks and it works well.  I like it almost as much as my Chapstick, although Chapstick feels slightly more moisturizing on my lips.</li>
    <li> Did not buy on Amazon but it makes no difference. Huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, except this one. It&#x27;s soft and feels pretty good when it&#x27;s first put on but seems to be gone in a matter of minutes and makes my lips feel even more chapped.  I&#x27;ve been using it 3 days consistently with no change in how chapped my lips are, I&#x27;ll probably go back to their regular type.</li>
    <li> 4 hours of moisturization? More like 2 minutes, then back to having chapped lips. I was using the Burt&#x27;s Bees blueberry+chocolate lip balm which I was happy with but wanted something that moisturized a little better. Well, despite this being &amp;#34;ultra conditioning&amp;#34; it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as my previous balm. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it went on nicely, but unfortunately only stayed on my lips for a couple minutes and my lips were right back to being dry. Definitely going back to the blueberry+chocolate balm.</li>
    <li> Keeps my puckers moisturized all day long.</li>
    <li> Love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, works really well in the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;I toss in a tube in my shopping cart when I need to get my free shipping quota.</li>
    <li> 👎 I&#x27;m an avid Chapstick brand or Avon chapstick user &amp; I really thought this Chapstick would be better than the orginal Burt&#x27;s Bee (also terrible) but sadly it wasn&#x27;t. My lips returned to being parched within an hour.</li>
    <li> Why is so HARD to find a natural lip balm (that lets your lips breathe, unlike brands like Blistex and Chapstick) that has no fumigatious scent. Made that word up as most balms have a very overpowering perfume scent. Even other Burt&#x27;s Bees have this (Honey, ugh). Very sensitive to scents.  I&#x27;m one of those that the rule against fragrances in a public setting like hospitals were created. Chemical sensitivity, I don&#x27;t mind when people wear a little perfume. It&#x27;s those people who douse themselves with the whole bottle that make me want to throw up. Same with lip balm, as my nose is the closest to smell my lips. This has no smell and no taste. I&#x27;m one of those that has a lip balm in most every location. One next to me, near my computer, in my chest bag, in a jacket or shirt pocket, next to my bed. I&#x27;d keep one in every room if I could. And whenever I go to a store that has it, I buy a tube or two and stock up. IN CASE they ever discontinue this (non) scent. It has a tiny scent, barely noticeable. And as natural lip balms, this has never made my lips peel the way Blistex would always do. When you accidentally peel too much skin and it bleeds, making one prone to blisters. You know the routine. I also suffer from dry mouth and constant dry lips, so this helps with retaining moisture so my lips don&#x27;t crack and bleed. Highly recommend this product !!</li>
    <li> I have different Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balms but this one is my favorite. It goes on very smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> The people at Burt&#x27;s Bees should be ashamed for producing a product like this. It is compared to cigarettes because there has to be something in there that makes your lips even more chapped once you stop using it for more than a couple hours! There are 27 ingredients in this product, something isn&#x27;t right with this and I recommend that people stay far away from it. I&#x27;ve already called Burt&#x27;s and requested a full refund for this overpriced product. I am now weary of everything else they come out with and will most likely think twice before buying anything else they make.</li>
    <li> I see what others are talking about. I was prepared for this to be slick by other reviews and definitely had the experience of it not lasting long. It smells good and I just use it at night because if I used it during the day, I&#x27;d be re-applying once per hour after it wore off and left my lips feeling dry. I guess at night I&#x27;m not constantly pressed my lips together, so it doesn&#x27;t wear off as quickly.</li>
    <li> The lip balm is fine but there&#x27;s some false advertising on the Amazon site. When you click on the product it comes up with the product name and states that it is a 2 pack. I only received on container, so I checked more on the description down below and it say s one. The description in larger print was misleading.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because for the brief moment it touched my lips, it was pretty smooth. That being said, it had an overwhelming smell, it was not unlike baby wipes. Having something chemical/perfumed smelling on my lips was a no go, and I immediately wiped it off. I bought a 2 pack at CVS. I had really hoped this was completely unscented or a light, sweet smell. I wish there was a way to test burt&#x27;s bees or a scratch and sniff patch on their products because often I end up with a product that I just don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ll stick to the regular stuff.</li>
    <li> Horrible flavor taste as if it were expired</li>
    <li> This product is oily, which makes it glide on easily. However, its very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t keep my lips moisturized for long enough. The taste is also worth mentioning, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this but stating I am a lip chewer, When I&#x27;m nervous or bored I just cannot help myself so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something to heal and moisturize my lips without having a. terrible taste. There is not a noticeable taste to the balm but I do find that I need to reapply about every hour - due to my nervous habit. I&#x27;m sure for someone who does not do this they wouldn&#x27;t have a problem but for me it was not the best other than I&#x27;m glad my lips don&#x27;t smell or taste like Blistex of which my BF is most grateful. I would tentatively recommend this product if you don&#x27;t demand a lot from your lip balm.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this lip balm from Amazon, but I wanted to let my opinion out. This lip balm saved my life... literally. I have always been using regular chapstick, Blistex, Vaseline, Vaseline in a tube, Mary Kay lip balm, and Carmex. None of those worked like this. I had to rely on each of them every 10 minutes and my lips were still peeling and burning. I couldn&#x27;t wear lipstick or even lip gloss. I bought this at my local Walmart and I&#x27;m glad I did. It was the best decision I ever did. I put this on only once a day and it has cured my lips from peeling, burning, and chapping. My lips are smooth all day and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier! If you&#x27;re like me and have tried everything, do give this a try! Maybe you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
    <li> This glides on really smoothly, and then my lips feel strangely dry in less than 20 minutes. It feels like it just doesn&#x27;t absorb. I use other Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products like the tinted lip balms (which are excellent) and the beeswax lip balm with peppermint (pretty standard chapstick, gets the job done), so this kokum butter lip balm baffles me as to how it is still being made. Go for any other Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chapstick, not this random one!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. Lip balm really works well.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this lip balm.  Conditions and keeps my lips moisturized and soft.  More convenient than the one that comes in a tube.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite chapstick. Some are too waxy and a lot of them will actually make me break out in hives, so this hypoallergenic Burt&#x27;s Bees is my #1 go to for lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It is nothing special. I felt it left my lips creamy after I put it on which helped my lips fell moisturized. After 15 mins the creamy feeling was gone and my lips felt dry again. It didn&#x27;t hurt my lips or cause a reaction. I would not purchase this again. Normally Burt&#x27;s Bees is my preferred chap-stick but I felt different about it this time. Will not purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees again until new products come out. I would not recommend this, but like I said it won&#x27;t harm you or help you.</li>
    <li> Great lip conditioner.</li>
    <li> The best lip conditioner and so safe!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm.  It puts a shiny shimmer on your lips like lip gloss, great over or under lipstick.</li>
    <li> Glides on smooth. Last for two hours not four. Does not condition. Not as good as the other Burt&#x27;s chap sticks and more expensive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell, taste and is smooth and silky!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and stopped using the other flavored varieties.</li>
    <li> Adds moisture without stickiness, love it.</li>
    <li> i really love how this looks on my lips..its so shiny but with no nasty stickyness of lip gloss..my lips feel smooth and just all around softer and moisturized now with that being said i have to admit as much as i love this i have to say i wish it would stay on a bit longer..however my lips still feel nice after it rubs off but i love the shine and thats what sadly goes away too fast..but i will still continue to use and deffinitly becuz the price lol</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, as expected from Burt&#x27;s Bees. This new formula extra smooth and may not be available everywhere!! Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> This is probably the best of all the Burt&#x27;s lip stick lines.  I also use the tube.  These products are excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Like Burts bees lip balm...the kokum butter does taste different. It is not offensive but is definitely bb quality. Keeps my lips very soft but seems to absorb very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this...hard to find in stores now. Great for fragrance sensitive users.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried lots and lots of lip balms.  We avoid anything with parabens and the problem with most in this category is that they get too soft and melt in your car.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  It stays like new.  Works great, keeps our lips moisturized and has no bad flavor or smell.  We keep one on our nightstand, in my wife&#x27;s purse, on the counter, and in each car.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good to meet my expectation. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips soft and smooth! It doesn&#x27;t have much flavor or odor, but it works great on chapped lips.</li>
    <li> The other burt bees chapstick sometimes burns my lips, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  I love it, def. more moisturizing on my lips.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very conditioning.</li>
    <li> I was a nursing mother, i believe this brand. it&#x27;s a very good product for me ,i like it very much.</li>
    <li> One of the better hypoallergenic lip balns on the market ar a reasonable price for frequent users.  An application only stays on for a few hours.  So let&#x27;s get started I noticed that many women put up with lip and mouth pain, blisters, even burning tongues and red blotches, and allergic perfumes - all  because they want aboyfriend to find you sexy.spoint&lt;br /&gt;want plump, pouty lipthatand taste/smell good. If you use a lplumper or balm with little success, twenty to one you have a contact allergy to an ingredientingredied in the lip product that will become stronger the longer you use it, since your body considers these chemicals-natural or not- as irritants. Ten to one&lt;br /&gt;I have multiple contact allergies to essential oils and therefore for the&lt;br /&gt;leafy greens extract&lt;br /&gt;If you suspect contact allergies, go see your best bud -a dermatologist who can give you a chenicals patch test. This test typically inclides 30-40 items placed as patches on your back and evaluated ove a period of a few days. I am alletgic to Oil of Balsam, a widely found and used multicomponent essential oil whick has a lemony sweet taste. It I found in lemon peel oil, orange peel oil, nutmeg, peppers of all types. It is evev used in feminine hygiene products and surgical dressings because of itsnice smell. Of course, it is also in perfumes and dental materials. Another nono for me is cinnamic aldehyde, found in li ptoducts, perfumes, cerals, and bok choy and spinach.</li>
    <li> Use it the morning before I leave the house.  Works very well.  Great conditioner.</li>
    <li> Quick to put on and soothing. I recommend this over the brand &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; any day if your suffer from dry lips.  This isn&#x27;t as greasy as the other brand either. You still will have to look in the mirror to see if you have any left over on the corners of your mouth. So far you can just spread this stick on with one layer and be good to go. Still not so sure about it lasting 4 hours. I will keep trying this product and up date later. You can feel this healing your lips just like the original version of the this Burt&#x27;s Lip Balm.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm I will use now. If you have dry lips, try it. I was addicted to other lip balms containing petroleum products for years. The more I used the more I needed. This lip balm is not like that. Plus, it isn&#x27;t hard like some lip balms so it rolls on nicely.</li>
    <li> This is Burt&#x27;s Bees most moisturizing lip balm, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.  It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> I regret buying this Chapstick . My lips were even more chapped after I kept using it.</li>
    <li> The lip balm was not as conditioning or long-lasting as I would have liked. I have to reapply very frequently.  Other than that, however, it is a good lip balm.</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products a lot and they are really expensive at the department stores. So I bought this one on here and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful, not conditioning or moisturizing in the least bit, and it is true that it seems to make chapped lips even worse.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone getting relief from dry lips from this stuff.  I don&#x27;t believe the positive reviews are real.  They can&#x27;t be, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work!  There is just no replacement for the original Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint lip balm, it has always worked better than anything else.  Every time I get adventurous and try something new, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product goes on very smooth. Nice sheen to it, wish it would last a little longer.  However, it really does feel as smooth as butter!</li>
    <li> Extremely drying, feels good at first but has left my lips drier than ever after using it daily for three weeks.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about a month, but after that (never leaving my coat pocket except during use) it turned to mush and was unusable.</li>
    <li> Glides on smooth, very conditioning, and not waxy like most chapstick -- this is a staple for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Not sticky, and lasts longer than regular chapstick.</li>
    <li> Works very well. It heals my lips where the skin has been peeling off.</li>
    <li> I think I would be less harsh on this product if it weren&#x27;t so expensive, or if it didn&#x27;t come from such an astute company like Burt&#x27;s Bees. It really is quite an unacceptable lip balm for the amount of money I paid for it. I bought it in a pack of two for $7.75 expecting good things and really the only thing it did was dry out my lips. I have to reapply it over and over continuously. It makes my lips flake. It isn&#x27;t the worst lip balm because it does offer mild relief for a while and if you keep using it your lips stay at least somewhat hydrated. But the advertising says its \\&quot;Ultra Conditioning.\\&quot; This is very much false advertising. It last for about 4 minutes, not 4 hours. Based on other reviews, it would seem that it&#x27;s also the LEAST conditioning of all the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I simply cannot recommend buying this product. Your money is better spent elsewhere.</li>
    <li> By far, my favorite lip balm! I seriously keep one in my purse, desk, and by my bed, so I can always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm! It goes on really greasy but absorbs really fast and seems to be perfect for my lips.</li>
    <li> Alway slove Burt Bees Lip Balms</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I added it on a whim so I could fulfill my S&amp;S order for the month and I&#x27;m glad I did. Nice and velvety smooth!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for hydrating, but it doesn&#x27;t really last as long as the original Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm does. It also is a little too greasy and doesn&#x27;t go well under lipstick.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Buy with confidence</li>
    <li> Very good conditioning and moisturizing li[ balm. Very happy.</li>
    <li> So good and can fell honey on my lips</li>
    <li> My husbands says this truly moisturizes and conditions within a few days he&#x27;s noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
    <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm with peppermint, but I wanted to try this for deeper conditioning &amp; also I wanted an option without a flavor.  This Ultra Conditioning Lip Balm gives a nice gloss (probably not great for a guy) but I honestly don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as good as the regular formula with peppermint.  This Ultra stuff doesn&#x27;t last very long on my lips &amp; I find myself needing to reappply too often.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is moisturizing but not lasts long. It only stays for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees Ultra Conditioning Lip Balm with Kokum Butter was a saving grace for me.  I wear lipstick each and every day and typically put lip balm on my lips in the evening.  About three years ago, I had an issue with my lips being so dry that the skin was actually peeling off in thin strips.  In addition, the skin around my lips was so chapped and dry and red and flaky.  It actually hurt and was just awful.  At the time, I had started using a new toothpaste and teeth whitener product and thought perhaps the problem was because of that.  I stopped using the product but was still having the problem.  Knowing that nothing else had changed that would have had such an effect, I started changing my lip balm.  Originally, I used the blue tube of Blistex Complete Moisture Lip Balm.  I stopped using this and literally went through everything:  Neutrogena, Chapstick, other types of Blistex, Carmex, etc.  I was desperate.  Finally, I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I remember stopping by the drug store one morning on my way to work to buy yet another lip balm to try and solve the problem.  I&#x27;ll never forget the cashier looking at me with this strange look on her face.  When I got back in my car, I realized why she was looking at me so strangely.  There was a huge piece of dry skin that had peeled up on my lip.  While I tried pretty much all of the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balms, this one was the cure.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees for this product.  Needless to say, I buy it in lots, use it each and every day, and it has worked wonders for me.  My lips and skin have been restored.  I know that Burt&#x27;s Bees has a history of ceasing the production of some products.  I hope that this won&#x27;t be one of them.  If you&#x27;re having any of the symptoms indicated above, I would definitely recommend this product.  It is smooth and silky and glides on the lips.  It is not a waxy product that you have to drag along the lips to apply, which can be painful if you have issues with dry, cracked lips.  I just love this product.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this as an upgrade from classic burts bees. It feels amazing when you first apply it but the moisturizing effect doesn&#x27;t last very long, definitely a lot shorter than the classic burts bees. Overall would not recommend unless you want to use it every 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even really give this one star. Maybe half. It&#x27;s light, smells wonderful...but I must be allergic to the Kokum Butter. My lips were so dry after 4 uses that my lip actually BUSTED while eating. Yeah..it was that bad. And this was two days after the last use. Use at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Bought this as lip balm (obviously), but it ended up saving me as a skin protectant. On a trip, I wore a brand new fancy top I hadn&#x27;t tried before. Big mistake: the fabric ended up rubbing bad friction burns (&amp;#34;rug burns&amp;#34;) on the underside of both of my upper arms before I could finally change out of it. Didn&#x27;t really have access to a store to get something to treat it for several days, but my wife suggested trying this on it. It soothed the red skin, kept it moisturized, and four days later when I could put something &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; on it, it was healed enough I didn&#x27;t need to. If it did that much for skin that chapped and irritated, I can only imagine how great it will be for my lips!</li>
    <li> Not bad.  It glides on and it&#x27;s smooth but man does it smell! If you&#x27;ve ever smelled a citronella candle or bug spray that&#x27;s exactly what this is like.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell it&#x27;s a good lip balm.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lip balm.  It&#x27;s very smooth...glides right onto your lips.  I had been using another lip gloss for years before it was discontinued.  I tried about 10 different types of gloss to replace my old standby.  My lips were a mess with cracking, peeling due to other balms (including some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees).  Then I tried this one.  I&#x27;m very pleased now.  The only caution is this lip balm doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen.</li>
    <li> kokum butter. it goes on very smooth and it feels nice on my lips BUT there&#x27;s not much of a flavor or sent. I love the pink grapefruit one the best still.</li>
    <li> favorite chapstick. No spf on it, but thats okay with me.</li>
    <li> Extremely oily. Pretty gross.</li>
    <li> My all time Favorite lip balm, of any lip balms and of the Burts bees line also!! This one is light weight and moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent or flavor. It&#x27;s just a nice solid lip balm that soothe very dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;I try not to ever do with out one of the Burts Bees lip balm in my&lt;br /&gt;Purse; they&#x27;re all nice. This one&#x27;s just my all time fav!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love...&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lip balm!!!&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy it at my local walgreens or other local stores.</li>
    <li> This is one of those oily lip balms (as opposed to the burts bees original Beeswax Lip Balm).  Even though this has kokum, cocoa, and shea butter it is still pretty greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why these oily ones don&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m a big oil user; I don&#x27;t use any conventional body or facial moisturizers, only coconut oil (including oil based soaps and shampoo bars w/ limited ingredients).  My lips are the opposite, my lips want something thick and heavy; chagrin valley&#x27;s three butters lotion bar works when I&#x27;m at home but I need something else to stick in my pockets for work/ going out.  My lips are dry and almost always have some dried skin that&#x27;s begging to be peeled off. (gross, i know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you understand what I mean and don&#x27;t like using oil lip balms, stick to the beeswax lip balm from Burt&#x27;s.  Also this melts quickly.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees as a company, but their other lip balm wasn&#x27;t doing it for me. While I think their traditional lip balm is great for protecting against wind, it&#x27;s not good at moisturizing. The Ultra Conditioning Burt&#x27;s Bees protects and conditions. It&#x27;s loaded with moisture and keeps your lips feeling soft. It&#x27;s lightweight, and not thick and waxy like the other lip balm they sell. I wear it over my lipstick all of the time. It works well to protect against chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the lovely herbal smell that you may be used to with traditional Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, which is the only bad thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a newer product, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to find in stores. If you buy it on Amazon it&#x27;s about the same price with shipping. This seller shipped fast, I had it in two days.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s moisturing, but not long-lasting, you have to apply every two or three hours.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using the Nivea lip balm, the Bee is not better.&lt;br /&gt;so still I have to look for some others .</li>
    <li> My lips enjoy this very much.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lipbalm. It goes on nice and smooth, not shiny like lip gloss. It keeps my lips moisturized and it smells good!</li>
    <li> 4 hours? More like 4 minutes, this is really oily, and tastes weird. I can use it for daily quick moisturizes, but I think Burts original is better.</li>
    <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and it was a great success! He usually doesn&#x27;t like lip balm because its scented or smells girly, and the ones he does like...I don&#x27;t. This one is perfect. He loved it from the beginning and when I kiss him I don&#x27;t get that bite that some of the super menthol ones have. Great neutral lip balm!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry weather! I only need to apply twice a day.</li>
    <li> Literally the worst lip balm ever. It only dried out my lips. Terrible.</li>
    <li> The one thing chap stick should do is moisturize your lips. That&#x27;s it. Everything else - the scent, the packaging, the ingredients - is filler. This product is crappy why? Because it sucks and fails at the one thing it needs to do. It may smell nice and look nice but it doesn&#x27;t bloody work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees. This one sucks. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Got this for the wife, and she likes this stuff better than her &amp;#34;EOS Lip Ball&amp;#34; which is apparently a LOT more expensive.  She&#x27;s a tough critic, so the combination of her satisfaction and the price makes this an easy recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Lip Balm goes, you could say this stuff is &amp;#34;The Bees Knees&amp;#34;!  (Sorry, lame joke... I just couldn&#x27;t resist!)</li>
