    <li> Have used the product before.  This is a resupply.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any improvement to my face after using the product nightly for a month.  I can get the same results from a less expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I love these products and will continue to use them forever.</li>
    <li> I am used to retinol products that practically eat holes in my face.  Well, that&#x27;s not too good -- but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all.</li>
    <li> After 50, ROC rocks!!!</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product  do not think it works as fast as they say tho</li>
    <li> I use this every day before putting on their moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was so sad that I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.  I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, but I am very sensitive with perfume and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;It says that it is allergy free, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The 2 times I used it my skin was very smooth and silky</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  Noticed a difference in my my skin almost immediately.  I will be 41 in a week and noticed my laugh lines and lines above my upper lip were deep.  This product has diminished them noticeably.  There is a fragrance with the product so if you are sensitive to smells I would not recommend.  I love the smell of it, it reminded my husband of a sunscreen smell.  To me it is a floral smell but it diminishes.  I have sensitive combination skin and I have not noticed any irritation or breakouts from the product.  My skin looks more radiant and the deep lines are starting to disappear.  I plan on using this product forever.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  It seems to make a difference</li>
    <li> Wish these products had worked.  I saw no difference, though to be honest, I&#x27;ve been using a bargain retinol cream for some time, so maybe I already achieved any possible improvement.  Both products have a nice texture, and are easy to rub in.  No greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Roc is one of the few products that actually works</li>
    <li> One of the tubes was unsealed.....will be returning to be replaced hopefully it doesn&#x27;t take 10 days to ship.</li>
    <li> The product is no better than my neutrogena moisturizing cream. The packaging is far too small and the results not as visible.</li>
    <li> Have only begun using this RoC product and I can already see results in my skin texture and clarity.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an anti-aging product that really does work!:-)</li>
    <li> After using this product for about a month..... a friend of mine remarked how good my skin looked.  Are you doing something different, she asked??  I love it.  I am 60+ and have tried many different facial creams/lotions..... this is the best!!  ;)</li>
