    <li> it is gentle on gum .. good for those with gums problems such as bleeding</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product. Five Stars Works great!!!</li>
    <li> I chose the Oral B after reading reviews about another brand not sealing the the water and spit contents completely out when brushing. Who wants to inhale that? I really liked this toothbrush.  However, I started using the flossing brushes with it and was told by the dentist that that gives it a very strong stroke. That means that over time, it can actually contribute to wearing away your enamel. They do have a very soft brush which I will go back to. I think it is well over a year old now. No problems.  The battery lasts well. They are a good price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works and fits great.  Also, well priced!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Much softer than the brushes that came with the oral B toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The items arrived as they were indicated.  I was a bit nervous because of the warnings that these are fraudulent replacement heads, but if they are, I cannot tell.  They look exactly like what I would buy in the store (based on a comparison of the packaging and contents), so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Seems softer than toothbrushes for babies. A gift from my dentist for use post-gum surgery. Did not damage surgical area (still have to be CAREFUL). Have graduated to slightly firmer now for more effective cleaning, but I sanitize this one and keep it around just in case. Have not seen this in stores.</li>
    <li> works very well with my machine!</li>
    <li> the amazon price for these compares better than anywhere retail I&#x27;ve found - and thank you very much for the coupon!</li>
    <li> Love these. They are nice and soft and don&#x27;t feel like you are scrubbing your gums away like the standard ones. Wish I could find them in the stores but if you have a prime account it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just got a good report from my dentist.  so something must be going right!</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These brush heads were exactly what I needed and weren&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and it does not have hurt to my gum.&lt;br /&gt;Usual tooth brush sometimes make my gum hurts but this is not.</li>
    <li> oops this isnt muscle rub... don&#x27;t write reviews at 3am.... anyways it is a good toothbrush for people with sensitive teeth.. i think this is the sensitive tooth heads i got for Mom.</li>
    <li> I gave it only 4 stars because this was the only way I could post a review. I bought this kind of brush just in case but I have not used it so far. I am sure it is also excellent though.</li>
    <li> Fits my electric toothbrush and does a good job</li>
    <li> Cleans well and is gentle on your gums.</li>
