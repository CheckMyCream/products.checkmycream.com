### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Just very, very happy with this lipstick!!!</li>
      <li>These are the best drugstore lipsticks that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The shade is very beautiful ..</li>
      <li>This is a very bright, what some call \\&quot;Barbie,\\&quot; pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price for an awesome product.</li>
      <li>This color is beautiful</li>
      <li>I think the color is very bright, very suitable for my work, the use of good feeling mood!</li>
      <li>Great plus for me at this price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>Of course I love Maybelline, Great buy!</li>
      <li>I of course have to purchase a lot of them as manufacturers alway discontinue a good thing.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to put a lot on to get a good color, and</li>
      <li>LOVED it.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick so amazing and bright!</li>
      <li>This is still a saturated, bright, knock-your-socks-off kind of color.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick!</li>
      <li>I just received this lipstick in the mail today, and I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best lipstciks (cost effective) wise that i have purchased.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m the kind of girl who likes to take chances SOMETIMES when it comes to make up, if the mood strikes</li>
      <li>The color is really nice and vibrant and the pigmentation is amazing, it has a kinda fruty smell, but it&#x27;s ok, an excellent product at a really good price.</li>
      <li>the texture is very nice n light ...</li>
      <li>Very cheap.</li>
      <li>It is more of a pink-purple.</li>
      <li>In daylight, this color is stunning.</li>
      <li>This is great for that--and the texture is nice, my lips felt soft using it, and I love the casing.</li>
      <li>I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Kinda over the top,</li>
      <li>mode\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best shade for my medium Italian skin, but ....</li>
      <li>This has got to be one of my favorite lipsticks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is also not too drying, though you may still want to put lip balm under or on top of it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These lipsticks are perfect for spring and give you that extra oomph to your look.</li>
      <li>it should more longlasting ..</li>
      <li>Way too bright for my skin color, but pretty.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vivid Rose: This is a true, bright, pink-red, akin to the petals of a red rose.</li>
      <li>color is gorgeous, it&#x27;s very opaque</li>
      <li>But, I felt amazing after putting this one as it kept my lips moisturized pretty well.</li>
      <li>Also, I won&#x27;t even consider purchasing a lipstick that I can&#x27;t take the top off in the store to see the true color and this one I could.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite color of the collection, and it is a true, blue-based purple.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful color and dont smudge and last for hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 28, and have no visible fine lines around my lips, but the color does migrate.</li>
      <li>The texture of the lipstick is really smooth, and not sticky at all...</li>
      <li>This line of lipsticks is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>That was really important for me because i dont carry around lipgloss to often that i can pop over my lip sticks.</li>
      <li>This item is so great that I ordered another one in a different color.</li>
      <li>People are raving about it, so just had to have it for cheap...</li>
      <li>However, I think a good clear liner might remedy this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own Vibrant Mandarin because I have a high-end lipstick that it is a dupe for, but if I didn&#x27;t have a duplicate, I&#x27;d order that one too.  </li>
      <li>This is my new most favorite lip color.</li>
      <li>They have a lot of colors to match different skin, super happy with this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the color does last, which is nice, as you won&#x27;t have to reapply often (which would require a mirror with this color!)</li>
      <li>Be aware that you should not order most add-ons offered at point of sale.</li>
      <li>Each one is just as good as the next color, i really cant pick a favorite.</li>
      <li>like maybellline 14 hrs super stay lipsticks</li>
      <li>This shade is just one step away from neon, but I think that it&#x27;s still a very pretty spring color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lasts long and looks good.</li>
      <li>I have always been a red lip kinda girl, then i saw girls wearing these bright colored pink lips and fell in love!</li>
      <li>It stays put and is the right color for me.  </li>
      <li>These are surprisingly wearable even though they are bold shades, they are comfortable to wear and ridiculously inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>a decent time,&lt;br /&gt;Color look rich and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price.</li>
      <li>This color is simply gorgeous on my pale slightly golden skin.</li>
      <li>However, I played around with some glosses and was able to make it pretty enough.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m going to buy more of these for the future.  </li>
      <li>As much as I love this color though, it does tend to bleed in the Cupid&#x27;s bow of my upper lip.</li>
      <li>Electric Fuchsia is perhaps a tiny bit darker and more blue-based than Fuchsia Flash.</li>
      <li>For a light shade, this has a considerable amount of punch to it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Brazen Berry: The only word I have for this is LOVE.</li>
      <li>The texture is ok, but slightly dry, however, it stays on pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Its an amazing color for my dark skin.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain too much, as I specifically bought this as an experimentation with color.</li>
      <li>They are longwearing, and are very creamy, with an almost balm-like feel.</li>
      <li>: This is an almost day-glo coral that leans more pink than orange.</li>
      <li>It glides on nicely - very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The color you see on this website is lighter than the real lipstick by a couple of shades.  </li>
      <li>thanks again Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hot coral pink, very pretty!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a true hot pink.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this lipstick.</li>
      <li>When it fades it leaves a gorgeous stain behind.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my mother plus like to try something new out.</li>
      <li>I even saw swatches where they looked exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>I started with Vivid Rose and fell in love, then quickly purchased Infra-Red, Fuschia Flash, and Shocking Coral.  </li>
      <li>I have every color of these vivid lipsticks and have no regrets.</li>
      <li>I own these in Pink Pop, Shocking Coral, Electric Fuchsia (LE), Vivid Rose, Hot Plum, and Brazen Berry.</li>
      <li>and it really irritates me if lipstick leaves a dry feel.</li>
      <li>Pop: A very opaque and white-based bubblegum pink.</li>
      <li>My only problem is that it feathers a bit (unless it&#x27;s just my lips) but nothing that cant be fixed.</li>
      <li>This is a statement-lip kind of shade, and not for the faint of heart.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve  wanted a coral for a while but other corals are always too light and not bold enough.</li>
      <li>It really does have brighter pigments than any other lipsticks I have ever used!</li>
      <li>This is a very nice shade, and because of its pink lean, it would perhaps be less scary to those that are hesitant to try a purple lip.&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;Electric Fuchsia (LE): I actually ordered the shade Fuchsia Flash, but I received the limited edition shade Electric Fuchsia.</li>
<li> It has a formulation that is a little sheerer than the other colors, but it is very buildable.</li>
<li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> course you will always get some fade, or rubbing off from any lipstick you buy, but this one stays on for a very long time.  </li>
<li> I have extremely dry lips, but these are so moisturizing that I can wear them with no problems.</li>
<li> They look so georgous on, and even though they become matte over time they dont dry out.</li>
<li> The product made my wife&#x27;s lips dry out.</li>
<li> I was constantly told my lipstick is too dark.  </li>
<li> have very dry skin</li>

    <li> This color is beautiful</li>
    <li> I think the color is very bright, very suitable for my work, the use of good feeling mood!</li>
    <li> Its an amazing color for my dark skin. I will be wearing it a lot during the summer.</li>
    <li> The lip gloss was twisted out and broken. The product made my wife&#x27;s lips dry out. We would reccend or buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVED it. But, Shocking coral looks more pinkish.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged in boring plastic casing as shown.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and it really irritates me if lipstick leaves a dry feel. But, I felt amazing after putting this one as it kept my lips moisturized pretty well. Great plus for me at this price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;Last a decent time,&lt;br /&gt;Color look rich and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother plus like to try something new out.It is a beautiful color and dont smudge and last for hours.Will defienttly purchased again and get  one for myself....shipping was greatttt</li>
    <li> The shade is very beautiful ..n..the texture is very nice n light ...it should more longlasting ..like maybellline 14 hrs super stay lipsticks</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best lipstciks (cost effective) wise that i have purchased. My only problem is that it feathers a bit (unless it&#x27;s just my lips) but nothing that cant be fixed.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain too much, as I specifically bought this as an experimentation with color. This is great for that--and the texture is nice, my lips felt soft using it, and I love the casing. My only complaint is that my coffee mug looked like it made out with Dr. Frank-N-Furter, and it did smudge a bit on days that I wasn&#x27;t drinking coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the color does last, which is nice, as you won&#x27;t have to reapply often (which would require a mirror with this color!)</li>
    <li> I ordered this in Shocking Coral after reading it was an exact duplicate of another brand&#x27;s limited edition color that I missed out on.  I even saw swatches where they looked exactly the same.  When I received this, I was very disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t coral at all.  It&#x27;s a true hot pink.  Not one hint of orange.  I am not sure whether the consistency from one batch to another is bad or if I&#x27;m blind, but I don&#x27;t know how they could refer to this as coral.  The texture is ok, but slightly dry, however, it stays on pretty well.  At least I didn&#x27;t waste a bunch of money, I guess.</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of my favorite lipsticks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is gorgeous, it&#x27;s very opaque so you don&#x27;t have to put a lot on to get a good color, and it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;Of course you will always get some fade, or rubbing off from any lipstick you buy, but this one stays on for a very long time.  it almost acts as a lip stain as well.  It&#x27;s got a creamy consistency which makes putting it on a snap.  It is also not too drying, though you may still want to put lip balm under or on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this lipstick for anyone!  Great price for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have a serious obsession with the Maybelline Vivids lipsticks. I own these in Pink Pop, Shocking Coral, Electric Fuchsia (LE), Vivid Rose, Hot Plum, and Brazen Berry. These are the best drugstore lipsticks that I have ever used. They are longwearing, and are very creamy, with an almost balm-like feel. I have extremely dry lips, but these are so moisturizing that I can wear them with no problems. All of the shades have a shiny, cream finish, with no shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shades are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink Pop: A very opaque and white-based bubblegum pink. I don&#x27;t find that it goes on streaky, however, in spite of the color. For a light shade, this has a considerable amount of punch to it. This color is my second favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shocking Coral: This is an almost day-glo coral that leans more pink than orange. This shade is just one step away from neon, but I think that it&#x27;s still a very pretty spring color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric Fuchsia (LE): I actually ordered the shade Fuchsia Flash, but I received the limited edition shade Electric Fuchsia. The difference between the two colors is almost imperceptible, so I kept it. Electric Fuchsia is perhaps a tiny bit darker and more blue-based than Fuchsia Flash. This is a very bright, what some call \\&quot;Barbie,\\&quot; pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivid Rose: This is a true, bright, pink-red, akin to the petals of a red rose. I find this shade to be cooler, with a blue base that causes it to lean towards more of a rich, deep pink than red. When I use the word deep, don&#x27;t mistake that to mean dark. This is still a saturated, bright, knock-your-socks-off kind of color. As much as I love this color though, it does tend to bleed in the Cupid&#x27;s bow of my upper lip. I&#x27;m 28, and have no visible fine lines around my lips, but the color does migrate. However, I think a good clear liner might remedy this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Plum: This is a really pretty purple that is slightly warmer than the other purple in this collection. It is more of a pink-purple. This is a very nice shade, and because of its pink lean, it would perhaps be less scary to those that are hesitant to try a purple lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazen Berry: The only word I have for this is LOVE. This is my favorite color of the collection, and it is a true, blue-based purple. It has a formulation that is a little sheerer than the other colors, but it is very buildable. In daylight, this color is stunning. This is a statement-lip kind of shade, and not for the faint of heart.</li>
    <li> The color is really nice and vibrant and the pigmentation is amazing, it has a kinda fruty smell, but it&#x27;s ok, an excellent product at a really good price.</li>
    <li> This line of lipsticks is fantastic.  The color selection and formula rival lipsticks in my collection that cost 3 times the price.  I started with Vivid Rose and fell in love, then quickly purchased Infra-Red, Fuschia Flash, and Shocking Coral.  I received Violet Intrigue from an amazon order mix-up that I ended up keeping anyway!  I don&#x27;t own Vibrant Mandarin because I have a high-end lipstick that it is a dupe for, but if I didn&#x27;t have a duplicate, I&#x27;d order that one too.  These are surprisingly wearable even though they are bold shades, they are comfortable to wear and ridiculously inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;If you order one and don&#x27;t like it, send it to me!</li>
    <li> I have always been a red lip kinda girl, then i saw girls wearing these bright colored pink lips and fell in love! I have every color of these vivid lipsticks and have no regrets. Each one is just as good as the next color, i really cant pick a favorite. They look so georgous on, and even though they become matte over time they dont dry out. That was really important for me because i dont carry around lipgloss to often that i can pop over my lip sticks. These lipsticks are perfect for spring and give you that extra oomph to your look.</li>
    <li> This is my new most favorite lip color. I&#x27;ve  wanted a coral for a while but other corals are always too light and not bold enough. This lasts long and looks good. $5 for this lipstick isn&#x27;t bad either. They have a lot of colors to match different skin, super happy with this.</li>
    <li> Way too bright for my skin color, but pretty.</li>
    <li> I was constantly told my lipstick is too dark.  It&#x27;s called vulcano something.  Anyway, I was looking for a lighter brighter lipstick and this fits the bill.  I of course have to purchase a lot of them as manufacturers alway discontinue a good thing.  It stays put and is the right color for me.  Also, I won&#x27;t even consider purchasing a lipstick that I can&#x27;t take the top off in the store to see the true color and this one I could.  So, I&#x27;m going to buy more of these for the future.  FYI:  The color you see on this website is lighter than the real lipstick by a couple of shades.  Highly recommend this lipstick.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick! Of course I love Maybelline, Great buy!</li>
    <li> This color is simply gorgeous on my pale slightly golden skin. And it lasts quite a while. When it fades it leaves a gorgeous stain behind. I like to wear this thinly patted on for everyday or thick for night.</li>
    <li> This on my lips doesn&#x27;t even remotely resemble what it looks like in the tube. It&#x27;s fuchsia on my lips, like something I&#x27;d wear as a child simply because it&#x27;s obnoxious. However, I played around with some glosses and was able to make it pretty enough. It glides on nicely - very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Hot coral pink, very pretty!</li>
    <li> Be aware that you should not order most add-ons offered at point of sale. They are usually of inferior quality that the distributor sells to an impulsive buyer. This lipstick is like something parents would buy for children as part of a Halloween make-up kit. It smells like bubblegum and goes on like chalk. Very cheap. I can&#x27;t even return it, since I had to open it to use it. Not resalable. Awful.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick so amazing and bright! I can&#x27;t wait for the summer to use shocking coral. I am def considering buying different colors.</li>
    <li> Too pink, not a true coral.</li>
    <li> GOD allmighty! I bought this one in Shocking Coral because of a youtube vid...or vids many of those. People are raving about it, so just had to have it for cheap...thanks again Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s...yeah....shocking.Kinda over the top, but I&#x27;m the kind of girl who likes to take chances SOMETIMES when it comes to make up, if the mood strikes and I get in the \\&quot;rebel mode\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best shade for my medium Italian skin, but ....heck...I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;The Vivids collection: I want them ALL!</li>
    <li> I just received this lipstick in the mail today, and I LOVE it! I chose the color Shocking Coral. It really does have brighter pigments than any other lipsticks I have ever used! This item is so great that I ordered another one in a different color. The texture of the lipstick is really smooth, and not sticky at all...and it lasts a long time. Just very, very happy with this lipstick!!!</li>
