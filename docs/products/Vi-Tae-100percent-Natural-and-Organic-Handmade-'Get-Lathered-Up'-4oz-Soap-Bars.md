<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this soap! My skin feels great! Very refreshing! Would definitely recommend purchasing!!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soft. Has a mild fragrance. Very clean smelling and feel. I haven&#x27;t had it but about a week and so far very pleased with the soap. My daughter is using hers and likes it as well.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It came well packaged and the build quality is outstanding. The item description was right on. We will use this everyday and I&#x27;m about to buy some more. Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s favorite soap........great smell to start the day with, I would like to try more of your products.</li>
    <li> Great high lather vitamin c soap.  Smells delish and it is well packaged.  Could be used as a gift in a gift basket</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> First of all I do not have sensitive skin. I wanted to give this a try because I do love organic soaps. After using his soap, my skin did feel softer and smoother, but, so do the other soaps I use. My main problem with this soap, was I started to seriously itch after using it. Especially under my arms and around my private areas. I would re-rinse several times and the itching still continued. I had to stop using this product and went back to my coconut cream soap. Also, I would like to say, this soap does not last very long.</li>
    <li> USING THIS SOAP MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> Love this soap....Will buy again, and again:) Leaves my face so moist, seeing results.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells Good and Feels Good to the Skin !</li>
    <li> I did use the soap The Lathered Up Soap and I liked it. It is one of the first soaps I have found that I&#x27;m able to use on my face. I would tell people to use this.  I can&#x27;t tell if it has a smell because I can&#x27;t smell, but it lathers real nice and I like that. I would give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Smells like oranges and lathers nicely...vitamin C is a big plus!</li>
    <li> Skin looks healthy all ready after one week use!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for a few days now and my skin feels soft. I love the smell, the lather... I just love this soap, no health bar.</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review for the VItamin C Soap! This soap smells wonderful, lathers great and my skin was so soft! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?asin&#x3D;B00TKI25SS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used  both products for the past two weeks, in the morning and again at night,&lt;br /&gt;so far to date have not noticed any changes</li>
    <li> makes my skin dry.....</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap.  Luxury plus and worth the money! Will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Certified Organic Aromatherapy Herbal Bar Soap its all natural ingredients that&#x27;s why its really good for skin its reduce my acne and my skin start glowing. I damage my skin for too much acne and since I started using this product its also faded the scars of my acne. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>

    <li> I love how this soap lathers up and the smell is amazing! My skin is so soft and silky! I will be buying this soap again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely have fallen in love with this soap! I am allergic to a lot of things skin care related so I am sometimes a tad nervous to try new products. I had absolutely no issues with this soap at all. I really like the citrusy scent from the soap. It is subtle and not overpowering. I don&#x27;t feel like I have residue stuck on my skin after I shower and my skin wasn&#x27;t dry either.</li>
    <li> Seems nice. Too early to know total effects.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. I love how soft it makes your skin feel.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it! It lathers so well and makes my skin feel nourished and soft! Vi-Tae is a great company!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels fresh. Skin feels clean and clear.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome.  Thank you for allowing me to purchase this at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. It is certified organic which is very important to me.  It lathers really well and leaves my skin felling very soft.  It has a nice citrus smell and I love using it even on my face. It also lasts for a long time.  I thought after a week it would pretty much be gone but I still have half a bar and I sometimes use it twice a day.  I will definitely purchase more.  Some for me and some for gifts.</li>
    <li> It does not leave my face feeling dry...and I like the smell of it....great product!</li>
    <li> very nice soap I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it alot!!  Made my skin feel really soft ...</li>

    <li> I have been using this soap for about a week and can&#x27;t believe the difference it&#x27;s made already!  My skin is softer, fine lines less noticeable and even my pores look better!  Finally a skin product I can rave about!!!  I am definitely hooked!</li>
    <li> Wow! Use this and you feel so clean.Not like you still have soap on you! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The best soap ever with vitamin C,</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this years ago - leaves skin sooo soft and the lather is awesome. Special packaging - will share this new find with friends.</li>
    <li> While this soap is very nice, I still prefer the goat milk soap that I purchase locally.  I might purchase again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It smells great but it does make my face feel dry after I use it.  Not giving up on it yet!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap! Will order again, love the lather and the scent!!</li>
    <li> LOve this soap. It lathers up nicely and my skin feels great. I just stared using it and already feel an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Ia m very pleased with this product.  It made my skin feel very soft and refreshed.  I will be using it again.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  It gets a great lather unlike other all natural soaps and leaves my skin feeling soft.  Will definitely buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this soap.</li>
    <li> Soap feels great and works well.</li>
    <li> I suffer from allergic dermatitis and this soap has helped my hands tremendously, so much so, that I purchased another bar to put in the shower to see what it can do for the rest of my skin!</li>
    <li> My face has not felt soooo nice and soft in years.  I must look silly to family ad friends as I go to all and say &amp;#34;Feel how soft my face is!&amp;#34;  You have to try it, you will LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> i have used a few times but not every day. it smells great. i am liking it alot.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap! leaves skin soft, supple, and absolutely touchable. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this vitamin c soap! My skin looks stunning! It is so soft and feels so clean! I usually hate using bar soap because of the &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; feel it leaves, but this soap is different. It&#x27;s pure and natural which is why I love it so much! It&#x27;s hard to find great skincare products that are good for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved this product in return for an honest review</li>
    <li> Love these soaps!  We received the first at a promotional price to sample and review.  The scent is so nice and refreshing.  Organic and natural ingredients, vegan, and no chemicals.  The soap lathers up nicely, and you come out feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great! I own the vitamin c soap and the oatmeal spice soap, and they both smell AMAZING! I absolutely love bath and body products, so of course good smelling soaps are a YES PLEASE! These smell fantastic..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their soap, which is now mine, lathers up nicely and goes on feeling so so soothing. I suffer from dermatitis and this soap REALLY helps sooth the itching and irritation associated with it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all either, and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lovely aroma lingers on my skin and makes me feel fabulous. Highly recommend. (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> nice scent and lathers great..love the way it makes my skin feel..and the vitamin c so good for your skin..great product..</li>
    <li> Love the way that my skin feels after using this soap, will tell others about this product. going to check out other products made by Vi tae.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Skin is soft.  Rinses off easy and I don&#x27;t feel like a prune.</li>
    <li> The soap is very sudsy, has no smell and is okay.  I think it is very expensive however and will probably not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Never did I think I would be leaving such a review.  A &amp;#34;suggested post&amp;#34; popped up on my Facebook page for this soap, so curious I checked it out.  First of all, I am a 48 year old female with a forehead of a 16 year old.  I have acne not quite what a teenager has but they are little red bumps that resemble pimples and my forehead gets peppered with them.  My dermatologist has me using a cream that is not completely covered by insurance because if your over 40 years old it&#x27;s considered a wrinkle reducing cream. Anyhow, the cream is very harsh on my forehead, most of the time my forehead looks red and raw. The last three weeks I&#x27;ve had this breakout shall we say and I&#x27;ve been trying to get my forehead cleared up.  So I checked out this soap and the reviews were good almost to good to be true, but I&#x27;ve thrown away more money on less, so I ordered two bars.  I have used it now for 3 days and the results are nothing short of AMAZING!  My forehead is just about cleared of any &amp;#34;pimples&amp;#34;, the redness from using the cream is starting to fade and my face is so soft.  I never thought this vitamin C soap would work so well and so fast, I am very impressed! I&#x27;m so impressed I gave the second bar to my daughter. If you have problem skin you need to try this facial soap. TRY THIS PRODUCT, I DON&#x27;T THINK YOU&#x27;LL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> Very nice soap.  I love it and will order more when the time comes.  Thank you for a beautiful American product.</li>
    <li> Really love this soap.  Really makes you feel clean and refreshed.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> You really must try this Vitamin  C soap by  Vi-Tae.  Really pleased with how clean it makes my skin feel and look.  The smell is very nice and not overwhelming. I am very happy that is made in the USA.  Customer service is excellent.  I am on a fixed income and because the products are somewhat out of my price range I am able to purchase with a deal, promo code or coupon.  Thank you Vi-tae.  Looking forward to trying other products from this great company. :)</li>
    <li> This is excellant. lathers extremely well and live the face soft and smooth. Love it.</li>
