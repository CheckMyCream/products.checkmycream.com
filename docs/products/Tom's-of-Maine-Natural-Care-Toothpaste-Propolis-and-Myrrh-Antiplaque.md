      <li>and then it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>AWESOME!!!</li>
      <li>Read what Dr. Weil has to say about carrageenan and you will understand that it&#x27;s best to avoid it.</li>
      <li>The fennel flavor is great too.</li>
      <li>A great product.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, a pleasant departure from the all too cliché minty flavored toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Good Paste been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a convenient way to buy it.</li>
      <li>My mouth still feels clean and the flavor is really great!</li>
      <li>Not my favorite taste!</li>
      <li>love the taste of fennel.!</li>
      <li>In the meantime I make my own toothpaste with coconut oil, baking soda, and spearmint oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The taste is delightful and the paste cleans very well.</li>
      <li>I am off to search for a truly healthy product.</li>
      <li>Taste great and ;polishes teeth very well.</li>
      <li>I love this as an alternative, when I cannot use fluoride toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Also, the lovely people from Maine sold their product to Colgate and Colgate has ruined the brand by adding fluoride versions.</li>
      <li>Great flavor, kind of like the old Stimorol gum from the olden days.</li>
      <li>Leaves teeth clean and gums feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>Finally found a Fluoride-free formula with a surprising nice taste to it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy using very much!</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>Leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I was drawn to Toms of Maine Propolis &amp; Myrrh in particular because it contains myrrh (a resin known to be beneficial against dental infections, gingivitis and canker sores among many dental ailments); however, it has a gag-worthy flavor.</li>
      <li>Great thing is one small pea-size drop froths up a lot in your mouth, allowing you a lot of toothpaste to brush with.</li>
      <li>Natural, environmentally friendly and not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>As strange as it sounds to use a toothpaste with fennel seeds, I really love this flavor.</li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Love fennel - hard to find around my home</li>
      <li>plus Tom&#x27;s is a natural  product.</li>
      <li>Despite having sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I just wish it were a sensitive formula</li>
      <li>Though this particular toothpaste is without fluoride, the packaging is similar to the company&#x27;s fluoride versions.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to mint and menthol, so my toothpaste options are limited to Tom&#x27;s of Maine and when I saw this new flavor, I had to try it.</li>
      <li>There is not better natural toothpaste, particularly if you are ultra sensative to mint....</li>

<li> My only complaint is that it leaves my mouth dry shortly after using.</li>
<li> and we are past the period where they can be returned, so 40% of my order is a total loss.</li>
<li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Antiplaque Toothpaste with Propolis and Myrrh, Fennel ,5.5 Oz, 2 Count tastes like black licorice.</li>
<li> For those of us who are sensitive to floride,baking soda and artificial colors, this is a God send.</li>
<li> Does not have all the artificial ingredients of regular toothpaste.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is sad that Colgate has decided to degrade Tom&#x27;s.</li>
<li> Whatever Myrrh is, smells like nasty black liquorish.  </li>
<li> Terrible quality product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff, a pleasant departure from the all too cliché minty flavored toothpaste.  Leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I ordered five tubes of Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste.... two of the tubes have simply split open on the sides and are ruined. Terrible quality product and we are past the period where they can be returned, so 40% of my order is a total loss.</li>
    <li> Used to be a fabulous product, but has gone super-commercial and currently contains unhealthy ingredients. I am off to search for a truly healthy product. In the meantime I make my own toothpaste with coconut oil, baking soda, and spearmint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sad that Colgate has decided to degrade Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to Toms of Maine Propolis &amp; Myrrh in particular because it contains myrrh (a resin known to be beneficial against dental infections, gingivitis and canker sores among many dental ailments); however, it has a gag-worthy flavor. Not only did this toothpaste taste GHASTLY, but it contains carrageenan a known carcinogen. Read what Dr. Weil has to say about carrageenan and you will understand that it&#x27;s best to avoid it. Also, the lovely people from Maine sold their product to Colgate and Colgate has ruined the brand by adding fluoride versions. Though this particular toothpaste is without fluoride, the packaging is similar to the company&#x27;s fluoride versions.</li>
    <li> A great product. Natural, environmentally friendly and not tested on animals. The taste is delightful and the paste cleans very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
    <li> There is not better natural toothpaste, particularly if you are ultra sensative to mint....there is no burn.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! Love fennel - hard to find around my home</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste we have found that doesn&#x27;t leave you thirsty after cleaning your teeth.  Great flavor, kind of like the old Stimorol gum from the olden days. I just wish it were a sensitive formula and then it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to find an organic toothpaste without fluoride and without flavors.  Whatever Myrrh is, smells like nasty black liquorish.  Yuck!  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Antiplaque Toothpaste with Propolis and Myrrh, Fennel ,5.5 Oz, 2 Count tastes like black licorice. Not bad. You get use to it. Great thing is one small pea-size drop froths up a lot in your mouth, allowing you a lot of toothpaste to brush with. Lasts long. T.O.M. is a quality company!</li>
    <li> Finally found a Fluoride-free formula with a surprising nice taste to it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy using very much!</li>
    <li> love the taste of fennel.! plus Tom&#x27;s is a natural  product.</li>
    <li> For those of us who are sensitive to floride,baking soda and artificial colors, this is a God send. Taste great and ;polishes teeth very well.</li>

    <li> Been using this toothpaste for years.  Does not have all the artificial ingredients of regular toothpaste.</li>

My mouth still feels clean and the flavor is really great!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste. Despite having sensitive teeth and this doesn&#x27;t claim to deal with this issue, I have had no issue with sensitivity since  starting its use for the last year. My only complaint is that it leaves my mouth dry shortly after using.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite taste!</li>
