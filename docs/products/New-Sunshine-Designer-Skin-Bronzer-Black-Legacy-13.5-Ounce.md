      <li>Nothing will top Obsidian by Designer Skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After buying this product for a friend and her concern that it was counterfeit, I decided to look into it Amazon says it&#x27;s legit but I found the following letter to their customers on the Designer Skin website. So now I don&#x27;t know what to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MESSAGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer&#x27;s Direct Number: 317-554-4760&lt;br /&gt;Fax: 317-554-3449&lt;br /&gt;E-mail: info@designerskin.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 5, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Valued Customers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want to thank you for choosing a professional tanning salon that offers one or more of our products in its salon. For several years, we have followed a salon only distribution policy, which means that our products are prohibited from being sold outside of professional tanning salons or directly to consumers online. We ask for your support in purchasing your lotions from your local salon. You may ask, &amp;#34;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we believe our products produce optimum results when chosen and sold by trained tanning salon professionals who best understand clients&#x27; tanning needs and objectives. These salons professionals are trained by our training staff and will ensure that you get the best product suited for your skin type and tanning needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, products which you may find online are many times counterfeit, contaminated, old or expired products that may not be safe to use. We often receive reports from dissatisfied consumers who have purchased products outside of their professional tanning salon, only to find it to be not genuine. Purchasing lotions from your tanning salon ensures that not only your salon, but the manufacturer, stands behind the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thank you for your support of our brand and your local tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracy Ring&lt;br /&gt;Vice President of U.S. Sales Indoor</li>
    <li> Great color, but not my favorite scent. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not the best smell. Also, I&#x27;d prefer the bottle to be a tube because it would be easier to squeeze, which would also make it easier to use the last of the product while also making it fit easier in your purse. Fix those two things then I&#x27;d give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and we frequently get new lotions that we get to &amp;#34;test drive&amp;#34; before they actually go on the market. Designer Skin always has the best tanning lotions, IMO. I have loved every one that I have tried and this one is no different. First thing that got me was the smell. AMAZING!!! So tropical and fruity/candy-like smelling, makes the whole salon smell great! As for the color I get, just as what you would expect from DS lotions. I mix it with my Pumped, which is also one of the best lotions I have EVER used, and my results are great. I have a great tan as is, so I don&#x27;t notice such dramatic results that you would expect, but still an amazing lotion. HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a new lotion to try out.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I have not found another lotion that I like as well as Black Legacy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great lotion!</li>
    <li> Very, very fast delivery. I was very skeptical about purchasing Tanning Lotions online, because we all have heard the horror stories. I didn&#x27;t want to buy it at the salon because it&#x27;s of course outrageously overly priced. So I purchased it on here.. And it&#x27;s the same thing! Smells just like it&#x27;s supposed to and work great. :) thanks!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! The real thing...and at half the price than at the salon. You cant beat that!</li>
    <li> I bought this product started to Love it.. just like all designer skin but if you have a fair to mid skin tone when you start off ...Make sure you RUB this in well and use very little. I turned Orange by using this product everyday and not rubbing it in well and over using the amount when I was applying. I tan fairly often have used many different lotions and this one is just very very full of all sorts of bronzers which is why it has a high DHA. Be very cautious when applying and how much I will probably now only use this product once a week for that extra boost.</li>
    <li> My wife has a naturally tanned complexion, but she insists on buying a bottle of this every year. All I can really say is it&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else she looks at it and it works to maintain/restore her complexion. The one part I do understand is that it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Must be real because it works as good as the salon one I purchased before. I was hesitant, but I don&#x27;t believe in the whole &amp;#34;if you don&#x27;t by from the salon, it must be fake&amp;#34;, Save your money and get this one LOL</li>
    <li> This is gold! The best tanning lotion ever! I just used it a day ago and I still have great color! It makes you dark dark I&#x27;m greek and I&#x27;m even shocked if you don&#x27;t want a tanning lotion that will make you dark I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it. But for more darker completions id say buy</li>
    <li> Good stuff but if not careful it will leave streaks</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and very nice lotion. Would buy it again. One happy customer</li>
    <li> I am a tanning bottle hoarder and I have finally found the stuff that really works!!  Love this stuff, got dark quickly! This stuff is amazing! Just make sure you clean between your fingers after applying it, it will stain!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Sealed in package, and not expired like some of the reviews warned.  I also like Adore, however this is my fav tanning bronzer!  : )</li>
    <li> This is amazing! Great smell and great color!</li>
    <li> I have been using Black designer skin bronzer for about two months now and it is definitely among my top favorites. The consistency is nice, not runny, and goes on smoothly. The scent is nice and you are not left with the burnt skin smell after tanning. The price is the best part seeing how you would pay triple in the salon, and the bottle is pretty big so you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. I will definitely be buying again when my current bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, awesome color</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not my favorite lotion. If you don&#x27;t make sure you wash your hands right after, you will have orange between your fingers. Nothing will top Obsidian by Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> The scent is not too great. It reminds me of strong vodka if you just put your nose to the bottle. The scent is much nicer when you put it on, but I&#x27;m always compelled to compare bronzes to luminary by ds. Luminary wins for me hands down, yet again. However this lotion really does deliver deep, nice, color. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Friday and it was delivered the next day!!  Amazing product, I&#x27;ve used Cypher Black and Complex Ion to change up lotions...&#x27;Black&#x27; ranks right up there with my favorites!  I used for the first time today and my color is deeper and darker and smells great.  Anybody that purchases this lotion will be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Turns you orange only used once</li>
    <li> If I could rate this a 0 I would.  I bought at the tanning salon, so their should be no chance mine is fake. I used the original black for years, but this leaves Mr streaked like I&#x27;ve used a poor self tanner.</li>
    <li> I ordered it, it arrived when expected. Perfect.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t ask for a better tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Nice scent....not too perfumy.  Results are good.  Came on time</li>
    <li> The packages are funny.&lt;br /&gt;No tracks, but that the lid is open and used&lt;br /&gt;I feel strange.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have used. Smells great and moisturizers skin well. Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> It was an amazing buy.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great price! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and just love it. I really like it more since I paid ALOT LESS for it. The color I get from using. this lotion is great</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite tanning lotion at all. I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it didn&#x27;t tan me like I expected.</li>
    <li> its okay not what i was expecting</li>
    <li> I am very pale skinned. I started tanning using this lotion. I normally take months to get any color at all. I e only used it a couple of times and have already gotten color. And I don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about the smell for it smells great! I almost didn&#x27;t buy it after reading some of these reviews but took a chance. Glad I did! Better than paying 100.00 a bottle at the salon. Their selling out of this stuff at my salon. And the bottle came fully sealed so it&#x27;s not fake. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Unsure if this is legit. I tanned last night using the product, smelled different from lotion I had from salon. This morning I am streaked and orange! NEVER experienced this with lotion purchased from the tanning salon. I think this is a sunless tanner packaged in a knock off bottle. Worst ever... and my tan is ruined!!!</li>
    <li> I actually got this stuff on here because I bought it at the salon and paid way  more! This price is like 50% off! I absolutely love the smell and seriously think it has helped my tan immensely! I have only been tanning a couple weeks and have a great color already! Just make sure you ask for a paper towel and wipe your hands prior to tanning or you will have marks! Will be buying here from now on!</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  Great product and price. Received on time. Extremely happy. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I won a packet for high sales at my salon on MN, absolutely LOVED it. I ordered my first bottle of it bc we do not carry the bottle itself, sad I know. Super excited to get my bottle and start tanning with it !! (: definitely recommend it to anyone. And like they&#x27;ve said, the smell is unreal. Before and after I tanned, i smelled like a sweet tart (:</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!!! Not streaky at all like others said. Great color for my skin. Of course it affects everyone differently but this lotion is legit!</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion for a quick base tan.</li>
    <li> Not as good as i thought</li>
    <li> Another great lotion from designer skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion. The lady At tanning salon tried to tell me to buy her lotion and that mine it fake wow I didn&#x27;t believe anything she said. Because I&#x27;ve used designer skin before and I know this is great quality!</li>
    <li> I love Designer Skin products I always  have, but the smell of the Black Legacy is not my fav.</li>
    <li> Love, love,love this lotion!!!! At a much better price than tanning salon!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this lotion it stinks SO bad!!!! And you smell worse after you tan! Its disgusting</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this lotion... I tan very easily &amp; it seemed like this one just couldn&#x27;t get me dark at all. I would get a little bit of color but after a few times of going it seems like my color went nowhere else. I could get darker in the sun however... Just not with this lotion in the bed. Smell isn&#x27;t that awesome either. I would probably recommend this lotion for someone who is more fair skinned, but for me, I think I need something a little bit darker.</li>
    <li> Just got it, can&#x27;t wait to try it. This lotion sells like hot cakes at my tanning salon!!</li>
    <li> Highlight recommend this tanning lotion! I also work at a tanning salon and we were able to try all the new 2015 lotions and we all loved it and just got the bottles in this week! Instant color, instant results! If anyone if familiar with another great lotion, Elusive, it&#x27;s just like that one but even better! You will not be disappointed  !!</li>
    <li> Never used this lotion before now. I have used designer skin lotions for years but never this one. now that I have, I am unsure whether or not this one is real or fake. when I first got it I shook it very well and used it three times over the course of a week. it caused streaking/blotching everytime. so I&#x27;m unsure how to give a review on this being that I am unsure whether it is fake. since designer skin lotions have always been the best lotions I have used to indoor tan.  I will be going back to the original black 20x. that has been my go-to lotion and I stand by it. this lotion is going to find its way to the garbage can.</li>
    <li> This lotion is horrible. It streaks. I looked like I slapped cheap orange tanner. I&#x27;m disappointed because I bought this based on the stars. I hope people read this and don&#x27;t make the same mistake. This product is not so amazing!</li>
    <li> This lotion worked very well and left a pleasant smell on your body.</li>
    <li> The lotion did not work properly. I don&#x27;t think the lotion is a legitimate lotion. The product works great when purchased directly from the tanning salon. The texture looked different as well. I would love the lotion if I could find a reputable company that probably hasn&#x27;t tampered with the product.</li>
    <li> Love love this lotion...&amp; love the speedy delivery I received from Amazon, not to mention the very very reasonable price :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I saw results after the first time I used it. Gets you super dark! Only thing is, make sure you thoroughly rub it in!!! Also, I suggest you get a base tan before using this lotion, as it has 35 bronzers!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!! And a little bit, goes a long way!! Dsnt smell bad at all, and much, i mean extremely cheaper than the salon!! It just soaks into ur skin.. I&#x27;m Cherokee Indian in me, and the 2nd time, I was dark as hell! Now I just ordered Exlusive, and I can&#x27;t wait.. More money but tried a packet at salon, ommmggg DARK IS ALL I CAN SAY! Will buy both again!! This pic is after 2xs in tanning bed!!</li>
    <li> Another quality lotion from Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Smells fantastic. Works great! Super tan</li>
    <li> Fast shipping amazing scent and color instantly. Like most bronzers they use nut extracts so STAY AWAY if you have a nut allergy, I will buy again,</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and GREAT product!!! Will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Black Legacy is an awesome tanning lotion! Gets you super dark super fast. Only thing is to make sure you RUB IT IN all the way, or it will streak. Excellent lotion. I stick to Designer Skin products and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve used yet! Make sure you order from Solarium.</li>
    <li> Really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing and soaks right into your skin. Noticed great color after too! Much cheaper here than the salon&#x27;s $129 price tag</li>
    <li> After using weeks and weeks, I saw both results</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I work at a tanning salon, so I&#x27;ve absolutely been through and tried out my share of lotions, and this is definitely a fave. The formula is so smooth, it literally melts on your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave even a trace of grease. The skin care is amazing, i always feel hydrated. The only downfall to this lotion is the bronzers. My Escapade gives better color right away honestly.. BUT it instantly gets you past your plateau. What it doesn&#x27;t have in bronzers, it makes up for in melanin production and stimulation. Love to pair with Bombshell for the ULTIMATE bronze look.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this lotion. Can be used in tanning bed or outside.</li>
    <li> I got pretty dark using this and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible, but it isn&#x27;t great either, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal to me. I would recommend this product to anyone that would like to get darker quicker.</li>
    <li> The absolute worse tanning lotion I have ever used!!!  Leaves lots of streaks &amp; turns my hands orange!!</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this lotion! It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest but I&#x27;ve literally went tanning twice with it and I already have a nice tan.</li>
    <li> Love the color this bronzer gives and Amazon price beats price at salon by over 50%</li>
    <li> Received my purchase last week. Have used a few times. It is giving me great color, but the after smell is burnt. The initial smell when first put on is pleasant, but it&#x27;s all down hill after that.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit much and also it left me with orange spots. I&#x27;ve used a lot of designer skin bronzers that went on evenly, but even though I rubbed this one in good and even I still have spots ðŸ˜±</li>
    <li> the best tanning stuff I&#x27;ve used to date!! Smells great,feels amazing,works awesome!! I just am so pleased!!</li>
    <li> Leaves you orange and streaked like a self tanner</li>
