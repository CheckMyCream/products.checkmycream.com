<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had several Norelco shavers and this is the best of them all. It is very quiet and the charge seems to last forever. It is the closest shave I have gotten from an electric razor. I used to shave with a blade but switched about 15 years ago. Will never go back. Great product.</li>
    <li> Grear shaving tool. I was so positevely surprised the first time I used it. And still I am. Easy to shave and clean. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about a month ago.  I&#x27;ve used a Norelco since 1994 and this my third Norelco.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The three features that sold me on this model are: &lt;br /&gt;The extra blade/cutter surface.   &lt;br /&gt;Long battery life (90 Minutes). &lt;br /&gt;Rinse under the faucet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use the shaver not only to shave my face daily, but also to shave my head.  I usually shave my head every three days.  So, the above mentioned features really come in handy.  I end up getting a smooth shave all over my head and face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Granted, that like most electrics the neck never gets as close as a blade.  But it sure doesn&#x27;t cause my neck to bleed.  As for the cost of replacement blades, the way I figure it, you pay the equivalent in blades and shaving cream.  In my case, I save by not visiting the barber shop.  The only improvement I would like to see, is a carrying case that will accommodate the plug.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the best razor i have ever had.  I will always buy a Norelco shaver.  Easy cleaning, long lasting battery and very nice look.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write up a review on this until I had used it for awhile. I&#x27;m very happy with it. It does exactly as advertised, and I have been impressed with not having to recharege it all the time. Cleans easy. It&#x27;s not perfect, but name me one electric razor that is? I would purchase this as a gift for someone, and be happy giving it.</li>
    <li> Still prefer a blade shave, but this razor works fine when you don&#x27;t want to lather up.</li>
    <li> Being a blade man most of my life I was reluctant to try another electric razor.  Prior experiences have been less than satisfactory. I have been using this new razor for a couple of weeks and it is doing a good job at providng close and comfortable shaves.  Not as close as a blade but certainly satisfactory.  I especially like the feature of cleaning using just hot water.  One drawback is the on/off switch--it is located on the bottom of the handle and I periodically shut it off while shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought it to replace a razor to avoid the infections that occurred from time to time as the result of a simple cut. I have been using it for a month now. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a variation in the feel of the rotating blades by adjusting the personal comfort control between the soft sensitive vs normal skin setting. It&#x27;s not as fast as the razor, but it does get close and my skin no longer protests as vigorously as before. In spite of replacing after shave lotion with facial moisturizing cream, my face never did like a razor... though the cream DID reduce the facial bumps. Cleaning is simple. You simply pop the head assembly and rinse under running water. It lost a star only for the time it takes to get close.</li>
    <li> I switched from using Norelco (for many years) to a Braun because of it&#x27;s innovative cleaning system.  BIG MISTAKE!  The cleaning system worked great but the shaver ripped up my face.  After about six months I bit the bullet and went back to Norelco.  This shaver is wonderful.  It shaves close with full comfort and cleaning under hot water is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver as a gift for my husband and he has submitted the following review: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have the an older Norelco that does not have a pivoting head and the extra shaving slots.  I thought the new shaver would have one-up on my older Norelco so I ordered the 9160XL.  Well, in my opinion, there was no difference in the quality of shave nor a reduction in shaving time. So I returned the shaver and will continue to use my less featured, older model.  I would, however, have ordered and been very satisfied with the 9160XL if I didn&#x27;t already have a Norelco as I do feel it is the best electric shaver on the market---and I&#x27;ve tried most all of them!</li>
    <li> this shaver performs extremely well. shaves as close as a razor, and a full charge lasts an entire month, longer if you dont shave every day. the instructions are absolutely correct, it takes a few weeks to get used to it, so dont be too put off if your first couple shaves are uncomfortable. if you have more sensitive skin, i would stongly recommend using minimal pressure at first, even if that means not getting the closest shave. once your skin adjusts, you can still get shaver burn if you press too hard, especially on the neck, so resist any urge to grind the shaver into your beard.    despite providing an incredibly close shave, it sometimes fails to grab every hair on the first couple passes and its a little tricky maneuvering around a strong adams apple. after taking those shortcomings into account, its still superior in every way to the other shavers ive used: a top model braun foil shaver, and a couple cheaper norelco models. while that doesnt qualify me as an authority on shavers, i can appreciate when a product basically lives up to expectations. even though the 9160 isnt quite perfect, it comes through with a reasonably fast, close and comfortable shave. here are a few tips that should help, especially when starting out:    1) shave BEFORE you shower. the shaver works better with a stiffer beard and your face will be less sensitive.  2) shave every day if you can.  the longer your beard, the more hair gets missed.  3) if any hairs do get missed after a couple passes, leave them. its not worth getting every hair in exchange for shaver burn. as you get more experienced with the shaver, youll get better at using it. touch up rogue whiskers with the sideburn trimmer.  4) this shaver has trouble with longer hairs that lie flat.  if you spot any after your first pass, use the sideburn trimmer to shorten them before touching up with the rotary blades. if youve already made a couple passes before you notice them, refer back to tip #3.  5) keep the tension settingon normal.  if you set it to sensitive, you just have to press harder and make more passes to get a good shave.  6) if you still have trouble with shaver burn, use a little apple cider vinegar as an aftershave. yes, it will feel like your face is being ripped off for a couple seconds. if youre not a fan of that sensation, you may dilute it. let it dry completely, then rinse it off. its the best  solution ive tried for neutralizing the burn.    EDIT:  if youre not feeling too sado-masochistic, jojoba oil actually works much better than apple cider vinegar.</li>
    <li> This is my third philishave. The last one is still working perfect after 5 years. This one is a step better with the new 3 ring design</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a month and it is still holding the charge.  Gives an excellent very close shave.</li>
    <li> This is indeed part of a new generation of electric shavers.  Previous shavers were relatively heavy and noisy.  That&#x27;s why I was shocked to discover the lightness, quietness and smoothness of this shaver.  The RPMs seemed slower than my previous Norelco classic.  And it was so quiet,in fact, that I thought this must be a toy (at an adult price) for a 6-year old boy to use while pretending to shave.  Surely Norelco cannot be serious!  The plastic for the unit is quite light.  But that doesn&#x27;t compare to the lightness of the charging stand.  Fitting the shaver into the stand can be a tricky maneuver.  I already dropped it once.  But after using the shaver I must admit it did give me a close shave.  And that&#x27;s the bottom line!  However, I would prefer Norelco include a heavier, better fitting stand in which to store the razor, not necessarily with a charging plug.  You can always charge it directly with the electric cord.  If Norelco would design a better stand I would rate it a Five.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before and didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like it but I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with the 9160XL. A good shave and easy to clean. A single charge lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 9160 shaves as close as a blade with greater comfort. It is a light razor and holds a charge for an incredible long time.  I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
    <li> Supper shaver.  I have owned about 5 different Norelco shaves over the years, and this is the best one.  It cuts close without irritating my skin.  The battery charge lasts for weeks.  And of course, cleaning the shaver by just rinsing it under the water facet is great.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE LEXUS OF SHAVERS. TAKE YOUR TIME AND GET USE TO USING IT, IF YOU NEVER USED AN ELECTRIC SHAVER BEFORE. I&#x27;VE HAD MINE ALMOST A MONTH AND IT IS GIVING ME A RAZOR SHAVE AT THIS POINT. DON&#x27;T DISPAIR. GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO GET USE TO THE MOTION REQUIRD TO SHAVE THE MANY DIRECTIONS OF YOUR HAIR GROWTH.</li>
    <li> This razor was better than expected, I&#x27;ve always owned a Norelco razor (35 years), and this is the best one yet. My old razor was about 8-10 years old when the battery would not hold a charge anymore - it was a noisy thing. This new razor is so quiet, I don&#x27;t wake up the Wife anymore when I shave. I had read the reviews on this model, some of the negitive reviews said the razor was too slow, not enough power, etc, but I disagree. This razor is light weight, easy to hold, easy to clean, holds a charge for over a month, a quick recharge, and as noted above - very quiet. I am very pleased with my purchase (July 2007), and I am glad I spent the extra $$$$ on this model.</li>
    <li> I tried though-out the years all kind of razors and I am always coming back to Norelco. Excelletn product. however I recommend that you buy spare knives when you order the razor, because norelco has so many different cutters and you never get the ones you need.  The 9160 XL is very, very quiet. I like the feature that you can wash it, but you should not do it too often. It will clog your sink. With dry cleaning you never get your razor 100% clean. With hot water you do. Modern desigh. Also good feature that you know how much power is left</li>
    <li> I had the same Philips shaver for over 10 years before upgrading to this model.  It really does shave closer and the pivoting heads allow for better contact under the jaw and chin area.  I really enjoy the ability to clean it with hot water as well.  After one month of use, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a month now and I have NOTHING bad to say.   Gives a close shave and is VERY QUIET !!!</li>
    <li> I hesitate on buying an electric rasor, but it really surprised me.  To be honest it&#x27;s not as close as an ordinary shave, but it is amazing. Very close shaving and with no blood :-). Excellent for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this over 4 years ago and it still works like new.  I have never replaced the heads and it still shaves quickly and quietly.  My wife always comments that it is so quiet compared to past Norelcos.  I like how this shavers heads can be rinsed off after shaving if you want to.  The battery holds a charge for a couple of months and I shave about every other day.  Most importantly, this shaves closer and smoother than any razor or shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  It is faster than any I&#x27;ve had as well.  I&#x27;m hoping this is still made as my son loves this as well and I would like to buy him one.  Mine was a refurbished model but you&#x27;d never know it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year now and I love it.  I used to shave with it before I got into the shower but now I shave with it IN the shower.  I feel I get a much better shave when it&#x27;s wet.  The blades are still good on it but I feel i&#x27;ll probably need to get them replaced within the next few months.  It is very quiet and it runs very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get a stand with mine so i&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with that.  I however did not purchase this through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****01/05/2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now stopped charging correctly.  Sometimes it will charge.  Most of the time it wont.</li>
    <li> I bought this particular shaver (9160XL) based on reviews in this column.  They were right, it performs as expected.  I have had an ongoing problem with blade razors (for years) such as skin irritation and ingrown wiskers. I have used this for 2 weeks, no irritation.  Excellent.  The directions, and other reviewers have mentioned a 3 week break in to get your face used to it.  I found that to be true for about the first week.  After that I seem to have it down, and get a consistent, as well as good, shave every time. A blade can be closer, however, this is easier! The only thing I find is that it takes two passes, first before I shower inthe morning, second right after.  I not competely sure why that is, but would suggest there is enough fricksion on the skin to cause a little swelling, but after a shower that goes down, and I can finish.  The cahrge seems to last quite well, 2 weeks on the first charge.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the stand that comes with the razor.  It could be much more solid, and easier to put the shaver into.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews on this site, I decided that this was the razor for me.  Right out of the box it had a small charge, but with about 4 hours of charging it had enough charge to last a month.  It was extremely quiet and it shaved my face almost as well as the \\&quot;Mach 3\\&quot; razors that I had been using. &lt;br /&gt;   However, when it comes to the neck, the job this razor did was less than desirable.  It started out seeming to me like it wasn&#x27;t shaving any hair at all, but after several uses my neck hair was not any longer, so it must have been at least keeping it a short length.  In addition it was starting to give me razor burn.  Basically right after using it my face was smooth and my neck had a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow. &lt;br /&gt;   After several more uses my neck looked like I was just shaving patches and the razor burn was getting worse.  In addition I began to notice that on my face the razor was missing hairs here and there.  I work at a hospital where I must look professional all the time, and this razor made me look like a bum with the poor job that it was doing.  It looks like I will be going back to my old razors.</li>
    <li> My husband has for years been in search of the perfect razor.  He buys new items as soon as they are released to the market.  He put this item on his Christmas Wish List.  So I granted the wish.  Amazingly, he says he loves it.  In particular he says it \\&quot;even shaves his neck\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this shaver so far.  I had a Norelco shaver before and loved it, but it was old.  This new one is very quiet and I like it.  It does seem to take a bit longer for me to shave now.  I think the whiskers just don&#x27;t get through the holes, many though they are.</li>
    <li> Well, I have been using this wonder over the past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great feeling while shaving, In cold mornings it&#x27;s not cold as was my previous shaver, shaves almost as close as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves only almost as close a a razor ... well not really a setback -&gt; not a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vanille:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, great feelling holding it, battery lasts long time, looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After compairing with friends previous series shaver -&gt; This one is better &amp; worth the extra $$</li>
    <li> Great elec razor for shaving. Just wash it out after each use and I clean the heads once a month.  Been using elec shaver for over 60 years and this is a very good one.</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed was how quiet it is. Fully charged it sounded like my old Braun just before the charge ran out. Also I was very satisfied with the close shave that I got. The only concern that I found was that, if you try to shave a two day beard there might be some pulling instead of cutting. Not   pleasant but does not happen frequently. Overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> Norelco really does make a great shaver,anyother I have used needs blades replaced every 50-60 days I&#x27;ve got a bad face to shave every morning and would highly suggest anyone should gave the smart razor a try. I would give it more than five stars I would give it 10 if there were that many. So any males should really consider this and Happy shaveing the smart way. Thanks Norelco good job.</li>
    <li> Shaver works good and is quiet. The clock did not work at all. Spent $4.00 for new battery and still did not work. Norelco said it can&#x27;t just replace the clock, have to send entire shaver back and pay shipping, be without shaver etc. It was not worth the aggravation. If you don&#x27;t need the clock the shaver is not bad. You would think they could just send you the twist out clock.</li>
    <li> Shaver&#x27;s good points. &lt;br /&gt;  Extended battery power between recharging.  Good close shaves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaver&#x27;s bad points.  &lt;br /&gt; Once the red light comes on indicating that a recharge is required the shaver quits and will not turn back on until it is charged.  There is no reserve power it just stops.  The Plastic clip covering the shaver head is extremely low quality, the original and replacement norelco sent both broke within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> The razor shaves very well. Only problem is putting it into the charging stand. My husband is a senior &amp; it&#x27;s hard to line up the connectors.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver overall.  The rechargeable battery has excellent life - average over 10 days per charge.  The selling feature is more cutting area for the 3 rotary blades - but the extra cutting surface doesn&#x27;t seem to speed shaving. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Some people like Remington or Braun style electric razors more, but if you like the rotary blade style electric razor like I do, this is the best razor you&#x27;ll ever find. Unbelievably good shave. Very well made.</li>
    <li> I got this razor in November and I am well pleased with it. I had its predecessor for 7 years and my skin became sensitive (not from the razor) so that I could only shave 5 times a week. I can now go at least 6 days and the comfort! The first time I turned it on I couldn&#x27;t hear it, it is so quiet. It shaves quickly and completely. I charged it first week of December and it finally ran out of juice the first week of February! I agree that these heads are delicate. I had to replace my last one by going to an authorized Norelco repair shop. However, with the deal Amazon gave me on the price I think I got exactly what I needed and can find no negatives!</li>
    <li> like it .. works well... keeps power long and is very quiet</li>
    <li> My husband is probably the hairiest man on earth. He gets a five o&#x27;clock shadow in 6 hours, now gets a five o&#x27;clock shadow the next morning. This is the best shaver he has ever used.</li>
    <li> Long battery life, clean shave, everything as promised. I still get some irritation, but acceptable. I would recommend at the old price ($99).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to shave any time without having to lather up etc. Does take about three weeks to get the feel of it and it isn&#x27;t quite as close a shave as a razor.  If you don&#x27;t like shaving this is about the best you will do.</li>
    <li> This is remarkably quiet compared to my previous Norelco which was in about the same class as this one, but with double row of blades.  Flex head really gets into touch spots.  Wish screen/blades were a little easier to disassemble and reassemble for cleaning, but it makes an entertaining mechanical puzzle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 89 year of father and he&#x27;s loves it. It gives him a shave as though he were using the old shaving cream and straight razor which to him is the best way to do it. Everything is easy for him to read which makes it even better as in today&#x27;s world they want to make everything more difficult than it really is. The price to him was quite expensive but, now it seems very well priced. He realized you get what you pay for and prices have changed since he was a young man. We would recommend this razor 100%. It is most diffentally a keeper for any man wanteing a very good shave. Everything you need is supplied with your purchase. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have owned this for a year now and love it.  It&#x27;s the quietest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I bought my first Norelco back in 1985, then switched to Remington and then switched to Braun and now back to Norelco.  The heads are smooth, it&#x27;s quiet, charges fast, easy to clean, light weight and shaves close without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you chose this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now.  It takes a LOT longer to shave than one that moves a bit faster - my last one was awesome but exploded in a car crash :).  Shaves easy, no burning afterwards, charge has lasted me over 3 weeks, can clean with water only.  Only thing I do not like about it is having to go over the same area again and again and again - which is why the charge lasts for so long - moves VERY SLOWLY, I thought it was broken the first time I turned it on.  Honestly, I would probably buy another one instead that shaves faster, but I will stick with it as it works :)</li>
    <li> The shaver is light and seems to do a good job. I am using it as a back up shaver at the present time. I do not have any complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for his birthday.  He&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now and doesn&#x27;t have any problems with it.  I even droped it on the ceramic tile and was able to put it back together and it still works.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for several years now. I have a thick beard, and am always looking for an electric razor that can give me the convenience and close shave. When you figure that a Gillette razor with all those blades you have to keep replacing, an electric razor can actually save you money from the conventional shave. My first Norelco was a Reflex that I inherited from my grandfather. It was pretty old, so its rechargable batteries died. The Quadra series came out, so I tried switching to that. I found it did give me a closer shave because the heads were flexible and could better fit the contours of my face. It worked fine, and then the Spectra came out. The differences between the Quadra and the Spectra are not great. The main thing is that the Spectra has a sensitivity dial (with my beard, I always have to have it set to the highest setting....which is pretty much like the Quadra). It supposedly has different heads....the blades are exactly like the Quadra and the slots are slightly different. Basically, there isn&#x27;t a big difference between the two with shaving. I did find that one benifit of the Spectra was that you can use it as a corded razor while it&#x27;s recharging (the Quadra and Reflex only run on batteries....so when the battery dies, you pretty much have to chuck the razor).  I can honestly say Norelco has seriously upgraded with the smart touch system. Each head has twice as many blades....with 3 rows instead of one. The heads also sit on a cradle that rocks back and forth. So it can reach any pesky curve or crevice on your face. It&#x27;s certainly worth plunking down the money if you have a heavy beard and are looking for a close shave from an electric razor.</li>
    <li> So after eight years of faithful service, my old Norelco Quadra Action finally gave out.  After checking out several options, I went for the 9160XL to be its replacement, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For starters, the SmartTouch has more holes and slots for beard to enter.  While some have said that they haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, I disagree.  It seems to take noticeably fewer passes to completely shave my face.  In addition to being faster, making fewer passes also reduces irritation.  It also seems to make shaving the neck easier - with the Quadra Action, there would always be a handful of stubborn neck hairs that would refuse to be cut no matter how many passes I made with the razor.  The SmartTouch seems to get these hairs with far fewer passes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my favorite feature of the SmartTouch is the adjustable settings, from \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; to \\&quot;Sensitive.\\&quot;  I loved my old Quadra Action, but it occasionally caused razor burn or irritation on my neck.  With the SmartTouch, I simply use the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting while shaving my neck and have not had any irritation or razor bumps.  And while in theory you sacrifice some closeness on the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, I&#x27;ve found the difference (if any) to be negligable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent razor that I cannot recommend highly enough.  Well done, Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is the quietest and best shaving electric razor that I have owned. It gives a close shave and the length of time between charges is outstanding. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco rotary electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned in, say the past 25-30 years.  My observations are: 1) it is the only Norelco rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that occaisionally \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; a whisker (Ouch) rather than cut it off. The motor sounds \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; with fewer RPM&#x27;s than previously-owned Norelco razors and that may be the problem.  2) the routine shave is OK.  3)the small icon indicating the razor needs cleaning lights up after every shave so it&#x27;s essentially useless. 3) the battery life after a charge is spectacular.  I get a month or more on a re-charge.  4) Assembly and overall quality seems very good.  Finally, I wish Norelco had not cut corners on the power of the electric motor especially on a shaver costing as much as this one does.</li>
    <li> as far as electrics go I guess it is simple to use ,Holds a great charge but my neck never gets shaved always going back and forth until you wind up with a good rash .</li>
    <li> If I have enough time(20 minutes), I get a decent shave.  Doesn&#x27;t match a blade shave unless you take the time.  Battery only lasts for about 3 shaves before recharge is necessary.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington, Braun, and 2 other Norelco models over the years.  This gives the closest shave of all.  No knicks, burn , or stubble. It seems to run much longer than most on a charge.   Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> After grinding away at my pretty coarse beard with my several years old high grade Braun razor I decided to switch Back to Norelco. I&#x27;d used their rotary razors for years but switched to Braun on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Newrelco arrived today and indicated full charge in about 2 hours. With some trepidation and much curiosity I turned it on to see how it dealt with my 3 day beard. I was, frankly, blown away. It Is much quieter, and Much faster. The Braun required that I go back and forth over the tricky spots on my neck, changing the angle of the razor until I found just the right stroke to cut them smooth. The Norelco seemed to have no trouble anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest surprise was my goatee area, chin and moustache. The Braun, in these particularly coarse and stiff areas, would object with a loud grinding sound and slow down preceptably. The Norelce breezed right over them, humming along with nary a glitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m More than pleased with my return to Norelco. The razor is a bit futuristic in style for my taste, but it sure gets that beard off. BRAVO!!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It shaves closer than even the space-age razor blades, it goes for a month or longer on one charge and it&#x27;s, well, pretty. The stand in which it sits is a little awkward to use because it&#x27;s hard to get the device to click in, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this razor and use it as an excuse to get all the gals at the office to feel your face.</li>
    <li> OK  I have held off entering my review on this razor. First I was a bit apprehensive about spending $130 on a razor.  Well I would do it again for this one.  I not only Shave my face I also sport a SHAVED HEAD I shave both everyday and I only charge this thing once a month, unbelievable!!  If I rate a blade razor&#x27;s closeness a 10 then I rate this razor a 9. It is not as close but it is as good as an electric can get.  However considering I nick and cut my head at least 4 times a week with a blade and have NEVER nicked or cut with the norelco.  Now it is a joy to shave my head!!!  And remember this is after 6 months so I have hit my head about 180 times.  You do the math :)    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Con : dump the silly little clock and put in a interactive charger,  this way you could store it in the charger and the charger would decide when to recharge it might want a manual override just in case.</li>
    <li> Bought this Noroelco men&#x27;s shaver for my dad for Christmas. He had an older one &amp; loved it. He loves this one, too. The battery stays charged through many shavings. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Report after several days&#x27; trial of the Braun 8995 360 Complete and the Norelco 9160XL electric shavers:     Packaging: the packaging of the Norelco was exceptionally challenging to open and required substantial damage to the box--query whether this could impair a refund claim?    Performance: the Norelco was the clear winner.  The Braun felt as if it was giving a closer shave but the results were patchy and incomplete in all areas including cheeks, upper lip, chin and neck, despite repeated passes.  99% of the hairs which the Braun missed were cut by the Norelco - no doubt performance will vary from individual to individual, but for me the difference was marked.    Cleaning:  again a clear win for the Norelco, which requires only rinsing under a faucet, unless you prefer a shaver which has been cleaned in a volatile petroleum product costing around $4-5 a month.  When removing the Braun shaver from the cleaning/charging unit, it is too easy to trigger a cleaning cycle which means either a 33 minute wait, or ending the  cycle prematurely (which the manual discourages) and shaving while the shaver still has traces of cleaning solution on it. An attempted discussion of the unit&#x27;s mechanism with an impatient and obtuse customer service representative at Braun was unhelpful.    Charging:  advantage Braun, which allows the fully charged shaver to remain in the cleaning/charging unit.  The Norelco shaver must be removed from its charging unit, or the unit must be disconnected, when the shaver is fully charged.  However, I do not use the Norelco charging unit since the shaver may be charged directly from an outlet.  The shaver still has to be disconnected when fully charged, but it seems to be easier to remember to disconnect the shaver than the charging unit. A full charge should be good for at least two weeks&#x27; shaving and recharging should take no more than an hour.  The Norelco shaver may also be used as a corded shaver, although this tends to shorten the battery life.Storage: the Norelco manual cautions twice that care must be taken to lift the shaver vertically and without a tilt when removing the shaver from the charging unit.  I infer from the double warning that there is an unexpected risk of damage to the shaver or charger or both in casually removing the shaver from the charger.  In any event, dispensing with the Norelco charging unit allows the shaver to be kept in a much smaller space, and certainly in a smaller space than that occupied by the Braun cleaning/charging unit.    Construction quality:  both shavers are comfortable to handle and have a nice heft.  The Norelco trimmer is smaller and appears to be less robust, but it performs at least as well as the Braun trimmer.       Hope these comments are helpful.

    <li> My previous shaver was a Braun and many years ago I used an older style Norelco shaver.  I like this model best of any I have used.  It shaves closer than I expected, and without irritation.  It is VERY quiet.      It is easy to clean by rinsing the head under water, and this requires no disassemby.  The battery lasts about a month of daily shaves before recharging is necessary.    Only drawback is that to recharge, you must charge for one hour, and over-charging can supposedly damage the shaver.</li>
    <li> It takes a little while to train you beard to use this electric razor.  Once that is done it does a pretty good job and I really like being able to wash it out with water and not needing to use a brush or cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> I have used Noreclo shavers from the time I began growing whiskers, and each new-and-improved model that Norelco introduces is always better than the previous.  This razor is very quick and leaves my face extremely smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 30 years and I thought it was time to upgrade to the new system.  So I purchased a 9160.  First the good news.  The Norelco 9160 is lightweight, quiet, and easy to clean (just rinse with water).  It also holds its charge far longer than my other Norelco razors (two weeks or more of shaving).      But the bad far outweighs the good.  The razor is seriously under-powered (low rpm) and very sloooooooow (despite manufacturer&#x27;s claims).  So I find myself using my old Norelco more often than the new one in order to save time.  Unless you have a very light beard and/or shave very often, this razor is not for you.  There are other problems as well.  The charging stand is an inconvenient accessory and it is easier to simply charge the razor without it.  The on/off button is placed right in the middle of the handle, resulting in frequent unintended shut-offs (what genius thought of that?).  The trimmer is weak and barely usable; it also pops open unexpectedly.  For that matter, the shaver heads are only loosely attached and the head easily pops off unless you are careful.  And this \\&quot;high end\\&quot; Noreleco shaver is relatively expensive.  If you insist on purchasing this shaver, consider the 8140, the same shaver without the graded power LED. Better yet, save your money.  Norelco used to do much better than this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco shavers.  They&#x27;ve always been reliable, so why switch.  This is the best model I&#x27;ve ever had.  Very close shave.  Comfortable.  The charge has lasted over a month without recharging, and it recharges very quick.  There&#x27;s also a deeper storage, and it cleans easier.  I rarely use a blade anymore, and in the long run, it saves a fortune, and the convenience / quickness of the Norelco shavers makes this daily activity a little less of a chore.</li>
    <li> The Norleco 9160XL serves the purpose of shaving my face better than any previous electric razor (owned at least 4 previous).  It takes care of the job at a better price than the $199 computerized version.  Plus, the ability to rinse out the head is a really cool change.  Also, the battery has good lasting power - much better than previous models.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Long a user of Norelco electrics, I purchased this unit as my new primary shaver and \\&quot;retired\\&quot; its predecessor to occasional uses at the office when I felt the 3 year old unit wasn&#x27;t cutting as well as it once did.  I know I could have tried new heads for the older unit -- but going with this unit for not that much more appealed to me.  And glad I made the decision.  I like the stand -- reduces bathroom counter clutter.  It is quieter than my older unit.  Seems to hold a charge a bit longer -- I recharge about every other week.  And it seems to clean easier -- instructions call for simply putting it under the water stream in the sink.  I continue to first dump the hairs first.  Shave is close, quick and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Item arrived much sooner than expected.  It was new and exactly as described.  In original box which included instructions.  Very very pleased with the shaver I ordered.</li>
    <li> Having used a corded Norelco for the past 30 years, and only replacing the blades once during that time, I find shaving enjoyable.  I know, I know, NO man likes to shave.  But, if you have to, get this razor!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this shaver. I have used Norelco shavers for many years, this one being the third that I&#x27;ve purchased. It is also my favorite. It works well, looks good, and was priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for past 18 years, so I&#x27;ve always liked their product.  Before I bought this item, I had an old (12 years old) Norelco that I wanted to replace.  My brother had bought the 9160XL shaver a while ago and after I checked it out, I thought it looked nice and was much quieter than the older model that I had.  I didn&#x27;t use his to see how well it would shave, so I decided to take a chance and buy it based on his recommendation.  However, I was skeptical about how good it would shave because it was too quiet.  After I bought and received the shaver, my very first shave was simply great.  I can&#x27;t recall the last shave I had that made my face this smooth.  The shave is so close that I don&#x27;t get a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock\\&quot; shadow until the next day!  Another very important thing is that after shaving, I don&#x27;t get a burning/irritating sensation with this shaver.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but my old Norelco would sometimes irritate my skin.  I also liked the face-contouring elements that they have added to this shaver.  I don&#x27;t have to fight and press the shaver as hard on my face to get the blades to touch my skin.  Cleaning the 9160XL is breeze; just rinse with water and let dry.  Battery life is great too.  I have used this for 2 months (over 30 shaves) and it still has 1/3 of its charge left!  I would strongly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find Norelco shaver due to its price and traditional (non-swivel) head design, which I was glad to find on Amazon.  Likes: (1) hot water cleaning, (2) 30 days of shaving per charge, (3) carry case, (4) dual current charger, (5) traditional design.  Dislikes: (1) charging stand (which I don&#x27;t use) because of the space it takes up, and (2) it doesn&#x27;t have a charge status indicator that counts down shaves (only slide rule).  Great product which I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectation. Smooth cutting. Close cutting. Quiet. A good value.</li>
    <li> The rotors in the shaver that turn the blades in the head are made of some sort of plastic.   They are pencil shaped and have a tiny plactic triangular piece at the tip of the rotor.    These tips break off and Phillips has no way of repairing them or sending a replacement piece.    I ended up returning my razor to Phillips in an effort to get my money back.    Too, bad, great heads and used to make great razors too.    Please avoid my problem.   Jay</li>
    <li> This has been an excellent shaver since I&#x27;ve had it. It&#x27;s well made, and I have hopes it will last as well as the last NORELCO I had. Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  It holds a charge for about two or three weeks at a time, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it does a pretty good job getting a close shave, and it doesn&#x27;t take long for the razor to fully charge!  This is the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had norelco shavers. I changed my old one becouse of battery problems, so thisone, the 9160xl, was just what I expected. &lt;br /&gt;Has a great battery, easy to clean, shaves well, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got my husband one of these for Christmas as he desperately needed a new razor. He picked it out, I paid for it and he says it works great. He can shave more often now and gets a very smooth shave and afterwards we spend time striking poses similar to those in the men&#x27;s shaving commericals on TV where sexy, baby-faced male gets his face rubbed by sexy-I-love-smooth-faces female. Only we don&#x27;t get paid for it.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver.  Battery life is outstanding.  I&#x27;ver had it for over a month and only charged it twice.  Very comfortable on face and neck- I&#x27;ve havent gotten that typical razor burn you get with an electric shaver.  I have sensitve skin so this shaver works well for me.  However, it isnt as close of a shave as my last Norelco or the company claims it to be.   &lt;br /&gt;   Overall I would recommend this product :) &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with Norelco for thirty years.  This razor provides a close, smooth shave.  It&#x27;s the best Norelco shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  There is only one niggling problem with this razor, it&#x27;s the button to actuate the trimmer (that&#x27;s the \\&quot;-\\&quot;).  The sliding release button is slippery and the raised surfaces on it are too small to provide a grip.  Otherewise this razor performs superbly.  And it seems to be somewhat quieter than my previous generation Norelco.  That&#x27;s also a plus.  One longevity note, the SmartTouch-XL has a more complicated cutting system with more moving parts, so only time will tell if the system is durable.  Based on past Norelco experience, it will be.</li>
    <li> Positives - very quiet motor, long lasting battery,  &lt;br /&gt;Negative - does not shave well in the area between chin and neck (below the jaw). Battery charger is bigger than most models - so little inconvenient to carry during travel.</li>
    <li> Have owned 4 Remingtons, 2 Braun, 3 older Norelco s and about 4 other misc. &lt;br /&gt;The 9160XL SmartTouch is the best yet. Obvoiusly I have not bee pleased with other machines. Like this onw - smooth, shaves close (not as close as a blade, no electric can do this), easy to maintain and a lot of other good stuff, Most cannot go wrong by buying this.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by Norelco and this is his favorite razor so far.</li>
    <li> This razor has a really long battery life and gives a smooth shave, but does not seem to get any closer than previous generations.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco, the last being a 5615X Advantage I broke by accident after having it for six years, and the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned so far. I get an incredibly close shave, as good as or better than a regular blade which is a huge surprise to me and it&#x27;s  blissfully quiet as well. Heck of a score for $99, that&#x27;s for sure. I ordered a set of spare blades along with the shaver and for some reason Amazon shipped them separately one with UPS, one with USPS which meant I had to stay home two days instead of one. All in all a great buy but the shipping foolishness was annoying and has me questioning whether I should consider  Amazon for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I have not shaved with an electric razor for 30 years. I have tried electrics on an off over the years, but I always went back to blades for the close shave I wanted. I got this shaver 3 days ago and after charging it up, I tried it out. I was completely amazed at the smoothness and closeness of the shave! The instructions say that it will take up to 3 weeks for my face to adjust to the electric system. The shave I got was within 95% of the closeness of the blade on the first use. This shaver is easy to clean out after use and the settings for the head adjustment are great. I would recommend this shaver to anyone that wants to convert from a blade to an electric or wants an upgrade to his electric. This shaver is awesome. Buy it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a very old norelco, and I decided it is time to updated it. But this product comes with a lot fancy features, but it does not make a big diference after all, it just a litle bite better than my old one. I would knew I would not buy it.  they try to make believe that you new those new features, is just not true</li>
    <li> Ive had the shaver for 4 weeks and it performs as expected (excellent). It comes with a very nice travel case. Much better than my previous Norelco model.</li>
    <li> This razor was a Father&#x27;s Day Present.  He has had Norelco before and says this one works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased the razor reluctantly after my other electric razor died. I had a cheaper model before that worked fine, so I really didn&#x27;t see the need to spend a little more for this device. I am glad I did though, since having used this razor for over a month now, I can say it was well worth it. The features and quick recharge are nice. Being easy to clean is great too. But the best feature of all is the razor&#x27;s perfect function as a shaver that hits every area, but is not harsh. Razor burn is a problem for me, or was. I no loger get it and this is a dry razor, you don&#x27;t need lotion or water. I highly suggest this razor as a complete and comfortable device. It is worth the added expense.</li>
    <li> This Norelco Shaver is the best shave that I&#x27;ve had with an electric. I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about a month, but from the first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t beleive how quiet it was. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m 17 years old. I have been shaving for about 2 1/2 to 3 years now. The thing is, I have very sensitive skin - razor blades kill my face - literally - so I had to switch to an electric razor. And i&#x27;m glad I did.    Pros: It&#x27;s very easy on my face; no razor bumps, no irritation from going over slight acne, no redness, no irritation. It cleans easy, it charges quick, and I&#x27;ve been went 2-3 months without recharging it.    Cons: If you let your facial hair \\&quot;grow out,\\&quot; it can be difficult to shave it. The longer it is, the harder. If you wait longer than three days, you&#x27;ll have a tough time (atleast I do) getting the hair off and getting a smooth shave. But if you use the razor every 1 to 3 days, there&#x27;s no problems. Getting a \\&quot;blade smooth\\&quot; shave is possible, but it&#x27;s not going to happen in 60 seconds.    Be patient with it. There are definitely improvements that need to be made, but it&#x27;s a great product. I think I got my monies worth, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to newbies and experienced users alike.</li>
    <li> I find that the Norelco shaver meets all my expectations.  It is true that it does not give as close a shave as a razor, but, in my case, I am using blood thinning medication, and it provides me with a close shave without the knicks and bleeding.  It is easy to keep clean.  The charging procedure allows the shaver to be ready when I need it.  I would recommend it to anyone who prefers it to blade shaving[[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]].</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Jr electronics and it is new, after I saw good reviews at consumers reports.  It was my first shaver, it&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and it works better now, wait, give it some time for your face to adjust to the change. When I first used it it didn;t work as expected but once your face adjust, it works better.</li>
    <li> Prior to getting this razor, I shaved roughly every three days with a Mach 3. This was my first shot at an electric in about ten years, so I wanted to buy a quality product. I have relatively sensitive skin, but nothing too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is no good at shaving longer hair (&gt; 1-2 days of stubble). It pulls the hair and requires ten minutes to do a mediocre job. However, if you use the razor consistently every morning, it does a pretty good job. I&#x27;d recommend making one pass on the sensitive setting and then following up with the &#x27;normal&#x27; setting.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. performs as advertised.  Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Gives my sensitive skin with tough, fast-growing beard (not a good combination) a close, comfortable shave.  Charge lasts a remarkably long time.  Extremely quiet operation.  I&#x27;m very, very satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of comprehensive reviews here already, so I won&#x27;t write much. I just wanted to confirm that this razor does cut much better than other mid-range Norelcos that I&#x27;ve used in the past.    After shaving with this razor, it takes until about 3:00 for my beard to grow out to the level my previous Norelco cuts to in the morning. It&#x27;s also very smooth and doesn&#x27;t rough up my neck at all. It&#x27;s great to be able to clean it under running water everyday and the new battery is a huge step up from the old NiCds.    I don&#x27;t know if it will happen again, but I got this on Amazon recently when they had it for 60% off which was an amazing deal. Even at the original price though, it&#x27;s probably worth the upgrade if you&#x27;re using any of the mid-range razors.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want a rash? At first it was ok but as the 3rd-4th week I developed a rash,it seemed convenient but when you consider the outcome it&#x27;s not worth it.Going back to the triple bladed hand razor,now!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad as a gift and hoping he&#x27;d \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; from the razor but it didn&#x27;t really work all that well. He says the product is great and gives you a more closer shave than the Gillette cartridge razor but he still keeps using the razor!! My efforts to make him switch completely has failed so far:)   I guess its difficult to move away from what you&#x27;ve used for decades especially for older people. The only limitation on this product from his opinion is that it doesn&#x27;t trim the side burns as good as a blade and I feel its a bit expensive too. So a negative star for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor and was very disappointed compared to the Braun (that I had used previously) or a wet shave with a blade.  I was hoping for better results based on the reviews, but ended up agreeing with the reviews that panned this shaver.  I put the shaver aside for a while and went back to wet shaving with a blade.  THEN, I was told to try a wet shave with it -- I tried it again and what a difference this made!!  The result was just as good as a blade shave, and I can wet shave with this faster than I can with a blade -- this is important to me as I want to minimize the time I spend shaving.  And I don&#x27;t need to skip days to build stubble for a better shave.  If I&#x27;m using the sink rather than shaving in the shower, all I need to do is frequently wet the head of the shaver in warm running water and continue shaving.    There were many good reviews that mention wet shaving when I bought the shaver and perhaps many people are familiar with this, but none seemed emphatic about the huge difference between wet shaving and dry shaving with this electric razor.  There are reviews that pan the shaver for its dry shaving performance, and I agree fully.  Wet shaving was the key for me, and now I&#x27;m getting the fastest and smoothest shaves yet.    Regarding battery life, the shaves are now so fast that the shaver runs at least 3-4 weeks before I charge it again.  Battery life was not as good when I tried tedious dry shaving with this razor.     A tip -- I keep a small ultrasonic cleaner near the sink for cleaning eye glasses.  It does an incredible job and minimizes the possibility of scratching plastic lenses -- simply rinse them off in the sink.  If I detect any sourness of the razor head after it has dried from the previous day&#x27;s use, I simply immerse the head a couple of times for about 10 seconds with the razor running into the ultrasonic bath (ultrasonic cleaner is off).  I use a single squirt of shampoo from a liquid pump dispenser into water for the bath solution.This cleans the head and eliminates any odor after drying following wet shaving.</li>
    <li> For some reason, my husband always insisted on a corded razor.  He finally gave up the cord and loves this razor.  He can shave while walking around, in the car, or anywhere he chooses.  This is a great razor and one that requires you to rinse it out so it is always cleaned out.  The lights let you know when to charge and when to clean it with water. It charges rapidly and has never let him down yet and he has been using it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased the HQ9160 model, which is almost the same as the 9170 except the 9160 does not have the jet cleaning system. And I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. Here&#x27;s why.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before switching to an electric shaver, I used the Mach 3 razor for over 5 years. Over the years I find that my skin got more and more sensitive to manual shaving, probably because I always shave against the grain (of the hair). Also, since I have acne problems, the razor blades often caused cuts that led to minor bleeding, which sometimes resulted in scarring. After using the HQ9160 electric shaver, all of the problems involving the skin irration and the unwanted bleeding are gone. And I think the electric shaver gives as close of a shave as my Mach 3 razors, especially in the upper neck area, near the throat. Plus, with the irration problem now gone, I have the option of shaving again in the evenings before I go out.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TIPS to improve your electric shaving experience:  &lt;br /&gt;- Wash, clean and dry your face before shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;- Have the razor heads glide lightly over your skin. Don&#x27;t press the heads hard against your skin - it makes the cutting worse. Instead, you should use your free hand to gently stretch the skin while you shave over the area.  &lt;br /&gt;- Take the heads out and use a degreasing liquid such as Philishave razor cleaner or rubbing alcohol to clean heads once a month.  &lt;br /&gt;- Lubricate the heads with a Philisahve shaving spray or a drop of mineral oil once a month.  &lt;br /&gt;- For extremely senstive skin, you may want to use a shaving powder or oil such as the Remington Face Saver Pre-Shave Powder Stick.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;REASONS I chose the HQ9160 over other models and brands:  &lt;br /&gt;- Price. I bought it for about $100USD (incl. shipping) from a famous online auction site (part of the name rhymed with Kay).  &lt;br /&gt;- Battery. Its Lithium ion cell yields 90 minutes (~30 days) of shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;- Travel pouch.  &lt;br /&gt;- 3-ring head. It has 50% more shaving surface vs. 1 ring head.  &lt;br /&gt;- Contour head. It does a better job over bumps and corners.  &lt;br /&gt;- Easy cleaning. Just rinse in hot water for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Norelco 6865XL that I&#x27;ve had for about 5 years or so, and the 9160XL makes a world of difference. There are minor improvements - I like the color, it seems to clean easier, and the battery lasts a LOT longer. I haven&#x27;t re-charged it yet after three weeks of continuous use, and I have half a battery left. But the vastly superior feature to the 9160 is clearly the increased size of the shaving surface. Instead of one ring of cutters per head, there are now three, leaving virtually no open space on the razor head to miss your face. For me, I would say shaving now takes - coincidentally - 1/3rd as long and I get a much better shave for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other nice additions I like are the more intelligent placement of the \\&quot;small\\&quot; holes for the cutters. On the 6865 the large openings were on the outside and the small openings were on the inside of the razor, but on the 9160 the small openings are dispersed across the razor head in a more sensible manner. Also, there is a sensitivity dial that may prove useful to some people, especially on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for downsides, there are two: I don&#x27;t think this razor is significantly better at shaving the neck than my previous one, although the increased shaving area helps out. I think few electrics do a stellar job in this area so it came as no surprise. More importantly, the new \\&quot;rocking head\\&quot; mechanism on the SmartTouch series seems to be pointless. Perhaps it&#x27;s helping and I can&#x27;t tell, but when I pay attention to it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to move hardly at all, and not in any way that gives the appearance of being useful. Since the major bonus on this razor - the 3 rows of cutting heads - is available on the SpeedXL line, one might be better off with just getting that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning: some of the other reviews complain that this isn&#x27;t better than a traditional non-electric razor. Probably not, few electrics are. It takes quite a bit of time to get used to an electric, but it&#x27;s worth the patience.he patience.</li>
    <li> After replacing a much cheaper razor with this norelco model, it felt like going from a model T to a BMW. Great razor and the battery life is much longer than I have experienced in other razors. recommended</li>
    <li> I bought the Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch for my husband as a gift. For weeks, he has raved about the Norelco and the great shave. He had his old shaver \\&quot;for ages\\&quot;. He can&#x27;t imagine why he didn&#x27;t get the Norelco sooner. It is so much easier on his skin.     I gave this product five stars (not 3 stars as is noted above)</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco shaver that I have purchased in the past 15 years. I had the 985RX which is out of service. I am still using the last one that I purchased about 6 years ago. Everyone is so much more technically advanced then the last. My other shaver the 6885XL still charges up to 37 min down from a max of 48 min, not bad for an 6 year old shaver. I only replaced the blades once and I still get a great shave. This 9160XL is excellent. It is the quietest of all, the first charge lasted over 3 weeks, it charges the fastest and the shave is close and smooth. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now and it has lived up to all expectations. Norelco continues to make a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver. I have used the shaver for over two weeks and the battery still does not need to be recharged. The \\&quot;rinse under the faucet\\&quot; feature makes it easy to keep the shaver clean. The shaver heads give a smooth clean shave. I have owned several Norelco shavers over the years but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> While I am happy with my Norelco purchase from Amazon, I would like to let everyone know that if you purchase something from an Amazon partner, those partners have a nasty habit of tripling the cost of shipping and handling, and making an very nice extra profit. Because Amazon has no control over this, or maybe they don&#x27;t care, I am done with Amazon....</li>
    <li> I am more of a \\&quot;blade razor\\&quot; sort of person, so few electric shavers have stood up to my expectations.  My last one, a wet/dry Panasonic was very nice, but still had trouble in the neck areas.  The Norelco 9160 does much better in \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; areas, however - it just doesn&#x27;t shave that close.  By midday I need to go over my face once more and by 5PM, I look like I haven&#x27;t shaved in a day or two. &lt;br /&gt;This product is not all bad.  It is very quiet, which is nice.  And it did not irritate my skin whatsoever, even the first week (like many other electric shavers).  Lastly, being able to just rinse out the shaver with warm water makes cleaning a breeze; I actually LOVE that feature!  So I wish this one would have worked out, but I think I may return it under Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;money-back guarantee.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> As a longtime rotary shaver user, the 9160XL is easily the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, replacing a unit I had for 10 years. The battery on that one gave out a few months ago, so I did my research and settled on the 9160 as a replacement. Am I glad I did. It give a nice, close shave. The charge seems to hold forever. It&#x27;s much quieter than any rotary razor I&#x27;ve ever used. And the adjustable heads work better than I thought they would. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One word of advice. I purposely avoided the \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; models because I figured it might be a bit of a hassle. But now I&#x27;m wondering if I might have liked it. Norelco recommends rinsing this unit about every other day, which is sort of a pain, but easy enough to do. Just curious if the self-cleaning base unit for only $10 or $20 extra might have been worth it in the long run.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll find out in 10 years.</li>
    <li> While this shaver works very well out of the box, the instructions are not clear, and the help on the phone just reads the unclear instructions back to you.  On the one hand the instructions say to use the plastic cap to protect the head, but they also say wash after each use and leave the head widely sprung open to dry.   This takes a lot of storage space, so be forewarned, and you can&#x27;t put the cap on while it&#x27;s drying.  There&#x27;s also a crypic comment that one should oil the heads occasionally by putting the oil in the center hole.  But there are many \\&quot;center holes on the inside and outside, so it isn&#x27;t clear where to oil.  And neither the phone nor email helpers knew anything about oiling.   &lt;br /&gt;  But otherwise, it is quiet and shaves as good as my old Norelco 985.</li>
    <li> Have been using a blade razor for 50+ years, thinking I couldn&#x27;t &lt;br /&gt;get a close enough shave. After using this shaver for a few weeks &lt;br /&gt;I think this is close enough and my wife seems pleased as well. The &lt;br /&gt;shaver is quiet and charges quickly. The charge also lasts. This is a &lt;br /&gt;much more convenient way to shave.</li>
    <li> This is everything they say it is.  I&#x27;ve been using a Remington electric shaver for the past few years and wanted an upgrade.  I&#x27;ve had the Norelco for 2 weeks now and this shaver is extremely quiet in comparison.  I get a very close shave every time whereas with my previous model I would have to skip a day to get results like this.  Honestly I could shave twice a day if needed.  Also, it holds a charge (2 weeks and counting).  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great. Quiet and convenient to clean. Battery seems to last quite a while on a charge. After about 2 weeks of quick uses the battery still shows as fully charged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not too pleased with shipping/delivery, however. Product was listed as in stock, but was not shipped till 5 days after purchase. Arrived 8 days after that. I&#x27;d buy elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> Great razor, you get a nice smooth shave, you are able to wash out the blade and shaver with running water which is pretty slick.  Pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used various Norelco shavers for 30+ years and this is the best shave i ever got!!</li>
    <li> This razor is my second norelco rotary, my first is a 5100 series about 20 years old.  Compared to that, this razor is much cleaner, quieter, and more comfortable.  The new razor doesn&#x27;t *sound* like it turns the blades as fast or as powerfully as my corded dinosaur, but it seems to me that it cuts more effectively, which is what I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this new razor is a breeze - just a quick rinse under hot tap water and I&#x27;m done.  Having cleaned it this way, I can&#x27;t imagine paying for the extra cleaning station and chemicals - I note with some interest that the printed user instructions and website FAQ also recommend the hot tap water cleaning method...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing my shave to a triple-blade disposable system I use, the electric doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close - I can&#x27;t tell immediately after shaving (my face feels smoothly shaved in either case), but I notice stubble somewhat earlier with the electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave about once a day - maybe 5-10 minutes or so.  So far, the battery life is about a month as advertised.  Very convenient indeed.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had Braun, Panasonic and Norelco. Braun has the great cleaning system, but the foil irritates my face. The Panasonic was terrible. Didn&#x27;t shave well at all. I&#x27;ve liked norelcos over the year for comfort, but they it can take a while, with many passes to get a good shave, especially in the neck..  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This unit, by far the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used. One pass for most parts of my face, a couple on the neck. It quiet, you hardly think it&#x27;s working then you feel your face.. great stuff. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Razor is quite, light, cuts well and has good features such as washable heads.  The charging stand would be a smart idea if you could keep the razor there all the time like an electric toothbrush, but once the razor is charged, it must be removed.  So I just removed the stand completely and charge using only the cord, just like my old razors.  Wish Norelco would buy back the stand as it really serves no purpose.  The stand also has a little clock mounted on it which is an additional dumb idea.  Maybe Mr. Philips&#x27; son-in-law designed this part of the package.  Give him a broom next time.</li>
    <li> not what you want to use before a date but this is a great elec shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a shick quattro razor but i got this for mornings I just dont feel like shaving and I have found it does just about as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to have an older one of these that did pretty good but just not good enough, but this one does great!  And despite what another reviewer said i found this to be real comfortable to hold and easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention how fast it charges and just how long it keeps a charge.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor as a replacement for my dying Norelco 4821XL which I purchased about ten years ago. I have been a loyal Norelco fan for 30+ years and with the addition of the Norelco 9160XL, I hope to continue that tradition. The first thing I noticed about the 9160 is HOW QUIET IT IS! My old razor made so much noise that it was like shaving with a hedge trimmer. The first time I turned on the 9160 I had to double check that the batteries were charge because of how quiet and smooth it runs. The next thing I am happy to report is how close and smooth a shave it produces. WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can say about the razor is that there is SO MUCH PLASTIC on it that I am concerned about how well the unit will hold up with age. In addition, the lock for the trimmer is rather difficult to get your finer on to release especially if you do not have long fingernails. I wonder if Norelco (and I hope you are reading this) could make the ridges on the trimmer release a wee bit higher so that those of us fingernail challenged people can have less trouble releasing the latch?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of that minor annoyance, the razor is lightweight, quiet and produces a great close shave that will have your face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. If you want a great razor I would look no further and jump on this puppy also while you are at it you might want to pickup a set of the HQ9 replacement heads so that down the road when the razor tells you that heads need replacing you have a spare set to replace them with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciao!</li>
    <li> I am 79 years old and have a heavy beard.  I have used Norelco rotary shavers ever since they arrived on the market.  I found these shavers to be far superior to the competing foil shavers.  The Norelcos give me a close and smooth shave, equivalent to that of a Gillette or Schick razor.  The 9160XL is my sixth Norelco shaver and to me, it is the best rotary shaver yet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it shaved any better than the Braun Shaver.  Unfortunately Norelco came out with the newer model just after I had purchaed the 9160XL</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I have not been able to use my 9160XL every day, so I still get skin irritation, hopefully that will change as I get used to it.  However, there is still some problems.  While generally I like this shaver, right now it does not seem to catch all of my facial hair, even when my 47 year old skin is pulled taught.  This provided additional irritation as I must circulate the floating heads over and over again in many areas.  The other features of easy cleaning and nice design are great, but I really want a good shave to go with it.  If it gets better, I will try to access this review to update it.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco products, and this one is by far the best shaver I have ever owned!!</li>
    <li> After 42 years of using the traditional foiled razors of Remington and Braun, I discovered the joy of the Norelco.  It is quiet, gives a smooth close shave, and does not require monthly replacement of expensive foils.    I really liked finding a shaver that was not made in China.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Better shave than my old Norelco, fast recharge, and nearly six weeks of shaving on a charge!!  The plastic cap, however is poor compared to my old ones.  The new ones last only a couple months at best and cost about $9.00 to replace.  (The little retaining tabs break off).  The older style lasted many months and were cheaper to replace.  It looks pretty silly to be traveling with a $150 shaver and have the cap held on by a rubber band!  My fantasy is that some Norelco exec will see me shaving in an airport rest room and ask about it.  apstein</li>
    <li> I just received the 9160XL today to replace my previous model #7864XL, and am a bit underwhelmed. It feels cheaper to hold than my previous Norelco model, and upon close inspection of the screens and cutting wheels, my old \\&quot;1-track\\&quot; 7-series were of a much higher quality and had a much greater degree of precision with regard to holes &amp; slits than this new 3-track (Speed-XL) model. Comparing them up close, it&#x27;s really disappointing. Also, the charging base has a cheap feel and should be weighted. I would have expected much better quality for $140.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Norelco&#x27;s for 40 years. I got him this one for his birthday and he says it&#x27;s the best ever! Great shave on his tough beard. I agree, his face is smooth as if he used a blade.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used the Norelco CoolShave in the shower with shaving cream which gives a close shave, but is much more work than with this razor and does give me burning feeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor used as reviewer L. Huang advices with the Remington shave stick feels great and cuts hairs on neck which other razor did not do well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use the razor just after I shower when my beard feels primed for shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Honestly, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this razor, especially if used as reviewer L. Huang suggests.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 9160XL about a month ago, and during that period I shaved one side of my face with the 9160XL, and the other side with my 3 year old Panasonic ES8092 with it&#x27;s original foil and blade.  After 30 days I&#x27;ll call it a draw.  I ended up returning the Norelco.    The nice features of the 9160XL compared to the Panasonic are:    1.  It&#x27;s very quiet.  2.  The battery went the whole month on one charge, and it still didn&#x27;t need recharging.  3.  It travels better in that you probably won&#x27;t need to recharge it while away.  Even if you do, the charger plugs into the shaver rather than needing a charging stand.  4.  It does a slightly better job in the neck area.  5.  It&#x27;s gentle on your face    What&#x27;s not to like?    1.  It feels lightweight and a bit cheap (however, some may consider it&#x27;s lightness to be a positive).  The Panasonic feels more like a quality appliance.  2.  The Norelco feels like it operates in slow motion compared to the Panasonic.  Despite the claims of the increased  shaving speed because of the new head design, the Panasonic went through my beard quicker.  3.  It could only match the closeness of the Panasonic with a fairly worn foil and blade.  4.  It&#x27;s too much money for what you get.    Update: Got a new foil and blade for my Panasonic.  I can now say that on my face the Panasonic blows the Norelco out of the water when it comes to shaving closeness.</li>
    <li> So 1989 gave us lift &amp; cut.  The late 90&#x27;s gave us Norelco&#x27;s Quadra system.  Now finally, for the first time in its 40+ years as the leading maker of rotary shavers, Norelco gives us a system that covers more area, with more speed and comfort than ever before.  It doesn&#x27;t just promise a faster, closer shave, it delivers.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for all guys, but let me try to break-down the electric / blade dilemma.  Blades are closer, but cause irritation.  So most blade users tend to skip a day to avoid that.  Furthermore, you get a closer shave with a blade if you let the stubble grow a bit, so skipping a day is a common practice.  But blade shaving gives guys far more options in terms of products to choose from, both for shavers and shaving conditioners and gels.  Simply put, if you want a close shave and the ability to control all aspects of shaving, and see what you&#x27;re cutting, the blade is the best way to go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s electric.  An idea hatched from the late 1950&#x27;s space age / cold war era that told us that blade shaving was a thing of the past.  Electric shaving promised to be as close as a blade for decades, but never delivered.  But over the years it has delivered its promise of a safer, faster, and less irritating shave.  For guys who don&#x27;t like shaving around the sensitive lips and nose areas, electric has its advantages. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All electric shavers fail to cut the longer neck hairs effectively, including the new Norelco XL series.  But the XL is still a major breakthrough.  Simply put, it has switched me back to electric after 6 years of using blades.  The new rotors have three rows of blades, and an innovative mix of slots and holes for stubble, making-use of dead space that was Norelco&#x27;s weakness since their beginning.  The XL has the inward tilt mechanism introduced with the Quadra.  And it has the late 80&#x27;s lift-and-cut technology, which doesn&#x27;t work exactly as advertised, but it does shave flat areas of the face as closeas a blade (the cheek and upper lip areas do get the closest cut). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The XL series is easy to clean under hot water, another development from the Quadra series, which is even better and more effective here.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The XL gives me the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  And I can use it daily for a consistent smooth look without irritation.  Add the recent development of products like Anthony for Men&#x27;s alcohol-based pre-shave solution, and electric shaving suddenly has advantages worth making the switch.  I liked the XL so much, I got the 9160XL for home, and the less-expensive 8140XL for my office.  The 2 shavers are the same, except for the smart touch pivoting feature, which is not a big bonus in my opinion.  The pivoting feature makes it possible to shave the neck and chin faster, but the results for both shavers is exactly the same, meaning that some neck hairs are going to be missed, making it necessary to use a blade to do some quick cleanup.  Electric is far from perfect, but this is the closest and most comfortable electric yet.  I&#x27;m sticking with it. &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;And since the XL is Norelco&#x27;s top of the line model, it is still made in Holland.  All other Norelco&#x27;s are made in China.  it won&#x27;t be long before the XL is made in China as Norelco develops it&#x27;s next breakthrough.  But the XL is the big breakthrough as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I&#x27;m hooked.  And I&#x27;m a total shaving geek now.</li>
    <li> The model number is important, as others of this series have cumbersome sounding \\&quot;extras\\&quot; - very costly - which I doubt add anything (a cleaning device and a gel to shave with). &lt;br /&gt;     Having used rotary Norelcos for nearly 50 years, I have found some \\&quot;upgrades\\&quot; to new models to be of limited value; but the 9160XL is a clearcut improvement from my 5+ year old one. It shaves more closely, is not irritating to skin (as they warn) and is very easy to keep clean by frequent washing in tap water. &lt;br /&gt;     It is also much quieter and very light weight, yet does not appear to be flimsy. Time will tell, but I am optimistic.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave with minimum amount of time. Just place under hot water for easy cleaning. Easy reading for amount of shave time left. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is the plastic head protector had a holder notch broken so it doesn&#x27;t stay on properly. Wrote for a replacement, but haven&#x27;t heard back yet. The company sent a new plastic head protector shortly after I wrote the review.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my son, but he tells me all the time how much he likes it. It replaced a Norelco he had and he says it is alot better.</li>
    <li> I am not all that pleased with the 9160 in that I always have to double-back over the entire neck to get all the whiskers it left behind. Makes one wonder \\&quot;what&#x27;s the point?\\&quot;. I am pleased with the smoothness of the shave above my chin line. The battery charge last over a week and it is a snap to clean. But my opinion is highly weighed against all of the whiskers that are left behind and therefore consider this a waste of my money. My current search is for a better designed shaver to replace it. Anyone want a free Norelco 9160XL?</li>
    <li> I was never a Norelco man, but two years ago I bought my first Norelco.  They are a little more spendy than other big name shavers so thats why I never bought one before.  Well I was pretty impressed with that Norelco.  I shave my head every other day so it has to be good!  I was very impressed with Norelco so when the 9160XL came out I waited for the reviews and they sounded good so I took the plunge and upgraded to the XL. Wow!!! I&#x27;m even more impressed with this one.  Great close shave and lasts a long time on a charge.  I&#x27;ve owned the XL for 6 weeks or so and only recharged it once.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to pay the $130. price tag for this great shaver.  I&#x27;m looking forward to a long relationship with this, my second, Norelco!  Might as well order a set of replacement blades for $30. at the same time. Enjoy your shaving experience!!</li>
    <li> Switching from blades, I&#x27;ve tried other electrics before.  This is as close to a blade as I&#x27;ve come.  No, it&#x27;s not as good as a blade, nothing is.  But how close a shave do you need on a daily basis.  It does the job for me, and is far more convenient and faster than a blade with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> it is better than my last electri shaver but not as good as a blade</li>
    <li> I bought my husband the Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch-XL Men&#x27;s Shaver for Christmas and he was so excited to use it.  The only bad thing I can say about it is, you have to let it charge for 4 hours before using it the first time, so he was dissapointed about that.  But honestly, he loves this shaver.  He doesn&#x27;t use a regular razor anymore.  It gets his face smoother than a regular razor ever would, and it&#x27;s also quiet.  You can barely hear it running.  This was definitely a great purchase, and purchasing it from Amazon.Com, I was very VERY surprised at how fast it got to my house.  Much faster than I expected even with the expidited shipping.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned!  I didn&#x27;t know it was possible to get this kind of shave without using a blade--highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for probably thirty years or more. This generation is, without doubt, their best yet. It gives a very close and comfortable shave, and no, it is NOT the equal of a blade. No electric shaver is. Two of the best improvements are the washable heads (I always washed out my Norelcos, but it was never recommended), and the improved battery technology, which permits this remarkably quiet shaver to go for weeks without a re-charge. Its ergonomics are excellent. It&#x27;s design is sporty and fun, and the tiny quartz clock, seeming frivolous at first, is a nice touch which I have come to rely on. Five-stars here, but there is one minor, annoying detail they dropped the ball on: It&#x27;s a challenge to get this thing back onto its stand, usually requiring several tries. Seems expensive - until you own it. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor as a replacement and upgrade for a previously owned, corded norelco razor.    This razor is as good as an electric razor gets. The foil cutters on competitors&#x27; razors are uneven and irritate my skin too much. This Norelco does a good job and is comfortable to use. The more consistently you use it, the better the results seem to be. I find that it works really well on my face but not as well on my neck. You can&#x27;t have it all, I guess. It still works well enough. The battery life is amazing on this thing -- no problem travelling with it. And it is nice to be able to rinse the razor under the sink to keep it clean.    Don&#x27;t bother buying the more expensive Norelco. The LCD screen is unnecessary.</li>
    <li> Cheap looking and cheaply made, does not deliver the close shaves advertised.It has an awkward and unstable stand and not two parts fit perfectly, besides its ugly design. I wish I had my old Norelco back.</li>
    <li> The razor quickly shaves close and is extremely easy to clean.  The battery holds a charge for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly researched shavers before I bought this one.  Consumer Reports was crazy for this model, and Amazon easily had the best deal available online.  My husband is getting a really clean shave--not easy for him--and says he loves it!</li>
    <li> Having always used a Remington, the recharable battery went  and I decided to try  this Norelco.  I am not unhappy, it has all the bells and whistles,indicating the amount of charge and when to clean.  It held the charge for almost one month.  It gives a good close chave.  The only criticism I have is the trimmer which is flimsy.  The circular cutting heads make it difficult to shave near the sideburns.  I have no difficulty recomending this model.</li>
    <li> The shaver is good.  It is awkward to plug the shaver into the stand. &lt;br /&gt;The stand has a useless clock in its base.  An automatic timer that would shut the charger off after the recommended one hour charge would be a  &lt;br /&gt;worthwhile substitute for the clock.</li>
    <li> good shaver , but i think the accessories should come free for all that money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Braun, two Remington&#x27;s (triple head and the regular), and nothing compares to this Norelco.  Not much else to say other than there is no comparison.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband based on the reviews for Father&#x27;s Day. He shaves both his face and head and does so with a disposable razor. This whole routine would take at least a half hour every two days and make a mess of the bathroom sink.  Now, he can sit on the couch in the living room, if he so chooses, and get that chore done while he watches a movie or reads to our sons.  It did take about 3 weeks before he really felt like he was getting a good, close shave, but we expected that based on the information included with the shaver and the reviews. He now loves it. Especially the convenience.  The battery life doesn&#x27;t last him near the month the product said it would, but he&#x27;s also covering a lot more area than most so that&#x27;s to be expected.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This razor didn&#x27;t shave as well as my 10 year old Norelco...so I returned it.  It actually hurt my skin, esp. under the jaw line.  I&#x27;m going to try a Braun next...if that doesn&#x27;t work, I might have to go back to manual razors?</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other comment before mine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Norelco 9885XL before. After five years, I decided to upgrade it. I am so disappointed with this later model. It does a poor job trimming the hair around the neck. I tried to slow down while trimming and hoping that it will trim the hair cleanly, it is indeed a futile effort. I wish I had my old Norelco but I already threw it away.  I am switching to Braun after this one.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with it four times so far. Each time takes a little less time. The first time it took me about 20 minutes because I have to break in my beard and skin. I have to learn the right technique to use it properly and quickly. The manufacturer states that it takes daily shaves for about 3 weeks before you can work up to a very good, quick shave. On the closest of 3 settings, the shave is remarkably close. It feels like it is as close as a conventional safety razor shave.    It has taken a little more time than I expected to clean and dry it after each use, probably because I am a new owner of the product. The last cleaning took about 5 minutes, which was not as long as the first time. It is very easy to clean because the moving parts can be rinsed and cleaned in running water. I like that. It feels very comfortable when I hold it.    I cannot say yet whether I would buy the product again, but I have no significant compaints so far.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and reliable performance. The pop-up rinse and clean shaving head makes it a breeze to keep it in good shape for the next shave. I&#x27;ve always liked the Norelco rotary shaving system but decided to try a more expensive, top rated foil shaver and it was no match for me. I ended up sending it back for a refund and purchased this Norelco instead. They say foil shavers offer a closer shave but not for my beard.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric to shave as close as a blade! I&#x27;ve had it for three weeks and still not had to charge it. Great razor works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this razor.  He says it is gentle on his face while giving him a great shave.  He loves the rechargeable base that it sits in.  Would definetly recommend to others.  The best razor he has ever owned.</li>
    <li> Please note that I live in Turkey and had provided you my in-law&#x27;s address for shipping all of the items purchased. I have not yet received the items I ordered. I will be happy to give you an evaluation when I do get them ( in about 2 months).   I wish you could ship them directly to addresses outside of U.S. at reasonable prices.  p.s. Since I had to rate the item in order for this review to reach you, I rated it one star although when I get it, it will be 5 stars!I hope.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 25 years and this is the best one yet.  The shaver is very quiet as compared to my older shaver.  Cleaning the shaver is much easier since I can rinse it.  The battery lasts a long time (week+) between charges.  I like the rubber grips as well.  The only problem I have with it is when shaving below the nose area.  It has a tendency to pull the hairs, maybe it&#x27;s because the heads rotate at a slower speed than my old one.</li>
    <li> I received this electric shaver as an end of year holiday gift on 25 November 2006. I have been quite pleased with the shaves that I get from it. My shaves are 90 to 95% as close as I would get with a blade with none of the iritation and skin abrasion that accompanies blade shaving. Additionally, my shaving time has been cut by 75%. As stated in the owners manual, it did take my face approximately three weeks to adjust - - - so if you have just accquired yours, be patient. You will see a noticable improvement after about a month or so. This unit has made my mornings so much easier to get through by eliminating my biggest personal Pain in the A## . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality of mine is excellent overall. It has been charged only once since the initial charge. I am currently obtaining 100 minutes (timed) out of the battery before needing to recharge. Cleanup is a breeze! It only takes a few seconds to rinse out the hair chamber and blades under hot water - - - then just let the thing air dry. Marvelous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made this such a great deal was that the local Wal - - - er, Megalo Mart was selling the 9160XLCC system with the Jet Cleaning/Charging stand for less than the advertised Amazon price of the 9160 alone. I use the cleaning function about twice a week, and just rinse out the shaver on the other days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different brands of electric shavers over the years (Norelco, Braun, Panasonic, Remington, Grundig, Wahl) and this one beats every electric that I have ever owned by far. Most Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time goes on, I will update this review - - - should any longevity or repair issues arise.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Shaves great-so quite-rinses clean. My last shaver was a braun-great shave -but sounded like a mini chainsaw! (I shave in a dressing room-shared by several people-they all thank me!) &lt;br /&gt;  Battery power is great-and there&#x27;s a clock in the charge stand!!! &lt;br /&gt;  Seriously-this is a fine shaver-at a good price! You will love it! (As in all electric razors-give it a few weeks for your skin to adjust)</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it. He gets a nice clean shave without the skin irritation of his old razor. It&#x27;s quiet and easy to clean. I would highly recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The one issue you&#x27;ll find with this razor is that it&#x27;s so quiet, you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s not doing anything.  Having gotten used to a Braun for a few years, I guess I had forgotten just how loud other razors are, compared to Norelco&#x27;s.  The Norelco is super quiet.  And like my Norelco from years ago, the battery lasts forever.  I also like the fact that you can use water to clean it out - instead of having to spend about $10 per month to clean the Braun.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will really last yet, but I must say, I&#x27;m back as a Norelco customer - for a long time!!!!</li>
    <li> smooth, ergonomically-friendly, low noise...i&#x27;ve been using all my life the conventional razor, but now I regret for not adapting Norelco since the old days</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good electric razor for years. I have skin that gets VERY irritated by blade shaving, It is a constant annoyance and I dread the coming of summer. Consumer reports recommended this razor (their reviews for women&#x27;s shavers weren&#x27;t good). I was hesitant to buy it because it can&#x27;t be used wet and I would typically use shaving cream with my Remington women&#x27;s foil shaver because it was too irritating when used dry.    That said, I am very happy with this razor. There&#x27;s no question that electric razors aren&#x27;t as close or fast as a blade but some of us don&#x27;t have a choice. It shaves pretty close with NO irritation (Shocking for me!) It really pays to shave as often as possible, the shorter the hair the closer/faster the shave. It takes a little patience and practice but is very gentle. I find the trimmer mostly useless but I don&#x27;t miss it much. It is also very easy to clean. A note though--be very careful where skin is loose, such as underarms (true with all electrics I&#x27;ve tried), it will make painful little scratches. Never had that happen on my legs though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday in June 2007.  He has used Norelcos for the last 30 years.  He says this one is wonderful, has a great close shave and is far better than his last one.  I have to agree with others who say the base and the clock on it are totally useless.  He just threw that away and plugs the cord directly in to the shaver to recharge and lays it on the bathroom counter as always.  Don&#x27;t know why they went to the trouble to make the base - seems pointless.  Anyway, the shaver is great!</li>
    <li> The product is very useful if you have sensitive skin like I do. It may take a little bit longer to shave, but I don&#x27;t have the red bumps under my chin like I used to from my old shaver. I also really like that they tell you how much battery power is left. I would occasionally have half-a-shaved face because my old shaver would die on me, but now I know when I need to recharge it, so it saves me a bit of embarrassment. :) If you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend and he loves it.  He said that it shaves incredibly close without irritation.  The best thing is that if he has any blemishes that day he can turn the sensitivity dial to avoid any bit of irritation.  The trimmer works fine and cleaning the shaver by rinsing is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for about 35 years now, never any other electric razor, and this is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I made a mistake and bought a cheapie Norelco at WalMart several months ago because of price, and immediately threw it out as soon as I got the 9160.    In any case, I love everything about it, EXCEPT for the plastic clam shell casing that it comes in.  What is Norelco thinking?  They should include a sharp pair of scissors, for free, with every purchase.  What a waste the packaging is.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s caregivers like this shaver and he always gets a clean shave.  No muss, no fuss, doesn&#x27;t have to get out of bed, zip, zip, he&#x27;s clean shaven.  A good dry shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver.  Adjustments for skin sensitivity are great (especially at first).  The trimmer on the back is a great little tool for sideburns and beards.  The battery lasts a long time on a single charge (two or three weeks) and it will let you know when it&#x27;s time for a recharge.  It also works directly from the charging cord.  The stand is nice but sometimes a little difficult to get it on there on the first try first thing in the morning.  Also, the travel case fits snug and protects well.  And since the battery lasts so long you don&#x27;t need to bring the charging cord on most trips.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He bought the Braun 360 complete but had to return it as it did not give a close shave. He exchanged it with the Norelco 9160XL and it works great. Even bought one for my dad who usually always finds something wrong. But no complaints yet and he has had it 6 months.</li>
    <li> This razor is very quite that is for sure. It is so quite, you wonder if it is working.  My old one was much more noisy but similar to this one and lasted about 7 years.   Old one finally died but I was very happy with it - time to upgrade!  I have been using this new one for a few weeks now and I have yet to have to re-charge it - it has only gone down one bar on the indicator so far.  Very happy with the charge it holds, very happy with the cut it provides and like I said - it&#x27;s amazingly quite.  I think that Amazon has the best price on this although for some reason - it took a long time to ship to me - 2 weeks.  I am very happy with the razor and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for 2 months now.  It gives a lot closer shave than my old norelco shaver that was about 15 years old or more and still worked fine until I dropped it.  The new one is so quiet that you can hardly hear it running.  I also like the cordless feature that elimanates the flopping cord while trying to shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He wanted an electric shaver because he is out in the oil fields sometimes for days and he can&#x27;t get in a decent long shower to razor shave.  He also can&#x27;t stand the feel of stubble growing for days at a time.  So after doing much research on electric shavers I decided this one was the best even better than some of the $200 ones.  To my delight my husband really likes this shaver.  Of course it does not shave as close as a razor, but what does.?  He is very happy with this and I found that Amazon had the best price on this specific model number.  I can only comment on what he has said to me about this shaver and going from that he gives it 5 stars and would highly recommend it.  This shaver has very easy clean up and has a real close shave.  By the way,  my husband shaves his head bald and he uses this shaver for that also.  So, for you bald headed guys he would recommend this when you can&#x27;t get in that razor shave.  The instructions say that if your skin is a bit irritated at first it takes time to get use to and to give it 21 days of only shaving with this shaver before you decide if you don&#x27;t like it.  Well, this is true.  It irritated my husband&#x27;s face at first because the shave was so close, but it only took a week and a half for him to fully get use to it.  He really likes this shaver.  The only reason he doesn&#x27;t love it is because even though you can rinse this shaver under running water to clean it you cannot take it in the shower with you.  My husband originally wanted a wet/dry shaver, but the trade in was that the wet/dry shavers do not shave as close, so he opted for the closer shave instead of the wet shave.  I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband for Christmas. He has very sensitive skin and has to be careful what type of razors/shavers he uses.  This shaver has been very kind to his skin and he gets a very smooth shave when he uses it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor i have ever bought for a man.It doesn&#x27;t pull hair and shaves real close.Washing it out is a plus. Every man should have one.+++++++++</li>
    <li> Very good product and the usual excellent Amazon service.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. I have used Norelco shavers for many years and this is by far the best. Quiet, comfortable gives a close shave and no pulling when there is a couple days growth. Easy to clean and maintain. Top notch!</li>
    <li> Having used the disposable razors now for 25 plus years i decided to try an electric razor again, given the fact your considered a terrorist if you have shaving cream cans in your luggage while traveling, the electric razor seemed like a viable solution. After much reviewing i decided to go with the 9160xl at christmas, it was almost march before i recharged it, and after a few days of use, i was used to how it works, its much faster to complete a shave, trim my mustache and gote, and off i go with no worries of water on my shirt, or shaving cream to wipe off. You can also shave while walking around as your not tied to the sink and running water to clear off the razor. The key to any battery operated device is to properly charge it when you first place it on the bathroom sink. And do not return it to the charger until the shaver shows low battery, that way you keep the battery life good. And yes its quiet. Does not sound like a small airplane nor does it make a high pitched whinning noise. Comments about not having power or cutting of skin are ridiculous, i have never had a problem, all i do is clean it out each use, and rinse the head out when the razor indicates it wants a water cleaning. Simple as that, follow the instructions, and youll be fine. Remember the key to the battery as that is the life of the razor, same rules apply to your cell phone.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.I am starting over with an electric shaver.You must stay with it to enjoy a close shave.It is very convenient to use and cleanup is vey easy.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well and I can shave much faster than with other shavers including top-rated Brauns. I am very satisfied in general but I have three criticisms.    1. The faucet \\&quot;clean the shaver\\&quot; light is useless coming on everytime I use it. I don&#x27;t clean shavers daily.  2. The charging stand, while attractive in appearance, does not make it easy to insert the shaver. You don&#x27;t need the stand to charge the shaver.  3. The carrying case has no dedicated place for the charging plug. Admittedly, the charged battery lasts for several weeks but I like to have the ability to charge it if I am on a long trip. It&#x27;s a nuisance to remember to charge the battery while packing.</li>
    <li> Amazon had this at a very good price, so I jumped on it.  I have an older Norelco, and this one wasn&#x27;t all that much more expensive than a new set of cutters.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost exactly a month, and it&#x27;s still got one bar left on the original charge.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day, sometimes twice a day.  The Speed-XL heads seem to work better than my previous 5 year old model.  It&#x27;s still not perfect, but I get a close shave, and I can shave again without fear of cutting myself.    I do have a few gripes, but they are rather small.  On several occasions I have released the head while shaving.  The button is just too easy to press on accident.  It&#x27;s no big deal, but annoying.  Also, the trimmer is spring loaded and pops out when released.  That&#x27;s fine, but you have to push it down when done.  I preferred my older model that had a thumb slide so I could easily extend or retract it with one thumb motion.  Also, the shape of the shaver prevents it from resting on it&#x27;s back.  I don&#x27;t really use the stand, and it tries to roll out of my medicine cabinet every time I set it down after using it.      It does use the same power adapter as my previous shaver, but the stand is slightly different.  And it comes with a semi-rigid case that looks great for carrying it while traveling, though it doesn&#x27;t hold the power adapter.    Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the shaver and would highly recommend it for anybody trying out an electric.</li>
    <li> I found the Phillips Norelco 9160XL to be absolutely wonderful. I have used it now for several weeks. It seems to need charging only about once a week, it gives a very nice shave and is very quiet. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for a long long time !     This is the best Norelco I have ever bought .     This multi flex head is quite an improvement to the shaver .  Using my old Norelco, compaired to this new one , is almost like shaving with a piece of wood .... the new one is that good !     The water clean - up is quite nice .   I find quite pricy !</li>
    <li> This machine is all right if you like to shave three times a day.  Otherwise, stick with your blade.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The famous pivoting heads do not actually pivot much, so upper neck, jaw and chin are a real challenge to trim.  And two hours later, you feel like you need a shave.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, the elaborate cleaning/oiling recommended by the User&#x27;s Manual will have you longing for the simplicity of your razor.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Further, the cost of replacing heads is a hidden cost.  Also, the need to purchase the oil and cleaning supplies.  They do not come with the machine.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the User&#x27;s Manual (even though labeled 9160 XL) does not square with the machine supplied.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re thinking of switching from razors to electric shavers, think again.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This new razor replaces my Norelco Tripleheader Speedrazor Model HP-1615 that I purchased in 1985 and has given me superb service for all these years without having to be serviced. But it had been making some loud clacking sounds lately and it does not give the close shave it once had. I did not want a razor that required me to constantly spend money on special cleaners, etc. I did not have to spend one penny on my 1985 model after I purchased it. Although it is early, I have been using it for only three weeks, it has done a great job. The original charging of the battery was fast. I have yet to recharge it in spite of daily use. It gives a very fast and very quite shave. I tend to suffer from red neck syndrome from shaving, but so far no problem with this razor. I have it on the sensitive setting and I still receive a close shave. Since this razor comes directly from Amazon, there is no problem in receiving it as with a third party supplier (Amazon uses either USPS or UPS, the only consumer friendly shipping people). My final decision to purchase this razor came after reading all the reviews, which I find invaluable. Consumer magazines only review items such as razors only once every few years. Kudos to Amazon for making the whole process painless and allow me to obtain a quality product.</li>
    <li> Simply put, THE BEST electric shaver I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve tried both Norelco &amp; Braun. Norelco always wins out. Braun shavers actually hurt and I have to keep going over &amp; over to get an unacceptable shave. Since the Braun I have owned Norelco&#x27;s which are very satisfactory. The 9160XL has exceeded my expectations. First of all its so quiet you can hardly tell its on. Secondly it shave&#x27;s smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It is THE closest shave from an electric razor. It shaves my face quickly and superbly. The battery charge lasts a very long time, about a month. Very easy to clean and maintain, just read and follow the instructions. I HIGHLY recommend the 9160XL!!</li>
    <li> Got mine about a month ago... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positives:  I&#x27;m still on my first charge, so battery is good so far.  Shaves slightly better than my older Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  The rubbery surface does not feel as comfortable as my old one in my hand.  Hair stubs get stuck on the rubber surface, and are harder to clean off. The entire blade assembly comes apart from rest of shaver - be careful when you first clean it, as I didn&#x27;t expect it and dropped it.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I often get a handful of hair stubs when I shave.  That&#x27;s kind of annoying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Considering that you can get an older model for half the price, I would say save the money and get a cheaper model.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Razor for my elderly father after alot of research into razors. It seemed to have all of the features he needed without being too complicated. He has always used an electric razor and said this is the best shave he&#x27;s had in years. I should add that he is not easy to please and I fully expected to be returning it! I.m glad he is enjoying it and that I got such a good value through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the service and the product. Being an old &#x27;crank&#x27;  that says a lot.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco finally gave up and the new was is even better.  Smooth and superior to the old model in every way.  I endorse this product.  The only negative is its cost.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors in the past.  Last time was about 10 years ago.  I gave it up because it got too hot and burned my neck.  I have been a Gillette Sensor shaver since then.  I use the twin blade, tried the triple blade a few times and didn&#x27;t like it.  I can&#x27;t imagine going to the 4 and 5 blade models. My problem with blades is they kill my neck.  I got into a pattern of shaving every other day in order to minimize the razor burn on my neck.  And of course, after the razor burn, there were ingrown hair issues.  I used the Gillette tube of shave gel for extra lubrication, which helped a lot, but still caused problems.  I also use dot shave in the shower, but trying to be water conscious, I started shaving a the sink again.  It didn&#x27;t take long to remember why I hated dealing with the mess that creates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After doing plenty of research, both on Amazon and consumersearch site, I landed on the 9160.  I had a really old Norelco that I used for a week until the new one showed up.  The old lift and cut system worked ok, but was much noisier and harder to clean than the new model.  The 9160 is extremely quiet.  I turned it on the first couple times and stared at it waiting for it thinking it was not \\&quot;up to speed\\&quot; yet.  It is just that quiet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see each of the blades moved/tilted independently as well as the head that tilted.  While that is cool and makes it a little easier to get the jawline and chin areas, I don&#x27;t think I could recommend stepping up in model and price for that feature.  The shave was close than the old lift and cut, but not close to what I got with the blades.   Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was close enough and what I expected, but you can&#x27;t really compare it to a blade.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The positive side, I shave everyday and have no ill side effects.  No razor burn, not even on my neck.  I use the normal setting.  No ingrown hair issues either.  There are 3 settings, if you need to go more sensitive, I just haven&#x27;t had to use it.  Cleaning is simple.  I shake it out and run hot water on it for a few second.  I don&#x27;t need to do this everyday, but it is recommended.  If you don&#x27;t want the pivoting head, you can get the same cutting system for a lot less.  I was able to get this for about 30% less than the regular price by shopping around, so I justified in my mind getting close to the top of the line.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I looked at the Braun and other systems that needed cleaning, and can not see why anyone would go through that hassle, especially since they all cost more. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers almost 40 years.  I can tell you this product gives me as close or a closer shave than any of my previous models.  That includes some very expensive foil models that plug into cleaning machines between shaves.  One of the best features of the 9160XL is that it is so quiet.  It is so quiet that at first I did not think it could be doing a very good job shaving.  I was associating a loud shaver with a close shave.  I was wrong.  This shaver gives you a close, smooth shave without all the noise.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver. Gives a very close shaver and the battery gives you a really large number of shaves so you only have to recharge once every few weeks.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product, and been using it for Approx. two months. Very smooth shave, battery holds charge for at least thirty days of shaving.   For the money I feel it&#x27;s a very good buy. It compares favorably with razors costing considerably more.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Ive I&#x27;ve known before how good this things were I would have buy one a lot of time ago.</li>
    <li> THE FACT IS RAZER IS BETTER BUT UNIT WORKS WELL THIS IS MY FIRST ELECTRIC UNIT I HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT THE OLD WAY RAZER BLADE AND SHAVING CREAM WITCH DOES GIVE ME A CLOSER SHAVE BUT ALWAYS THE CREAM CLOGS MY SINK  A LOT WITH THE ELECTRIC I HOPE MY SINK PROBLEM STOPS .</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver in the last 30 years...works as good as expected.  I like the battery power left display as well as the ability to clean it by running water on the cutting head.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace a Norelco Cool Skin Series shaver. I like the features and enhancements and can say that it is on par with my previous shaver, but with that said.....    Why even buy a new one. I like the shaver and it has a more modern appearance than the older, but the shave is roughly the same. No pun intended.     It is fairly comfortable but some of the features seem gimmicky and for all of the advances that the razor claims to have seem to fall short of the glory.    I can knock the razor completely. It does a decent job, has a quieter smooth operation, and holds a better charge than the previous razor. I will not be dismissing the Cool Skin from the lineup, but I certainly would have loved to have felt like that was completely necessary.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband for our anniversary this year and he loves it.  I bought it to replace his other shaver and he fell in love with it at first sight.  It has all these neat little features his other one did not have such as being able to choose the type of shave he wants.  He still has not figured out the clock feature but I told him he just needs to read the book.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor in 8/07 and it&#x27;s performing as expected.  It replaces my old 7886XL model.  The new one is faster and lighter than the old one; but, I&#x27;m not convinced that it cuts any closer.  I&#x27;d recommend it as a replacement but don&#x27;t go out and buy it if you don&#x27;t need a new one.  Oh yes, the charging base is a frivolous extra that I don&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Very good shave.  I have very sensitive skin and apperciate the SmartTouch feature. Faithful Norelco user for many years, but find new requirement to clean after each use somewhat irritating, expecially during morning rush. However, would recommend this product for its other fine features.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for about a month now and it gives you a very close shave without a lot of hassle. The only tough part for me to shave is the middle of my neck. I usually have to go over that a few times. Other then that its great. Pretty easy to clean, store, charge. Also, the sensitivity adjustment is a nice feature as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned norelcos in the past. This is the best of them. It has a closeness adjuster which really works. It provides a very comfortable shave and the cleanup is easy. What more could you want to accomplish a necessary but not always pleasant chore.</li>
    <li> I have thought that Norelco shavers were good. I have used this one, and it shaves as I expected. I have charged the battery once, and so far, it hasen&#x27;t been charged since. I am glad I bought this model, and it is easy to handle!</li>
    <li> My old Norelco severed me for almost 10 years and stopped working latterly since batteries are absolutely died. I decided to buy this one since it is a top model in new Norelco series and  got 1) so called &#x60;SmartTouch&#x27; Reflex Action System 2) rinse clean.    Now I have used it for over a month and feel a little disappointed. The biggest problem is the hair chamber isn&#x27;t very well sealed so while shaving the chopped hair will fly over on my hand, on floor. If don&#x27;t clean out the hair after use it can become very irritating on next shave (even rinse after each use still cannot totally keep it from happening).  Another thing is that SmartTouch, I have to say I cannot tell anything good about it except a feeling of fragileness.     Overall: it is a decent shaver and does its job. You HAVE TO rinse it clean EVERY TIME.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that makes it very difficult for me to use an electric shaver regularly. I cannot shave every day even if I use a good blade and take a nice shower. That being said, I use this electric shaver occasionally (like while I am on a trip and such). Although it is battery operated, I found the shaver powerful enough. It does irritate my skin a bit, but not more than I expected. And the shave is not as smooth as you would get using a good blade, but very close. It is far better than the other Philips I used long time ago. What I did not like is the charger base. I am sorry to say this Philips guys, but that thing is a joke.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth norelco shaver, I am 59 years old. This the best one yet. It is comfortable to hold and is very quiet. I have been shaving every day for the last month and it is still on it&#x27;s original charge. I really like that the razor heads are adjustable, not one size fits all.</li>
    <li> I change heads every 18 months.Daily clean the razor and the battery continues to last. Oh, the shaver is now in its 11th year without a problem. I still get a great shave.</li>
    <li> A very competent electric shaver.  You can rinse it out under a tap, which simplifies cleaning.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even buy it anymore in Amazon.  Maybe if you hunt?    Mine is about 10 years old.  Third or fourth set of blades.  Mostly I never rinse in water just blow it out.  Shaves close really close.  Not like a razor of course but this is about convenience right?  Those little orance cushions around the heads allow a smooth suspension.    Now comes one of the best parts.  Use it every day.  Battery lasts so long hard to say how long maybe three times a year?  Honest!!  Last January took a cruise for nine days without charger because it was just charged before.  Months after we got back it still had not reached the last light on the bottom after which the red light goes on saying to charge it.  This might be why the original price was pretty high.  Bought it on Ebay for way under a hundred.......  $78??    New blades and head are about $30 but they last for years.  Once in a great while I rinse with 90% alcohol and oil.  In my opinion water washing is not good for metal because the water sits in the head for days until it evaporates.  There might be some corrosion in that time.  Blowing or tapping is enough.      Best electric razor ever for me and it shows no sign of stopping after all these years.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift a couple of years ago, sufficient to say the shaver is still in great condition and it has provided many shaves for my husband.  It is easy to clean and really does a good job.</li>
    <li> Totally recommended. This is a real change, the previous models are all the same. The battery has a very long life and shaves excellent really. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have owned/used Norelco electric razors for 40 years starting with a \\&quot;double header\\&quot;. The 9160XL has surpassed my expectations!  I thought my prior units gave me  close shaves, but this one (Been using it for two months) really does feel like using a blade! Although many of the reviews &amp; Norelco&#x27;s literature warned against initial skin irritation, I had no problem, though I will assume that may be due to the fact that I&#x27;m a long-time electric razor user  (setting was \\&quot;normal\\&quot;).   &lt;br /&gt;I love that you can \\&quot;wash\\&quot; the heads clean under warm water. &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint/suggestion: The (included) travel pouch has no provision for the cleaning brush (included), and the cord (which, unlike previous models, has the transformer on the plug) that would have to be stored/packed seperately...Even though one charge lasts more than three weeks, Murphey&#x27;s law dictates that while travelling, one would need to re-charge the unit. &lt;br /&gt;I originally thought the clock in the (charging)base was  a waste; I have actually come to appreciate this \\&quot;nice touch\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy shaving w/ this razor &amp; I look forward to (at least)eight-ten years of faithful service. FYI: with the exception of the first (non-battery), I traded in old for new when the batteries needed to be replaced for a second time. I have always been satisfied with my Norelcos, and the 9160XL has set a new level of satisfaction...This is the new bench mark for all elecric razors. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> shaving is quiet, quick and efficient - could not ask for anything more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ditto ordering, billing and shipping.....</li>
    <li> It took a bit of time to get use to the floating heads but it shaves much better then my old stationary head Norelco 3 head shaver. &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for this type of shaver</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for the past 35 years and have always used their top of the line models. This time I used a middle level model and am absolutely thrilled with it. It shaves much closer than any previous model I have used. I purchased this model rather than the top one, based on previous reviews by this group and I concur with its superb performance at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 9160xl that I purchased from Amazon, was the best price that I was able to find. The shaver arrived quickly.  The shaver is performing even better than expected, having had Norelco&#x27;s in the past that I liked very much. The case is compact, good for travel, and since the shaver holds a charge for weeks (I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost 3 weeks already and the battery indicator is down only one bar out of 5)I don&#x27;t have to take the charging cord or stand with me on a trip. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to upgrade my lotion dispensing Norelco that&#x27;s now 5 years old.  The battery on it barely lasted one shave and it lived in its charging cradle except when drying.    Since I was so used to the old cradle and how it always was in it, I liked the little clock on this.  But once I noticed it lasts &lt; month the cradle is now a relic in my junk drawer!  It seriously only needs about an hour to charge fully so there is not any need for the cradle.  The tiny (not a huge brick that sticks in the wall) will fit inside the cradle or the razor.    When I first used my 9160XL I really irratated my skin, even being a long time Norelco user.  But it went away in about a week.  I still get red spots from irratation some times but heres my trick:  wait until BEFORE you shower because soap strips all the oils off your face, making it hard to glide or try using a TINY amount of shaving cream, spread so thin you can barely notice it and then go over with a splash of water.  If you use alot the Norelco could choke on all the extra cream and become less effective.  I hardly notice any differences in irritation when using the &lt;S N&gt; dial (sensitive or normal skin)    The trimer is neat but I only use it to shave my unibrow when I am too lazy to actually pluck the hairs out.  The trimer + the head array pop up with a flick of a finger.  I was used to pulling open the head like my old Norelco but this is spring loaded.  Some how when I was store drying it (the recommend to leave it wide open to air dry out the insides) the head came off.  I was frightend!  But it is designed to snap on and off easily.    The plastic head cover is working like it should.  I just prefer my old head cover more because it was easier to tell which side is going on the top.  But it is getting easier the top nub is alot smaller the my old one.  The travel case is awesome, fits it like a glove and zippers up.  Be sure to leave the cover on for double protection.    Be sure to look for a brush to cleanthe heads before you throw away the box.  The packaging is so complex it took me a while to extract all of it&#x27;s contents.    More cons:  - I don&#x27;t like how the heads are unprotected during air drying... I wish the cover would fit while its opened.  - Orange?  Bold color for something thats mainly blue, silver and gray.  - Maybe my drain needs draino but when washing out the chamber and heads alot of my hair gets stuck to the side of my sink, requiring splashing until it all goes.  But it&#x27;s kinda cool filling my sink the top then start draining and look up close at all tiny hairs it cuts.    I am been using this for 4 months now.    edit, now it&#x27;s been 5 years and the battery still holds a pretty decent charge.  Still working really well too.  Only replaced the blades once so I&#x27;d say I got my monies worth.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year Norelco user who also owns a five year old Norelco 6885XL which was the top of Norelco&#x27;s line when purchased. In my opinion the new Smart Touch line that uses the HQ9 heads is not worth the upgrade. I buy new heads once a year, which makes my older shaver feel like new. The only real reason to upgrade a Quadra/HQ7 Norelco is if the batteries are failing--and there are numerous places now where you can have your dying batteries replaced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for \\&quot;the latest is always better\\&quot; line.</li>
    <li> I got my husband this razor for his birthday in early April, 2007. He&#x27;d been complaining that he was having trouble getting a clean shave with his manual razor in hard to reach places. He&#x27;s been using the razor for over a month now and is very happy with it. While it takes him a bit longer to shave (he has to go over areas a number of times), it gets those hard to reach places far better than his manual razor did. He was very surprised and pleased about that. He said this morning that he&#x27;ll never go back to the manual.</li>
    <li> Having used Norelco/Philips razors for over 30 years, I have a plausible track record to state that this model is far and away the best one yet. Exceptionally quiet, super close, and being able to &#x27;rinse it out&#x27; makes cleaning it something I regularly do instead of the chore it once was. So far it has held a good charge and if it continues to do so, I will be very very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Close shaves, easy cleaning, and after a month, the battery is still at 3/4 charge!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco Razors for over twenty years. Each one I buy has improved technology, but this one has to be the best. I have never gotten a closer shave with a Norelco than I do with this razor. The three rows of blads makes a huge difference. My 5:00 shadow is more like what my 12:00 shadow used to be. Also, it is extremely quiet. Although, I have found that the razors get louder with age, unless my ears just adjust. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend upgrading to this razor or purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I have owned Remington and Norelco razors in the past, but I have always gone back to blades in order to get a smooth shave. But with the smooth shaves come the nicks and cuts. I decided to try again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am delighted and impressed with this razor. From first use it gave me a close shave comparable to a blade. Given the increasing cost of blades (the razor comes cheap, the fancy three, four and five blade cartriges are outrageous) the money spent for this razor is well spent.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas, and he is really enjoying &lt;br /&gt;it. The price on Amazon was terrific, which was helpful. &lt;br /&gt;The shaver leaves his face so smooth and it seems to feel that way &lt;br /&gt;a little longer than it did with his old shaver. (I like that!) The way the &lt;br /&gt;heads float seem to adjust to each area so well. This shaver is much &lt;br /&gt;quieter than his old shaver. &lt;br /&gt;He is impressed with the shaver and likes the way it holds a charge &lt;br /&gt;for more shaves.</li>
    <li> I got the 9160XL for Xmas.  I charged it up per instructions and put it on the shelf. The next day I grabbed it to shave, turned it on, and thought something was wrong because it is so quiet. I had used a corded Norelco for 10 years and was used to the noise. I went ahead and shaved with it and VOILA&#x27;. It is not only quiet, but it shaves really close. I&#x27;ve already put away the blade and gel I used for date-night.  No, it&#x27;s not QUITE as close, but the difference is neglgible. I was truly amazed at the shave. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now on the first charge, and the LED&#x27;s tell me I still have many more shaves left. It is an order of magnitude leap from the old corded Norelco. The only issue (a small one) is that it doesn&#x27;t like to go back on the stand; has to be lined up EXACTLY.  Again, it&#x27;s a minor complaint.  Santa Claus did real good.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from the 7864XL for a quicker shave.  This thing gives a fast &amp; close shave.  I love the 3 cutting heads.  No irritation whatsoever on the normal setting.  Even tackles the 3 day beard in under 2 minutes.  Occasionally there&#x27;s some stubborn neck hairs (if you wait 3+ days) that I have to pass over a few times.  I think the pivoting head isn&#x27;t needed at all so unless you just absolutely have the best the next model down may be the best bang for the buck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks now &amp; the battery status light just dropped one level.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the stand either, but with my old rotary I just plugged the power supply into it until charged &amp; then to the drawer it went until needed again (~1 month with previous model, probably 2 months with this one). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The blue looks like plastic in the picture but it&#x27;s anodized aluminum.  I&#x27;m pleased with the shave, the speed, &amp; the build quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Norelco 9160XL for almost a month now and I am very pleased with the close,smooth shave that it gives. In view of the fact that I&#x27;ve been getting a nice close shave with a twin blade razor and shaving oil for many years,I have been pleasantly surprised by the 9160Xl. The features that make this shaver special to me are how easy it cleans with water,how quiet it runs and the charge lasted over (3) weeks. The directions suggest shaving when your skin is dry and that works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever had. Great shave &amp; total comfort. Buy it &amp; you&#x27;ll love it. I have brought Norelco (now Philips) for thirty years &amp; this is the best ever. Wash it off &amp; it&#x27;s clean as a whistle. After full charge it lasted me a month. 5 ***** (stars)   Mike</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 9160XL with hesitation because I have always used a foil shaver or razor.  Initial impression of the 9160XL was about the same as other users.  I liked the quietness but was not sold on the shave.  After using the shaver for a month, I am now really quite happy with most features the shaver offers.  It is quiet, shaves fairly close (probably comparable to the foil shaver), good battery life, easily cleaned with warm water, trimmer works well, and it seems more gentle than my foil shaver.  The skin on my neck seems to get nicks easily and the 9160, with some practice, nearly solves that problem.  The only MAJOR negative side is that the shaver cannot be left plugged into the charging stand or the cord plugged into the razor without damage to the battery.  I do not like the idea of closely monitoring when the charge is complete.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two other Norelco&#x27;s. An older 7885 with just straight slots in the heads (but lift and cut). and one with the combination of shaped slots in the head. This new one works better than both. It&#x27;s quiet. It holds a charge for a long time (I will get over 30 days on a charge). It cuts long whiskers as well as any of the earlier ones, and cuts closer than the earlier ones. I can get a good shave in a little less time than with the 7885 and a lot less time than with my last Norelco with the combination slots (sorry I threw that one away as soon as I got this new one and don&#x27;t remember the model number). Once you learn how much pressure to use, there is little irritation, the same or less than with the earlier models. I found the spring adjustment in the head to be fine at the default setting, so the \\&quot;more sensitive\\&quot; settings won&#x27;t be useful to me. It seems well made. It&#x27;s a little flashy, especially the orange accents that I don&#x27;t prefer. The one gripe i have is it has a converter in the cord and the cord is straight (both of my earlier ones had coiled cords which I prefer). My 7885 has the charger built into the razer so it just had a cord. But given it holds a charge for so long, I can accept that. I will not use the charging stand - it just takes up space. The razer is made in Europe, so hopefully the quality is good. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a good electric razer.</li>
    <li> After using a Braun, Panasonic, and a Norelco (with only single blades) I thought I would try the new design with 3 blades in each of the three heads.       The best feature of the Braun was the ability to lock the on/off switch when traveling.       I bought the Panasonic because of the Linear motor.  It also had the fastest motor speed.  It doesn&#x27;t get slower as the battery drains.  I think the motor was actually too fast to get a great shave.       My old single blade Norelco (8894XL) is great.  The motor seems too slow at first and the shave takes a little longer, but I liked the results and the way it looks and feels.  It was time to replace the blades again, so I decided to go for newer technology.       The new one (9160XL) has more shaving surface and is quieter.  It doesn&#x27;t have a digital readout like my last one, but it can work with a cord if I don&#x27;t re-charge it in time.  It still has that great Norelco feel.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any faster, but I get a better shave in the same amount of time.  I need to re-charge it about once a month.  I checked around for price.  Amazon won by $30.</li>
    <li> For a better price I bought waterproof shaver ( Norelco) which has a better recharger (heavier and stays more stable on the counter)  Extra LED s for battery condition is really not necessary and it probably consumes more battery power..</li>
    <li> Both the shaver and its shaving system are terrific.  The shaver gives a close, comfortable and fast shave. Also,I save much time by not putting lotion on my face before the shave as was required by the old system.  In turn, the lotion tended to clog up the razer heads, which had to be thoroughly cleaned following each use. The new system only requires a dry and clean face.  The maintenance on the shaver can be limited to once a week.</li>
    <li> The product was as described.  It is the second best Electric Razor I have ever owned.  The other was also a Norelco.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor a little over a month ago.  I am very pleased with the product and would definately recommend it to all my family and friends.  I had an older model Norelco Electric Razor that I thought performend well. When I used this razor for the first time, I was blown away.  It shaved me as well or better than a blade, without the irritation.  There are more expensive electric razors on the market.  Go ahead and buy one if you want to waste your money.  This by far is the best and most affordable electric razor on the market.  Thank you Norelco for producing such a wonderful product.  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> The product works wonderfully for mu husband! The service is as good as the quality! Highly recommended . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco for about a month now.  I had previously used the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite (stolen out of my luggage at the airport), so I will use that as a basis for comparison.  I have somewhat sensitive skin; I did go back to a Gillette Fusion razor for a month in between electrics.    Cost:  $129 Panasonic  $80 Norelco (Sale Price)    Aesthetics:  The Norelco is a better looking razor imo, with a nice charging base.  The clock is a cool feature.  Norelco looks better on the counter.  Norelco is much quieter than the Panasonic.     Features:  Both had sensitivity settings and LCD battery monitors.  Found the sensitivity settings helpful for the initial break-in period on both.  Panasonic was wet/dry.  Norelco is not.  Norelco comes with a nicer travel case.    Break-in:  Panasonic took two weeks before redness subsided.  Comfort level was fine.  Redness subsided after a week with the Norelco.    Comfort of Shave:  After the break in period both provided a comfortable shave with little or no irritation.  The Norelco will catch and pull a hair once in a while but its not a big deal, but I have to be careful around my lips with the Norelco or it will pull and cut them.  That didn&#x27;t happen with the Panasonic.    Closeness of Shave:  Panasonic wins hands down, its not even close.  With the Norelco I&#x27;ll have to do a touch up at night (after morning shave) if I want clean shave look.  Wasn&#x27;t needed with the Panasonic.    Ease of Shave:  Panasonic wins again; much quicker shave.  So far I&#x27;m not a big fan of the rotary style.  I have to go over area&#x27;s multiple times, and its tougher to get the tight/close spots.  Shaving takes at least double the time with the Norelco.    Battery:  Norelco has a longer battery life, however you have to be careful not to overcharge it.  You can&#x27;t just leave it on the charger and go to bed; you have to remove it when its fully charged, or you&#x27;ll damage the battery.  A big pain if you ask me.  Didn&#x27;t do this with the Panasonic.    Cleaning:  Panasonic was wet/dry, Norelco is not, but both can be cleaned simply by running under water.  Really not much different.    Value:  I wish I had gone for the more expensive Panasonic again, but the Norelco does a good enough job that its not worth buying another razor.  I would probably think the Norelco was great if I never had used the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I did a great deal of research before I finally ordered this shaver.  I&#x27;ve been delighted at how smooth, quiet, and fast it has performed.   I&#x27;d considered a foil-type at my son&#x27;s recommendation but stuck with my   Norelco rotary and it is much better than my previous one. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary razors for years, I can&#x27;t really see/feel a difference in the upgraded blades for this model but it does follow the contours of my face better than my older Norelco&#x27;s allowing for reduced shavings time.  This model tends to collect hair/dirt more easily than other models and needs to be cleaned more often.  The faucet light that reminds you to clean the razor is unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic cover that fits over the blades broke within a week.</li>
    <li> great shaver never had electric before this one and I am 61 yrs young. Charge seems to last forever. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for his birthday and so far it has been working fine.  He likes it and it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I got this Norelco 9160XL to replace my old (25+ yrs) corded Norelco.  This \\&quot;newer\\&quot; model is everything I expected.  Provides a close shave, trimmer does the job.  Easy to clean.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco 9160XL electric shaver gives a nice close comfortable shave. Another feature is that the shaver indicates how much charge is left before it needs recharging,it is also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have the second toughest beard on the planet. Right behind Bigfoot. I let my beard go from Thursday until Monday morning. My shaver arrived Saturday. This would be the test to end all shaving tests. I was shocked to get such a close shave from an electric shaver. I just had never bought one as my beard is so tough to cut and I figured an electric shaver would never work on my beard. Even with my razor, it takes a couple swipes in some areas of my face and neck. I did need to run over the same areas a few times with the shaver to get it all, but it worked like I never beleive it could. My shave was very close to razer close. There was only mild skin irritation after shaving, but I get that regardless even with a razor. I am so done with my 5 blade razor and shaving cream mess. No need to ever go back. I&#x27;ll give my razor and shaving cream to Bigfoot and keep my electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Carnig, my husband, liked everything about this razor--in fact he really would like a new head for it--so he could still continue to use it !!!</li>
    <li> OK, I just bought this shaver and so far, it&#x27;s turning out wonderfully.  This is by far the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The way the razor glides over your face with practically zero irritation and razor burn is just phenomenal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the second Norelco rotary I&#x27;ve used.  The first time, I tried the Coolskin 7775x and although it gave me a really close shave, it irritated the hell out of my skin and gave me quite a bit of razor burn aswell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From then on though, I knew that I would try another rotary.  Rotaries seem to work well on my face, particularly on the hair below my jaw line. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;m glad to say that the 9160XL shaves FASTER, CLOSER and WAAAAYYY more comfortable than the Coolskin.  I never tried a Spectra though, so I can&#x27;t compare the two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The greater speed and closeness is due to the new razor heads.  The new shaving heads have THREE times as many blades as the older Norelco models (including Spectra), and equally as important, more holes and slots (especially holes) aswell which equal up to 50% greater surface area being covered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the comfort level, Norelco&#x27;s new Smart Touch feature enables the entire razor head to flex almost 360 degrees.  It also has three personal comfort control setting ranging from sensitive to normal, and inbetween. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is why the shave is so smooth and comfortable.  It&#x27;s a massive improvement over the Coolskin models, but over the Spectra I&#x27;d say it would be minimal based on what others have said because the Spectra is supposedly \\&quot;super\\&quot; comfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m highly impressed with Norelco&#x27;s new offering and I feel they did an excellent job addressing some of the weaknesses of rotaries, such as shaving really short stubble by the addition of more holes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5 Stars from me!</li>
    <li> I must say this is the best shaver that I&#x27;ve had, shaves pretty much like a blade shave only less irritation. I had a Quadra before and upgraded myself to this shaver. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve used the 9160xl and it&#x27;s been good so far. I did have a couple of weeks adjustment phase even though I was using my Quadra (maybe the technique I use). It was irritating in the cheeks area initially but now have got adjusted, it&#x27;s cool. The major improvement is in the jaw and neck region, not at all irritating and the sensitive modes do help. I think the Smarttouch is a plus than the SpeedXL models (again that is at a personal level), I feel it&#x27;s easier on the wrist.</li>
    <li> I have bought Norelco\Phillips before.   I have always been happy with them.   I have found them to be very reliable.   This is a very good electric razor.   I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best decisions I have made! I have been a Gillette Sensor Excel man for YEARS!!! I tried electric razors before...they were garbage! The 9160 XL is the exception and it is AMAZING!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have heavy, thick facial hair too. For me, every day was a drag. I have a professional white collar job, so I MUST SHAVE! Yuck. Every day, the same long, laborious process. Take a hot shower to soften things up, apply shaving cream and let sit for a few minutes to soften the hair further, shave, then shave again. THIS IS OVER! NO MORE !!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are tons of reviews here on this razor that say it all. I cannot do better. However, I will share some important details with you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1 - This razor is about $120-$165. It is worth it.  &lt;br /&gt;2 - I bought a refurbished model for $85. It works just fine! But I only have a 90 day warranty. &lt;br /&gt;3 - This razor is VERY quiet. &lt;br /&gt;4 - This razor does a great job and gets very close to the skin. &lt;br /&gt;5 - The instruction manual says you need to give yourself and the razor 3 weeks to adapt. IT IS TRUE! My shaves got better after the first week, then every day there after my skill and confidence grew. I am at 4 weeks now and I don&#x27;t get irritation, my skin is fine and the cut is close. In my first week I got irritation, I did not hold or stroke the razor properly. &lt;br /&gt;6 - YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT. Give it a month at least. Do not cheat and use a blade! I was patient and have been well rewarded. &lt;br /&gt;7 - This razor is EASY TO CLEAN!!!! &lt;br /&gt;8 - I went 3 weeks sometimes using the razor 2 times in a day and did not have to recharge it until the beginning of the 4th week. &lt;br /&gt;9 - It runs nice, does not get hot and hardly even vibrates. &lt;br /&gt;10 - Very light and easy to pack for traveling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars but this is my first electric razor. I don&#x27;t know what a 5 star electric razor is like. This probably is one!</li>
    <li> My husband had a cheaper cordless Norelco, and he was constantly annoyed with it for not being powerful enough. This was his Valentine&#x27;s present from me, to reduce a morning stress point, and it has worked like a charm. We still have plenty to stress about in the mornings, while getting three kids and ourselves out the door, but shaving isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit about 1 week ago and I&#x27;m extremely please thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-light weight, and easily portable; comes with a small, snug fitting pouch for travel storage/protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-long battery life; still fully charged since my initial charge up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-fits comfortably into the hand and is not \\&quot;slippery\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the three flexible, triple layered \\&quot;floating\\&quot; heads give a great shave...close and smooth; as good as I could have hope for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-shaving head is washable while on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-only one really, that being that the entire shaving head doesn&#x27;t separate from the unit (for cleaning purposes)as with some previous models; instead it has a fliptop (like a cap on a  ketchup bottle). Although there is nothing specifically wrong with this, it does appear to be somewhat \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; to say the least. (one accidental knock or mishap and its easy to conceive the shaving head being knocked askew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver is an upgrade from many years of mid-range Braun models, and I&#x27;m an enthusiastic switcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outstanding improvements are quiet operation, long battery life (still on the first charge after nearly a month), and the unit is lightweight and requires only a light touch to get the job done - the tilting floating heads work very well.</li>
    <li> I switched from a foil shaver to the 9160XL.  I could not be more happy.  Great shave, smoothe and more comfortable than the foil.</li>
    <li> I used to hate electric shavers because they irritated my skin. My neck and upper lip would always turn red after shaving with electric shaver. Well... not anymore! I have been using this one for about one month, and have not experienced any irrtation, even on first trial. The shave is pretty smooth, good enough for when you are in a hurry. And the best thing of all.... it&#x27;s so easy to clean. Just put in under running water for a few seconds, and you are done. No mess!! Don&#x27;t have to deal with little brushes, or having to blow on the thing sending little \\&quot;hair dust\\&quot; all over the place, and having to clean the sink, the counter, etc. I love the convenience and easyness of the cleaning process.  &lt;br /&gt;Another advantage, when it&#x27;s fully charged, it will go for around 30 shaves without having to re-charge. So it&#x27;s perfect for travelling. You don&#x27;t need to carry the charger with you. Just charge before leaving, and you can go for about one month without problems.  &lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, this unit has changed my view and experience with electric shavers. No irritation, good shave, super easy cleaning, no mess, and good for travel. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors my entire adult life, and they&#x27;ve never been perfect.  Prior to the 9160XL, I owned a relatively modern design, a 3-head 4865XL stamped with logos like \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; and \\&quot;micro action.\\&quot;  I was grousing to myself about the random hairs my old razor left, which occassionaly prompted a \\&quot;you missed a spot\\&quot; comment from my wife.  Typically in the corners of my jawline, but now and then I&#x27;d notice that some hairs on the easier to shave areas, like my cheeks.  Neck hairs of course were always a problem.  I purchased the 9160XL in the hopes that the 3 concentric cutting rings on each head would fix that problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My initial reaction to using the 9160XL was a bit underwhelming.  It seemed there were still hairs that I had to run over multiple times at different angles, trying to find the magic gesture that would lift it up enough to cut it.  True, it was much quieter, and my skin did smoother than before, indicating a closer shave, but I thought perhaps that was my imagination. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In truth, it does shove significantly closer than my old razor.  One recent evening, my wife asked me if I&#x27;d just shaved.  It was at least 12 hours after I&#x27;d shaved, and my skin felt roughly as smooth as it did immediately after shaving with my old razor.  I do have bristle that&#x27;s evident to the touch the next day, but it&#x27;s not visible like it was after 24 hours as it was before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being able to clean the razor under the tap is a big advantage too.  Electric razors generate tiny little hairs that behave like a fine powder, and which stubbornly stick to surfaces inside the razor through any amount of dry cleaning.  Running the heads under water is much more effective, and much easier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are some other minor improvements, like the fact it&#x27;s quiet, and the battery charge lasts 4 times as long, at a guess.  Neither of those is terribly important to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a magic wand, though, which is why it doesn&#x27;t get a prefect score from me.  As I said, some areas still require multiple passes, and bristle on the neck is never perfect.  But it&#x27;s still a step up from what I was using before, so I don&#x27;t regret spending the money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; - Gus</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco razors for over thirty years.  I just bought this one and think it is great.  It gives an outstandingly close shave. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor for over 30 years, and for most of the time they have been Norelcos. The Braun that I had didn&#x27;t get the job done quickly enough, so I&#x27;ve been loyal to Norelco. When the old Norelco was 6 years old, it was time for a change. The new 9160XL Smart Touch is quicker, provides a closer shave and holds it charge longer than any previous Norelco that I have owned. When it&#x27;s time to replace this one, I hope Norelco has come up with a new model that is even better than the 9160XL. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 30 years. This one gives me the closest shaves of any - is surprisingly quiet and capable of cleanly shaving the hardest to get neck whiskers.  The long battery charge life is another big plus for a traveling man.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Norelco that I&#x27;ve had for about 30 years.  It finally died.  The 9160XL is a better shaver.  It gives a much closer shave and is a lot quieter.  So far, the battery life is very good.  I like being able to wash the cutter head in water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a Norelco Advantage (6 years old) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days.  I can&#x27;t honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because I haven&#x27;t shaved with a blade in many years.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    I have used foil shavers in the past (Braun and Panasonic) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    I have been using this shaver for about 3 months.  During that time I have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day.  At first I thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old Advantage which I thought was doing a great job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   It shaves quick and close ( Personally I think as close as a blade).  When you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry. It doesn&#x27;t get any easier than that. I have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    The only con is I have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings. Use electric shave before shaving and I think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended and worth the price.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Quieter, faster, closer, smoother ... this shaver does it all - in spades.  I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver all my life and have tried nearly every brand and type, including those made by Braun and Remington.  I&#x27;m here to tell you that, in my opinion, nothing matches what this shaver can do.   It literally glides across my face, catching every whisker in its path.  Even those hard to reach areas just under your nose are nothing for this puppy.  The only things I dislike about it are the accessories, which are cheaply made and mostly unnecessary.  But, you know what?  I bought the 9160XL hoping it would shave me better.   And I can honestly say that I&#x27;m amazed at the shaves I&#x27;m getting.   Sometimes, we really do get what we pay for.  Kudos to Philips Norelco for a job well done!</li>
    <li> l have owned norelco shavers for over 30 years. the one l had finally gave out. l saw this 9160 and l bought it. it is everything the article says it is. l am very pleased with it. it deserves another star l think.if you purchase this l am sure you will be pleased with it as l am.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed in the primary function of this shaver. It doesn&#x27;t shave well! I have to go over areas of my face numerous times before it gets the bulk of the whiskers. I STILL have to use a manual razor for too much of the detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand that the unit slides into for charging is annoying. I usually have to pick up the stand and \\&quot;eyeball\\&quot; the unit on to the charging prongs. Poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feature is great and the cleanup is easy.</li>
    <li> It is a great razor. I had to get use to it shaving so close. It slightly irritaed my skin a little. I love it and it holds a charge for a while. Worth the money. Norelco makes a great razor.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this item after reviewing both customer reviews and CONSUMER REPORTS. This shaver is all it was said to be and in my opinon MORE. Very comfortable, smooth close shave. In all honesty, BUY ONE!</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver, quiet and painless, with good battery life, and a reasonbly close shave, but hardly the \\&quot;revolutionary development\\&quot; that Norelco touts.  If you need a new one this is a good choice, but I would not throw out an old Norelco rotary  that works well just for the upgrade.  The charger stand is pretty much unnesessary, and useless for travel, since you can plug the recharging cord directly into the razor.  The little analog battery clock is a cute touch if you don&#x27;t have a larger clock in your bathroom.  But a serious drawback is that the travel pouch does not have room for the power cord, meaning you have to leave it home, and hope the charge lasts the length of your trip.</li>
    <li> Quiet, nearly noiseless. You can actually hear it when its shaving. Fast too.  Easy to clean. Get this one, the 5 LEDs model 9160xl is the best value for the buck. The yearly head replacement indicator is nice too. I could not tell a difference between this and the Braun 360 closeness wise. The Braun is so loud, you can&#x27;t tell -hear- if you&#x27;re actually cutting barely visible whiskers or not. I&#x27;m giving this four stars instead of five, only because I&#x27;d SWEAR I got a closer shave with the Norelco 7140 from Walmart which use the HQ8 heads.</li>
    <li> I have used over 5 different models of electric razors in the past decade, looking for the cream of the crop: I have think I&#x27;ve found it!  This shaver had good online reviews so I purchased it and it was well worth the money. It takes a little bit of time to get used to your face (about a full month for me) but after it did it was quite a close shave, approaching the closeness of even a manual blade. Other positive things about this model are that it is easy to clean and has a great internal battery (fully charging in less than an hour). LED lights on the front come on after each use and remind you to rinse the razor head under the tap while also reminding you of how much battery life is left. A sturdy stand to keep your razor upright while not in use is also included.</li>
    <li> So glad i read reviews, here and elsewhere, of this and many other products before choosing this one. Great! well worth the price, for many reasons! Firstly, it shaves closely, then it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, lasts a long time after charging, and finally pretty quiet. i&#x27;m new to it, and it to me, but we&#x27;ve become quick friends. i recommend it, and it&#x27;s worth the &#x27;cheap&#x27; price!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Norelco 9160xl and am extremely happy with it.  I was using a Braun.  It shaved ok but left long hairs.  The Norelco gives a smooth close shave and very comfortable.  I especially like that it indicates how much charge is remaining which is very nice if you are traveling without the charger.  The Braun simply quit when charge wore off.</li>
    <li> Shaves smoothley, it arrived fast and it works great. very satisfied and recommend it especially for people with sensitive skin. it really gave me a good shave. i use to shave only once a week with my old shaver becasue it gave me a bad rash everytime, but with this model i shave almost three times a week and it works great.</li>
    <li> Like most of the other reviews it seems to bean improvement over older electric razors I used in the past. Unfortunately, no matter what I try it still seems to miss getting the hair on your neck and under the corner of your job. This is a good buy if you want something to clean up quickly during the week but still do a weekly shave with a straight razor...at least that is what I am doing now.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor almost five years ago with high expectations. One thing I soon found was that getting the hairs at the lower part of both sides of the  front neck was hard as well as not pleasant. I also found that the trimmer was best to cut the hairs leading down my chin&#x3D;&#x3D;center part of the neck.  There was a visiting shaver repairperson coming to our town and he cleaned it twice.  I replaced the blades three times.&lt;br /&gt;But this is a razor that needs to be cleaned at least annually. Now I feel&lt;br /&gt;my razor is ready for the junk heap. Also some of the small hairs around the chin have to be reshaved.  It is a good razor but now seems to be obsolete. It charges quickly and some of the hairs can be removed  by  putting the head in some hot water.  Yet the razor still should be&lt;br /&gt;disassembled monthly to get the heads clean. With shaking hands this was a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Works great holdsa charge a long time</li>
    <li> Useless cleaning system. Battery not replaceable and runs down to where it needs a total recharge frequently.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 20 years now. I do so because I do like the ease and comfort of the shave by Norelco products. But here is the bottom line. Every year without fail the razor quits and I have to get another one. I am sure I am not the only one experiencing this. There is no doubt in my mind the product is designed to fail one to two years out. I have decided to make a switch to braun or another product and recommend whoever reads this does the same.</li>
