      <li>BEST SMELL EVER.</li>
      <li>Excellent ,..thanks,..</li>
      <li>Its perfect.</li>
      <li>Best curve cologne ever.</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>Great price&lt;br /&gt;Quick</li>
      <li>a great gift&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
      <li>Smelled great</li>
      <li>Smells great, Nice packaging.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, so</li>
      <li>I already own a bottle of this cologne and thought I would get another for a gift for a friend.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>the price is ok for the bottle size.</li>
      <li>I love the cologne itself though.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, but I think I get most of the benefits out of it.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>He loves it, I love he smells good, &amp; we got it fast.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my boyfriend without knowing the perfume, i was happy that he loved it, and i did too because is not strong but</li>
      <li>Stick with the original Curve and skip this variation.</li>
      <li>This was a gift and it was apparently a huge success.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a sweet, fruity aroma here, but lots of undertones.</li>
      <li>Bought the scent without previously trying it- great summer/casual cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible scent, it just pales in comparison to the original Curve and has a completely different smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s less strong than that, and I think I like this better.</li>
      <li>Also bought the &amp;#34;Curve Connect&amp;#34; with this, and it came in a much larger bottle for a cheaper price, but other than that, the cologne is great.</li>
      <li>The product is greatly appreciated.  </li>
      <li>light smell and last for a while.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a Curve product that I didn&#x27;t like, and I have three different kinds: original, Crush, and Soul, which is a little more understated than the other two.</li>
      <li>Even so, the scent is fairly disappointing in it&#x27;s own right, and it is pretty weak and doesn&#x27;t last very long at all (few hours at best).</li>
      <li>Curve Crush was very disappointing and it is not as good as the original Curve.</li>
      <li>If you are like me, and you were looking for something similar to the original Curve but with a little bit of a twist then this is not for you.</li>
      <li>Apparently there was an error on the label.</li>

    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend without knowing the perfume, i was happy that he loved it, and i did too because is not strong but light smell and last for a while. the price is ok for the bottle size.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and it draws women attention like crazy.  I only wear this on special occasions because I&#x27;m afraid of wasting this and not having it when I really need it.  Not better than MAMBO which has its on phermone powers but it works around the ladies.</li>
    <li> I already own a bottle of this cologne and thought I would get another for a gift for a friend. I ordered this and waited several weeks. Apparently there was an error on the label. Whoever they DID deliver it to, rejected the package.    I love the cologne itself though. It smells amazing, so I couldn&#x27;t give it a bad review for a shipping error!</li>
    <li> Definitely a sweet, fruity aroma here, but lots of undertones. I haven&#x27;t tried a Curve product that I didn&#x27;t like, and I have three different kinds: original, Crush, and Soul, which is a little more understated than the other two.</li>
    <li> Best curve cologne ever.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it was apparently a huge success.  The product is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your help.</li>
    <li> This sort of reminds me of Jake from Hollister. It&#x27;s less strong than that, and I think I like this better. It doesn&#x27;t always seem to last all day though.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, and you were looking for something similar to the original Curve but with a little bit of a twist then this is not for you. Curve Crush was very disappointing and it is not as good as the original Curve. It&#x27;s not a terrible scent, it just pales in comparison to the original Curve and has a completely different smell. Even so, the scent is fairly disappointing in it&#x27;s own right, and it is pretty weak and doesn&#x27;t last very long at all (few hours at best). Stick with the original Curve and skip this variation.</li>
    <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Quick Shipment&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great gift&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to purchase again&lt;br /&gt;A a a a</li>
    <li> Bought this for the DH. He loves it, I love he smells good, &amp; we got it fast. Very satisfied. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my Dad for Christmas, one of his favorites and he like it. Smells great, Nice packaging.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Smelled great</li>
    <li> BEST SMELL EVER. I bought this for my boyfriend, but I think I get most of the benefits out of it. :) He likes it a lot. The smell is not musky or over powering. Its perfect.</li>
    <li> The picture is of a single bottle of cologne.  It is actually a set with body wash, cologne, etc.  I was not interested in purchase anything other than cologne.  Disappointed in what I received.  Picture is deceiving.</li>
    <li> Also bought the &amp;#34;Curve Connect&amp;#34; with this, and it came in a much larger bottle for a cheaper price, but other than that, the cologne is great.</li>
    <li> Bought the scent without previously trying it- great summer/casual cologne.</li>
    <li> Everyone I encounter loves this cologne. Will be buying a bigger bottle soon!</li>
    <li> Excellent ,..thanks,..</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
