      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the ladies checking me out more since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily with the supplied brush.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>easy to use,and easy to take off.</li>
      <li>but this is easy</li>
      <li>So easy to use , just apply it by brushing it ..</li>
      <li>The dark brown color is a perfect match for me.</li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>Convenience, natural looking, easy to apply &amp; good results.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wear white shirt, but m happy.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have a heavy beard it might not work as well but for my stubble and sideburns it is perfect so thumbs up blackbeard.</li>
      <li>Great product m using this been last</li>
      <li>a light touch with the brush</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it every day, but it might work for you for special occasions.</li>
      <li>Blackbeard needs to be applied every day but there&#x27;s no bad itching reaction..</li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>It goes on pretty easy</li>
      <li>Other than that, worked great</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you keep it on you as daily activity will eventually rub it off a bit so you&#x27;ll need a quick reapply depending on the location.</li>
      <li>the applicator works great because it&#x27;s small</li>
      <li>Then, use a soft full size hair brush to spread the color through the beard so it looks more natural.</li>
      <li>The black blends pretty good with my hair color</li>
      <li>it would go very fast.</li>
      <li>and I like to go light because it looks more natrual than heavy.</li>
      <li>If I would make a suggestion so that EVERYONE uses it, make the size a little bigger, I know you need and should make a profit, but it would be nice to have a little extra, but yea great stuff!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>it takes seconds to apply &amp; dries just as fast.</li>
      <li>and really i have no complaints.</li>
      <li>Very simple but so effective, looked younger instantly.would highly recommend to all my friends, in seconds natural looking coloring with just a hint of grey , huge difference!</li>
      <li>And easy to touch up after a long day!</li>
      <li>I found the main brush a bit too much</li>
      <li>Product was shipped and received quickly, in had been using another product that lasted 3-5 days but took 10 minutes to apply, the 30 second application was what I was looking forward to.</li>
      <li>First application was a failure, it was clumpy and after working 10 minutes to get it looking half-way right it easily wiped off on my clothing.</li>
      <li>Yea it&#x27;s great stuff, however the dark brown comes out as black, so I just ordered the Auburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I try and be as light as possible with the brush and then dab with a tissue to get out any extra.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking .</li>
      <li>so I use a smaller brush and wipe it from the large brush.</li>
      <li>no mess and</li>
      <li>This looks totaly natural ( as long as you don&#x27;t use to much)</li>
      <li>After several other attempts I gave up and threw it in the trash, I&#x27;ll go back to what I know works.&lt;br /&gt;Update: surprisingly I have not been contacted by seller, this assures me I am not among the few that just did not apply correctly.</li>
      <li>6 months no harsh no itching only thing</li>
      <li>Popular dyes are harsh and only last a few days due to gray growing back.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a good product works well..</li>
    <li> Awesome product ! So easy to use , just apply it by brushing it .. no irritations no mess and it drys in seconds ! I recommend it ....</li>
    <li> Convenience, natural looking, easy to apply &amp; good results. The proper shade, affordable, no mess, hardly any cleanup after applying.</li>
    <li> It is basically just goop that you smear on your beard. You have to be careful not to get the color on your skin. And there is very little in each small bottle. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it every day, but it might work for you for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Best on the market! Stays on and looks great. No one knows I&#x27;m using a coloring agent because it doesn&#x27;t look like a dye job. It leaves a few grey hairs here and there. I found the main brush a bit too much so I use a smaller brush and wipe it from the large brush. Bought a 3 pack for even more savings! And easy to touch up after a long day!</li>
    <li> Great product m using this been last 6 months no harsh no itching only thing I can&#x27;t wear white shirt, but m happy.</li>
    <li> I never rite reviews but this stuff works great! the applicator works great because it&#x27;s small so you can palce the color on skinny hair lines without getting it all over your skin. Also you only have to brush into the surface of you hair &amp; it wicks down to the root without getting color on your skin (which advertises to everyone you color your hair!) This looks totaly natural ( as long as you don&#x27;t use to much) A very small amount goes a long way &amp; it&#x27;s fast it takes seconds to apply &amp; dries just as fast. I thought I would have to worry about it rubbing off &amp; getting on my shirt but it doesen&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Very simple but so effective, looked younger instantly.would highly recommend to all my friends, in seconds natural looking coloring with just a hint of grey , huge difference!</li>
    <li> The dark brown color is a perfect match for me. I&#x27;ve noticed the ladies checking me out more since I&#x27;ve started using it. The product doesn&#x27;t burn or blister my face like Just For Men. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> No more itching or irritation! Popular dyes are harsh and only last a few days due to gray growing back.&lt;br /&gt;Use a light touch with the brush and you&#x27;re out the door! Wipe the end of the brush onto the lid of the container to prevent clumping before use. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> works well only when applied perfectly..main disadvantage is it stays only for few hours(4-5 hrs max)..it should be longer acting..</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. I don&#x27;t use it every day but I use it to get rid of gray when I go out and it works fine. Im not into dying my facial hair but this is easy and so yeah. It goes on pretty easy and I like to go light because it looks more natrual than heavy. The black blends pretty good with my hair color and really i have no complaints. Maybe if you have a heavy beard it might not work as well but for my stubble and sideburns it is perfect so thumbs up blackbeard.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped and received quickly, in had been using another product that lasted 3-5 days but took 10 minutes to apply, the 30 second application was what I was looking forward to. First application was a failure, it was clumpy and after working 10 minutes to get it looking half-way right it easily wiped off on my clothing. After several other attempts I gave up and threw it in the trash, I&#x27;ll go back to what I know works.&lt;br /&gt;Update: surprisingly I have not been contacted by seller, this assures me I am not among the few that just did not apply correctly. When I asked my wife, much younger wife, she said it looked pitiful, so even if you think it looks \\&quot;passable\\&quot; it probably does not.</li>
    <li> It work for me, is very good. easy to use,and easy to take off. I recoment this to any bodyThanks</li>
    <li> Yea it&#x27;s great stuff, however the dark brown comes out as black, so I just ordered the Auburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use women&#x27;s products, but they would only give a tiny amount, for a beard and mustache it would go very fast. If I would make a suggestion so that EVERYONE uses it, make the size a little bigger, I know you need and should make a profit, but it would be nice to have a little extra, but yea great stuff!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it dries after few minutes</li>
    <li> I used &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for a few years when suddenly I became allergic to it. Blackbeard needs to be applied every day but there&#x27;s no bad itching reaction.. It goes on easily with the supplied brush. Then, use a soft full size hair brush to spread the color through the beard so it looks more natural. I will be purchasing this product from now on.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says it does and i would recommend this product to anyone thinking about buying it.</li>
    <li> Works great, looks great and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Also no rash or burn like dyes . Very natural looking . I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> Does the job but you have to be very careful to not go too heavy. I try and be as light as possible with the brush and then dab with a tissue to get out any extra. Also, make sure you keep it on you as daily activity will eventually rub it off a bit so you&#x27;ll need a quick reapply depending on the location. Other than that, worked great and it&#x27;s not permanent which is actually nice.</li>
