<li> well- but, label says it detangles- not on my thin somewhat coarse hair-</li>
<li> I received my product a few days ago.</li>
<li> Not sure why...</li>
<li> Unbelievable shine, does not fade my color, no buildup...</li>
<li> so now I deal with very dried out hair.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have too much of a crazy perfume smell but doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell like that nose hair curling salon smell.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s ok shampoo- lathers well- but, label says it detangles- not on my thin somewhat coarse hair- that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m trying to find- is a Detangling shampoo!!! I guess- I&#x27;ll keep trying -</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for a couple of months, my hairdresser commented on how healthy my hair is.  It really works!</li>
    <li> 5 star product! Very true to the product description. It actually helps fragile hair follicles specially if the hair is falling. It will strengthen the roots and provide hair with a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> My hair was really damaged from coloring &amp; heat from hair dryer/hot iron, &amp; the sun.  My colorist suggested it &amp; I love it.  Hair is soft &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used the L&#x27;oreal Professional shampoos for years.  They are excellent!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PUMP. EASY TO DISPENSE. IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND MANEGEABLE. WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> The smell of this shampoo is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t have too much of a crazy perfume smell but doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell like that nose hair curling salon smell. I have very long naturally curly thick hair and this shampoo is very lathering which I love. It really cleans your hair and scalp without drying or leaving any build up or residue. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or create any waxy or oily residue to your hair. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this product... loved the price... Thank you for making it affordable to me.. Delivered quickly without problem.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, processed hair and have been using Loreal Professionel Series Expert products for over 6 years that I always purchased from salons that are licensed to sell it. I decided to order online for convenience...BIG mistake. This product is FAKE and nothing like the real product. It made my hair feel like straw after one use. It suds up tremendously where the real product does not.  The smell is slightly different as well. I should&#x27;ve known better but didn&#x27;t really think people out there are making and selling counterfeit hair products! I ordered 3 products from 3 different sellers at the same time off Amazon and all are fake. It&#x27;s misrepresentation and I feel Amazon should ban these fraudulent vendors from doing business on their website.</li>
    <li> Love this for my color treated hair!  Lathers well so I don&#x27;t need much. Been using it for about 10 months. Have tried others but for my hair this is the best.</li>
    <li> Love it.. I normally get it from my hairdresser,same product a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> Loved it! Good as everything from Loreal. I love Loreal Professionnel line.</li>
    <li> I received my product a few days ago. Took less than the estimated arrival date. It seems to be alright.</li>
    <li> Nice product. It really helps reducing hair fall</li>
    <li> In my 40&#x27;s, ladies, you know that means challenges for your hair....those fighting those greys, breakage, dryness...this high-end Loreal hair product line has turned back the hands of time. Unbelievable shine, does not fade my color, no buildup...I use it with the conditioner, and other Kerastase (the HIGHEST END of Loreal products), it&#x27;s been a decade since my hair was this beautiful.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair so much more manageable and soft.  I have fine and dry hair and before I started using this shampoo, my hair looked lifeless.  Now it is shiny, soft and holds the style so much better.  I will always use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!!!! I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I first bought some of this shampoo when I was on a trip to Europe and loved it. Wonderful product which I can&#x27;t find easily in stores near me.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have thick fine wavy hair and love this shampoo! You don&#x27;t need that much as it spreads very easily. I live in Colorado&lt;br /&gt;Where it&#x27;s really dy and this stuff works&lt;br /&gt;Wonders.</li>
    <li> Great product to add protein to damaged hair.  Helps to make the hair less brittle when paired with the hair masque to use as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner revamped my hair in a huge way, I had my blonde turned to blue and a chemical cut by a stylist, my hair was in horrible shape. I found a new stylist who helped me get my hair back on track and she told me to use this product, it has been a year and this is all I have used, my hair is finally back to normal and I am a silver blonde. Totally transformed my hair, took awhile but it worked:)</li>
    <li> Great  shampoo. healthy and manageable</li>
    <li> I wash my hair every day and this shampoo is not drying.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioning shampoo that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only available in salons, and not that many in my area, and through Amazon it&#x27;s delivered to my door at a better price even.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered through Amazon exactly what I&#x27;d pay more for in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;All good experience.</li>
    <li> higher price than i would pay again, but the product is good and it was delivered ahead of expectation</li>
    <li> The product itself is wonderful. It arrived wrapped in bubble wrap but the shampoo had leaked and was all over the in side of the bubble wrap . Not sure why...</li>
    <li> This smells great and moisturizes my hair so much that I can run fingers thru it in the shower. I box bleached my hair so now I deal with very dried out hair.  I believe this helps.</li>
