<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this brush it feels good on my scalp.  Gave the extra one to a friend and they love it also.</li>
    <li> These brushes have become a must have in our house. They are amazing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for brushing wet or dry hair.  I would have given 5 stars but they are not holding up well as promised.  I will contact the manufacturing company</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes as holiday gifts after hearing great things about them.  I was told they love them after receiving them and using them.</li>
    <li> These came quickly, packaged carefully, and were beautiful colors. My daughter was all smiles. The brushes work great through wet hair and is the only brush she likes to use.</li>
    <li> These are the only brushes we use for my daughters extremely long and knotty hair.  I only wish I had discovered them sooner.  My friend that is a hair stylist gave me one and we haven&#x27;t turned back.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about these brushes but we all end up in tears if we even attempt to use a different one.  Just buy a few so that you don&#x27;t lose your mind when the kids inevitably misplace it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and how fast I got it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My kids favorite brushes.</li>
    <li> Between me and my 3 daughters, we own 6 of these brushes. I can attest that this product will give you healthier hair, guaranteed. I have been using these brushes for the past 2 years and I do not h ve a single split end anymore. My middle child had bad split ends but not anymore. Because your brush doesnt get stuck in your hair mid-brush that this brush prevents damage from hair pulling and breakage from tangles. Highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Bought my first one from my hairstylist.  Loved them and bought another for myself and some as gifts.  I have a light to moderate curl in my long hair.  I can actually brush my hair when I get out of the shower with no pulling or damage!</li>
    <li> best brush.... especially for young girls with long hair</li>
    <li> These are great... Thanks!</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty good with getting the knots out of my girls hair</li>
    <li> These brushes get through anyone&#x27;s hair! It brushes the hair out when wet. Do not dry with them bc u could melt the bristles.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. Bought for young daughter,  then bought more for husband and me!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! A little pricey at $10 a piece but they are so good on tangles and leave the hair really smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought a wet brush because everyone was saying it was the greatest thing ever for long hair.  I have very long, thick hair, so I was excited to try this &amp;#34;amazing brush&amp;#34;.  It works well for brushing wet hair; however, I used it while I was blow drying my hair and all of the bristles bent to the point where I cannot use it anymore.  So, I guess if you are just going to brush your hair and not blow dry it would be okay, but don&#x27;t buy this brush if you think you will be able to use it while blow drying!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  I came back and bought more for family and friends.  If you have long hair or a sensitive scalp or just hate using a comb on wet hair, buy these!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and it is constantly knotting up.  This brush is an amazing discovery! It does not pull your hair out and is meant to use while wet. Most salons suggest not to use a regular brush on wet hair, but this brush is meant for it.  It also is great on my dry hair and does not pull my hair out.</li>
    <li> most awesome brushes! I bought 6 more to give to friends and family! I would love to buy another pack of 10!</li>
    <li> The only brushes I use anymore. The are great for when my hair is wet but also when it&#x27;s dry . I have very thin hair that tangles easily so this brush makes brushing my hair easier</li>
    <li> Best brush by far. Everyone needs one ! I purchased 2 one for me and one for my daughter . Good for long tangly hair</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!  I have had Carpal Tunnel for many years, and brushing my daughters hair has always been almost impossible.  Between my hand issues and her impossible hair, it would take a long time to brush her hair and always ended in tears (sometimes for both of us!). Regardless of spray in detanglers, or brushes marketed to get the tangles out, nothing worked.  This brush though, WOW. This brush is magic!  It glides through any sort of hair effortlessly!  The bristles are super soft so it&#x27;s like a head massage as well.  My daughters step mom is actually the one who got her the brush, and then we had to go get all the women in our family one, because they loved my daughters so much!</li>
    <li> This brush is everything it says it is! I have longer, thick, wavy hair and it works great for brushing it out wet or dry.</li>
    <li> A+++ Service Fast shipping! I have very long hair and I only use this brush. I bought these for my granddaughters (8 &amp; 12) a few years ago, and they love them, they won&#x27;t use anything else. Great for wet and dry hair, and no more fussing with tangled hair. I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!</li>
    <li> Best brush in the world.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are amazing for extra thick and curly/wavy hair.  Both strong and gentle, which I&#x27;d always thought was impossible. Possibly the best brush that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush !!  I have long hair and this brush goes right through the tangles.  My granddaughter loves it for her long hair. Perfect for two year old granddaughters hair. No more tears. Good price for a great brush.</li>
    <li> love this for my girls hair not fuss right out of the bath, and the 2 pack was great so each girl got their own brush.</li>
    <li> I washed my granddaughter&#x27;s waist-length hair, applied conditioner, and pulled this brush through it, and with 3 STROKES! their hair was smooth as silk..absolutely no tangles. Utterly uncanny! I am dumbfounded! This is without a doubt the BEST hair brush I have ever used. For the first time my 6 year old and 4 year old Granddaughters were able to pull a brush easily though their hair. They will hardly put the brushes down. They just walk around brushing their hair, and loving it. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> best brush around. feels great on head and is good for kids (although there&#x27;s a smaller size for them)</li>
    <li> We love these brushes. Not only are they pretty, but they work great. I compared them to my old brush. When I use the wet brush it hurts a lot less when getting tangles out. My daughter loves it too. It is so worth it. I love the 2 pack. So convenient. We keep 1 upstairs and 1downstairs.</li>
    <li> Magic in a brush.  We have 3 granddaughters with long hair, this brush has eliminated all crying, it works well with both wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> These work so well for granddaughters hair!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE Them!!!</li>
    <li> My wife is behind me and insisting I review the brushes I got for her.&lt;br /&gt;This is God&#x27;s own hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;After a life of fighting every brush she has ever met this one is almost completely snag free. Butt length thick hair and this works great. When she has made me brush her hair she has made 0 shrieking noises unlike every other brush I have used on her.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry it doesn&#x27;t matter. As this is God&#x27;s own hair brush you should have guessed that already.&lt;br /&gt;She loves this brush so much she has made me buy the for everyone of her girl friends. I&#x27;d get some for my male friends but most of us shave our heads or have short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things deserve a 6th star for being as affordable as they are.</li>
    <li> My daughter would previously run and hide after bath time because she did not want her hair brushed.  These brushes have changed her reaction to hair brushing after bath/shower time.  She now wants to brush her own hair and there is absolutely no crying.  My wife actually started using the brush as well and she loves how there is no pulling through tangles.</li>
    <li> works as described! doesn&#x27;t pull my hair too much and combs right through! i have really dry &amp; damanged dyed hair :( but it works great! i still have tangles and knots but doesn&#x27;t hurt like my other combs.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  Got the blue one for my boyfriend.  He has long hair and the brush works great on the tangles.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> The brushes came right on time and they get all the knots out. The two pack is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes! I own a couple through out the years! I wouldn&#x27;t use any others! They are great on wet or dry hair and especially on long hair! My kids love it too because it doesn&#x27;t pull their hair. I highly recommend the ones with the bore bristles in between as well! Great for making your hair look shiny!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for my granddaughter.  I bought 2 extra brushes to put away because I never want to be without one for her.  They never pull her hair and she has no problem getting her hair brushed with these.</li>
    <li> For mine and my daughters long hair this is the best brush we&#x27;ve ever found! Use it on wet or dry hair- works great either way. We keep plenty of these around. Just be careful using this brush while blow drying your hair, the heat from the dryer can weaken the bristles and it doesn&#x27;t work as well then. We love this brush!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic. I saw a brief review of this brush on tv. I didn&#x27;t really think it would work, so I went looking on YouTube. Still not a believer, I ordered The Wet Brush, thinking, &#x27;yeah, we&#x27;ll see&#x27;. Did I ever!!  To my happy surprise, it works!  I have long, naturally curly hair. It tangles and knots all by itself. It&#x27;s a constant fight, and I still end up cutting tangles out frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technique that worked for me with this brush was to give my hair short, light strokes.  The second and successive brush strokes were longer and deeper. By the third or fourth, the tangles were out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brush on dry and wet hair. Success with both!  I&#x27;m amazed, no longer yelping as I brush my hair and very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review has been helpful to you, please click yes below. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this! It makes our morning routine so much easier &amp; the double set is nice to have one brush at home and one in the ballet or pool bag. It works easily to get tangles of all sizes out effortlessly &amp; is great for little hands too!</li>
    <li> I have long and naturally curly hair so it is always frustrating every time when I have to untangle my hair but when I stared using The Wet Brush it take half the time than usual to get the job done!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best brushes I have used to brush my daughters&#x27; hair. Their hair is usually very tangled in the morning or after taking a shower and these make combing their much easier and painless. I have bought another one since buying these two.  Very good seller as well.</li>
    <li> I had read that you would be able to use this brush with dry hair. My experience is that it only works with wet hair I guess that&#x27;s why they call it the Wet Brush.  Eight year old daughter loves it and it&#x27;s almost pain free.  You still get a lil pain she says but says but nothing like before where she would pull away or cry. I definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I have these brushes in black, blue, pink and purple. They are the best and is all that I use now and most of my family. I do agree, these are the only ones I have purchased online and they stink. I have tried to air them out but I can still detect a smell when using it like burnt rubber.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in appearance from other brushes of this type, but they do really work. My granddaughter has fine, thick hair that easily forms nests of tangles. This is about the only way to get her tangle free without pain.</li>
    <li> my daughter wanted these because we all were sharing one. they love the color although it wasnt as bright as they thought it would be. they love these brushes. they just slip right through the knots. we use these with wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> The brush was on point and my granddaughter not scram around.  It worked especially on her very thick Africa-American hair when wet.  It detangles along with a product.  Try it you&#x27;ll be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debborah&lt;br /&gt;Alabama</li>
    <li> I wanted to give no stars. What a waste of money. These brushes are exactly like any other brushes. They do not make any difference in ease of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It was great at first but then I started getting knots and they were hard to get out with the wet brush. I needed to use a regular brush to get them out.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, it really reduces the frizz in my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> No more tangles or tears! I have thick, knotty hair when it&#x27;s wet. With this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; brush I have have to worry about pulling my hair out even without leave in conditioner. This brush/brand works great on dry hair as well as thin hair, hair of all ages too. Worth every penny! And make great gifts</li>
    <li> Best brush for everyone in the family!</li>
    <li> These really do work to brush wet or dry hair without hurting!  My kids love theirs!</li>
    <li> Awesome for granddaughters hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  We now have four.  My 6 and 8 year old girls will not use another brush.</li>
    <li> Huge!!! Not for carrying in your purse</li>
    <li> Works well in wet hair and doesn&#x27;t pull</li>
    <li> The only brushes we use in our household.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair thick and curly. This is the only brushes she uses&lt;br /&gt;We gave them for presents to all our friends : moms and their daughters.</li>
    <li> These brushes really do work without hurting kids&#x27; scalps.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing...these work really well for my 7 and 10 year old girls, who have sensitive scalps.  Great for wet or dry hair!!</li>
    <li> Great brush and quick delivery</li>
    <li> My hair is always so knotty especially after washing my hair or just waking up in the morning it was always a battle between my brush and I untill I discovered the wet brush! My hairdresser told me about it I instantly went home and ordered it from amazon! (they also sell them at target) after she raved about it I just had to see for myself even though I was a little skeptical but low and behold it worked just like she said it would! Finally I can brush my hair with ease and not worry about pulling my hair out I am so happy I found this brush I highly reccomend it</li>
    <li> Great Brush!  Goes through wet or dry tangled hair easier than any other brush we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  Good Price</li>
    <li> I have long ,fine hair which tangles too easily. These brushes allow  me to have  silky hair  without the pain and stress of yanking out knots . I can even brush my wet hair without worry .</li>
    <li> The only brush my daughter will use.</li>
    <li> My daughter hated brushing her hair until we bought these! Soft on the head and the bristles move easily.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Does not rip your hair out.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, this is our second order. The girls have finally stopped whining while getting their hair brushed. It&#x27;s a small Miracle.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! They smell TERRIBLE when you first get them, but it eventually passes. Still worth it!</li>
    <li> Works wonders! No more cries from my girls. Makes brushing long hair a breeze. Makes the best ponies too, nice and shiny!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Wet brushes, they were recommended to me by my hair stylist. I use them for myself and my daughter (5). We both have hair below the shoulders, mine is quite thick and hers is thinner but these brushes are great for us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first receive them, the bristles feel a bit stiff but after a couple uses, they become very flexible and are great for detangling. I am not tender-headed but my daughter is and this brush has really improved hair brushing time. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll ever buy another brush!</li>
    <li> The only brush my daughters will use</li>
    <li> These brushes are seriously awesome.  I have three girls with long hair, and the youngest two hate it when I brush their hair with a regular brush.  But they will let me use the wet brush on them, and it has made mornings SO much easier!  I ordered the two pack to start and ended up ordering two more less than a week later.</li>
    <li> One of our kids get tangles after swimming - mainly underneath close to the scalp - and on one occasion where I couldn&#x27;t deal with a particularly tenacious lock, we ended up at my hair stylist&#x27;s. She patiently proceeded to tease apart the birds nest, as I refer to it, with the Wet Brush. It was amazing! She clued us into it and before we&#x27;d left the salon I had ordered two of them. Really worth it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for tangled hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than anything we have ever used previously.  Just be careful not be too aggressive or it can still hurt a little.</li>
    <li> Best wet brush ever! First brush I&#x27;ve used on wet hair out of the shower that doesn&#x27;t hurt! This was a better deal than at a salon, which I paid $12 for a single brush. Buy online!</li>
    <li> brush works really well, I have thin wavy hair, my sister has thick long semi-straight hair, and my mother has short curly hair. This brush works perfectly for all of us. Works best on damp hair, but it also works really well on dry and wet hair. I highly recomend</li>
    <li> kids love brush after taking shower.  great product</li>
    <li> Awesome! No more tears when it is time to brush my girls hair. They can even do it on their own now. I have one daughter with fine straight hair and one with coarser wavy hair. This brush works great for both.</li>
    <li> This made my granddaughter not cry when we had to comb out her tangled hair.  I like the fact that I got two......one for each of us.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes work great.  I personally shave my head and these provide a great massage (joking).  My daughter has very long hair, and it really gets the tangles out without hurting her.  Another woman in my life has very thick wavy hair and my daughter let her borrow her brush and she fell in love with it.  Works great on wet or dry hair.  Even with 5 different brushes in the drawer this is the brush that gets all the use.  Only thing I noticed was the finish started peeling on the &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34; finish brushes handle after only a couple months.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush I use to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair. Works wonders with her tangled hair.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I won one at a bridal shower and thought it was a strange gift. Then I used it and it was  awesome. I bought these to go in my office at work and in my gym bag and each kid has their own wet dry brush and they love them.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after reading somewhere that they take the tears out of brushing hair. It&#x27;s true. My 7-year-old was forever not brushing her straight hair thoroughly and then whining and crying when I would make her let me brush it again. She is able to brush it thoroughly with these brushes. It&#x27;s odd because it sounds like the hair is pulling when you brush, but you can&#x27;t feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;My 14-year-old who has thick wavy hair tried one, and she was amazed.</li>
    <li> Best hair brush ever. I tossed all my other ones for my daughter out. These work great in her hair and mine. She is five and has very long, semi curly hair that is fine, but plentiful. I have the same but finer and short, with some straight areas. It works on our hair wet or dry. They do not rip her hair or tear it like the &amp;#34;knot genie&amp;#34; and other brushes like that. Ugh-those may work but they really rip up your hair. So do not use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrived fast at the promised time and in the requested colors. I have no idea what took me so long to find this, but I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> works great on my toddlers thin hair.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt her.  My hair, which is a little thicker, takes longer to brush.  It works on the tangles but just takes more time.  Still use and it like it though</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they are great. Will never go back to the old kind. These do not break your hair and are special for wet hair . They are fine for dry hair as well.</li>
    <li> Daughter won&#x27;t let me brush her hair with anything else!!</li>
    <li> My daughters absolutely love these brushes!  So much less fussy g and complaining about doing hair.</li>
