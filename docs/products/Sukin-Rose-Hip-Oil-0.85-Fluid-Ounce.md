      <li>I liked it so much that after using it for a week I bought another bottle</li>
      <li>my skin looks bright and feels incredibly soft.  </li>
      <li>Massage until most of it is absorbed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and it works well.</li>
      <li>My skin was instantly softer and it has a light pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>

      <li>I love this stuff so much.  </li>

      <li>You put 2-3 drops in your hands or fingertips and it absorbs quickly into your face.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this every night now for several weeks and very pleased.  </li>
      <li>but I heard so much about Rose hip oil that I had to buy myself a bottle and try it out for myself, due to my surprise this oil work;s wonders on your skin, it have a earthy smell to it, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all because I like those kind of smell.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such an amazing products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using the Rose Hip Oil for two months now and can feel the difference - my pores seem smaller.  </li>
      <li>The Sukin is available for purchase directly from Amazon and if you&#x27;re a Prime member you get free shipping.  </li>
      <li>But finally did and was amazed at how effective this is</li>
      <li>After only 2 weeks my skin was much softer and smooth, but make sure you damp you skin before applying it so it can absorb quicker into the skin</li>
      <li>It also came with a free 4.23 oz facial moisturizer, which was a very pleasant surprise, but I had already ordered and just received the same facial moisturizer..</li>
      <li>my skin is soft and smooth highly recommended it does have a smell to it but other than that it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
      <li>It just feels as though it&#x27;s a quick and intense vitamin C serum.  </li>
      <li>and you only need at most 2-3 drops.</li>
      <li>it would of been better just to go to local stores and get it.</li>
      <li>I have also been using other products from this line and they are all fantastic!!</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product</li>
      <li>and I have used so many different products,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands rose hip oil and none of them came close to this one.</li>
      <li>First and foremost it&#x27;s a pure oil without any fillers.</li>
      <li>-- really smoothes the skin, is very gentle, absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>The scent is slightly floral and warm.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>but I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Texture is very lite and amber colored.</li>
      <li>Was a gift, so can&#x27;t say much about this product</li>
      <li>The dropper works very well</li>
      <li>This is the only facial oill I have tried but will keep using this Sukin Rose Hip oil.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other oils and I love them</li>
      <li>Rosehip oil has been touted as a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product that helps the skin with wrinkles, scars, anti-aging and many other issues.  </li>
      <li>This was a nice rosehip oil that lasted me a few months!</li>
      <li>Not only does the oil moisturize and absorb quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.  </li>
      <li>so far I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts using this product.</li>
      <li>I apply the product to my damp face at night, my skin feels  soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>It makes the skin on my face so soft.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive dryish skin that can break out.  </li>
      <li>Two drops is all I need to wake up to soft balanced skin.</li>
      <li>seen big improvement, my face feels much softer and it looks radiant..</li>
      <li>When you apply this oil in sections you will not waste the oil and it gives your skin a chance to fully drink it</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a new, high quality Australian skincare product and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>but it goes a long way and absorbs very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to facial oils</li>
      <li>Really helped with my dry skin.</li>
      <li>No more break out and my skin feels super soft.</li>
      <li>The Trilogy (at this time) is not being sold directly by Amazon so one would have to pay for the oil plus the $4 shipping from the third party</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> During the winter my face tends to get pink, especially since I am a swimmer and the chlorine drys the face. I used these products when I was in Australia and they took years off my face. The rose hip oil keeps my face hydrated and skin tone looking fresh. I put it on every morning and sometimes before bed if I remember.</li>
    <li> No more break out and my skin feels super soft.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night, I put about three drops on my face. It has helped with reducing the appearance of acne scars and it does help with reducing my flares up of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply the product to my damp face at night, my skin feels  soft in the morning. (I do not apply a moisturizer on top of this product for night time use.)</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil has been touted as a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product that helps the skin with wrinkles, scars, anti-aging and many other issues.  There are different brands out there with varying levels of approval from users.  Prior to using Sukin&#x27;s Rosehip Oil I was using the Trilogy Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the Sukin Rosehip Oil.  First and foremost it&#x27;s a pure oil without any fillers. It&#x27;s very light to the touch and absorbs smoothly and beautifully into the skin.  There is no oily residue.  The scent is slightly floral and warm.  It nourishes my combination skin and provides a non-greasy, delicate moisture food.  When I get out of bed in the morning my skin looks bright and feels incredibly soft.  The fine lines around my eyes look diminished and my skin looks supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this oil, please don&#x27;t slather on the oil onto your face all at once-- do it in sections and stages.  After washing and toning your skin, apply 2 drops to your forehead.  Take the time to massage it into your forehead area.  If you have oil leftover, move it down to your cheeks.  Massage until most of it is absorbed.  Apply 1-2 drops onto each of your cheeks and massage it into the area.  When you apply this oil in sections you will not waste the oil and it gives your skin a chance to fully drink it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cost this is approximately $5 cheaper than the Trilogy Rosehip Oil.  The Sukin is available for purchase directly from Amazon and if you&#x27;re a Prime member you get free shipping.  The Trilogy (at this time) is not being sold directly by Amazon so one would have to pay for the oil plus the $4 shipping from the third party vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product. I have had NO regrets whatsoever with this purchase and look forward to buying it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> This product helped to keep my skin from drying out, I am a psoriasis sufferer and the rose hip iol&lt;br /&gt;helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> This oil is excellent. I like the fact that it is organic. The oil sinks into the skin. Does not cause acne, which is great since my skin is prone to breakouts. Very rich and i really liked the sample moisturizer in box. However, the dropler is easily broken. I spilled an entire bottle without realizing it. It tilted and the oil spilled through the droppler head. But overall good product.</li>
    <li> This was a nice rosehip oil that lasted me a few months! I used it regularly on my face and sometimes back. Very hydrating, nice smell to it. Only con is the price, once I finished this bottle I just went to the local vitamin store and bought the Life Flo rosehip oil. It was way cheaper!</li>
    <li> After using for over a month I see my skin getting rejuvinice. I use it at night on damp skin, it gives me moisture and is helping my skin feel smoother and helps it glow.</li>
    <li> I never knew I could find something that was amazing for my feet. The driest part of my feet are my heels and I have used so many different products, but oh my gosh I just loved this stuff so much for my feet. Thank you for such an amazing products. I do plan to order some more soon.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s excellent for my skin type. feels nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;A slight odd smell but tolerable. Texture is very lite and amber colored.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much.  I have sensitive dryish skin that can break out.  I feel as though this oil normalizes it and I never feel like my face is tight anymore!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 year and I am amazed at what it has done for my skin. Even my esthetician keeps telling me how wonderful my skin looks...I have also been using other products from this line and they are all fantastic!! Highly recommend! And the price is right!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way--I mix it with my moisturizer in my palm before applying--I get better coverage that way than just trying to put 2-3 drops of oil all over my face. Expensive, however!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing totally worth the price my skin is soft and smooth highly recommended it does have a smell to it but other than that it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
    <li> Great product. Really helped with my dry skin. It also came with a free 4.23 oz facial moisturizer, which was a very pleasant surprise, but I had already ordered and just received the same facial moisturizer..so now I have 2. Not complaining tho! Just wanted to give a heads up to others that order this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for eczema and to rehydrating your skin. A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly!</li>
    <li> This may be a little pricey but it goes a long way and absorbs very well.  The dropper works very well (sometimes droppers drip all over the place).  It makes the skin on my face so soft.</li>
    <li> i feel like i have ordered the prodoct longtime ago, and i can believe it i didnt get it yet. it would of been better just to go to local stores and get it.</li>
    <li> Use on my face every night. Eliminated my dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth and it works well. I wish the bottle was bigger because it is really expensive everywhere online and in stores.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer! I wear alone or under my face lotion during the day for sunblock protection. My skin was instantly softer and it has a light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Love it! Two drops is all I need to wake up to soft balanced skin.</li>
    <li> I tried it two times. I thought its a good moisturiser but both the times it broke me out. I have normal to dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a miracle in a jar!!! I have tried every product known to man to help with my dry skin without making me break out. Finally I&#x27;ve found it. It is non greasy, and goes great under my makeup. Makes my skin look great, and like I&#x27;ve said doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Within two weeks of consistently applying the rose hip oil, my acne scars and texture of my skin has improved very noticeably. This has become my staple serum/moisturizer in my skin care regimen</li>
    <li> I have tried other oils and I love them but I heard so much about Rose hip oil that I had to buy myself a bottle and try it out for myself, due to my surprise this oil work;s wonders on your skin, it have a earthy smell to it, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all because I like those kind of smell. After only 2 weeks my skin was much softer and smooth, but make sure you damp you skin before applying it so it can absorb quicker into the skin and you only need at most 2-3 drops.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this based on reviews of facial oils and this product specifically (on MakeupAlley).  Was somewhat afraid to try an oil as I have minor breakouts from time to time.  But finally did and was amazed at how effective this is -- really smoothes the skin, is very gentle, absorbs well.  Have been using this every night now for several weeks and very pleased.  Absolutely no hint of any breakout or clogged pores.  This is the only facial oill I have tried but will keep using this Sukin Rose Hip oil.  I also use the Sukin moisturizer during the day.  I sometimes apply it by itself and sometimes mix it with a tinted moisturizer.  Am very glad to have learned about Sukin and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month now. Two to three drops, twice a day, mornings and evenings while my skin is still damp after cleansing. I follow up with the Sukin moisturizer. The rosehip oil has a nice, mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point in my life, my skin can get very dry and scaly, but I still manage to get acne. Go figure! Good new is, so far I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts using this product. But the best part is how many compliments I&#x27;ve gotten about my skin. I really was just looking for something to keep my face moist in the dry southern California air, but I&#x27;ve had numerous people, strangers even, compliment me. It&#x27;s kinda weird really. Lol. I believe the rosehip oil has made a difference. I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff for your skin.</li>
    <li> This is been part of my night routine for the last 4 years. I&#x27;m obsessed. It&#x27;s the only product I rely to bring life back to my face. It makes my skin glow and look so healthy. I&#x27;ve tried other brands rose hip oil and none of them came close to this one. By far the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to facial oils but I found this Sukin Rose Hip Oil while traveling in Australia. I wanted to try a new, high quality Australian skincare product and was pleasantly surprised.  Not only does the oil moisturize and absorb quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.  It just feels as though it&#x27;s a quick and intense vitamin C serum.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses per se but it does feel like it softens and smoothens my skin.  I liked it so much that after using it for a week I bought another bottle so I have a spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using the Rose Hip Oil for two months now and can feel the difference - my pores seem smaller.  The oil is more easily absorbed than moisturizer and feels wonderful.  I recently read in Allure magazine that they recommend using it every other day, so I&#x27;ve adjusted from using it twice daily to in the evening every other day.  Still very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I had never used rose hip oil before but I really like this product.  Its a great base (serum like) for under your moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks (4-5 days a week, twice a day) and my face is more supple.  I also feel like its helped even out some of my sun spots.  Best thing is that its not greasy.  You put 2-3 drops in your hands or fingertips and it absorbs quickly into your face.  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Awesome product, shipped super fast! Love it!</li>
    <li> No confident in this rosehip oil since the actual product box which it came in was crushed, old, wrinkled, and busted inside in a ziplock bag. However, the outside shipping box is in good shape and fine. I am not sure if this was a left over product laying around and decided to ship it out without considerations.</li>
    <li> I use this oil when I massage the face as I am a massage therapist and my clients LOVE it.Never causes break outs and is wonderful for the skin and feels amazing to touch your face after using.I found this at a store and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Was a gift, so can&#x27;t say much about this product</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product and I LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;I seen big improvement, my face feels much softer and it looks radiant.. Love this brand and product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
