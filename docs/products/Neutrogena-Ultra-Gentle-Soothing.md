<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter has really sensitive dry skin and this is the only cream we have found that helps.  Keeps her skin from looking red and chapped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only face cream I can use. It doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen or other additives that irritate my skin. As long at Neutrogena continues to make it, I will  continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This works very well on my sensitive rosacea skin.  It doesn&#x27;t itch and burn like almost every other lotion or cream available.</li>
    <li> Very light and gentle.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and then I am unaware I have it on.  My skin stays moist and flexible without any greasy shiny flim.</li>
    <li> This cream may be soothing to the skin but has a very stong scent that smells like bad cheap perfume. I would be embarrassed to sit near anyone in a closed space after using it. I wasted my money--don&#x27;t waste yours</li>
    <li> They no longer sell this exact cream in this container, they sell it in a pump. I&#x27;m more fond of this version.</li>
    <li> It was a mistake to buy this product. The cream seems to be a bit old (perhaps out of date?) and the plastic container was demaged, it cannot be closed properly.</li>
    <li> Great product and I love how it feels on my skin. Only con is that it looks like there&#x27;s more cream in the jar than there is. If you look at the product photo, the amount of cream that is in there stops where the &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; text is. Although I find this a bit misleading, it does not take away from the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> One of the best face moisturizers ever</li>
    <li> This product worked right away for me, it helped calm the redness and I love how it goes on under make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in  my early 50s and going through menopause my skin has become dry this product did not burn at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and really did calm my skin!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this is no longer sold in stores, but I was thrilled to find it here. I love this cream for my face. It is great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be wonderful as I had used it before and it disappeared off the store shelves, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  The problem was I developed an allergy to it!</li>
    <li> Great soothing cream for dry itchy spots on face and neck.  Great alternative to using too much cortisone.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this.</li>
    <li> I started using the Neutrogena Soothing Cream after I tried the Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15. I wanted to have something that I could have on at night when I didn&#x27;t need an SPF protection. I apply this after I wash my face and retire for the night. It&#x27;s very light and refreshing on my face. I am glad it&#x27;s not heavy and its not noticeably layered on your face.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what Neutrogena was thinking when they formulated this.  It burns and stings on face contact! I&#x27;ve pretty much had this reaction to all of their face lotions.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the alcohol  listed in the ingredients.  If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the smell is so overwhelming it gave me a migraine.  Fragrance is a known skin irritant, especially for  people with sensitive skin. So why is fragrance listed in the middle of the ingredient list?! And why is it in the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to leave the cap off to see if the smell does down and possibly use it on my legs, or I&#x27;ll just throw it away.  I really wanted to love this stuff too.  What a waste of money.  The search continues for a facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!  That scent is overpowering.  Does not make sense for an ultra gentle product to have a fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry J&amp;J has discontinued this wonderful product. It is extremely to find a moisture these days which doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen. Many of us cannot use the commercial sunscreen products.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my husband. He has sensitive dry skin.  Really good stuff that works well for him</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream for the summertime. It&#x27;s soothing,cooling &amp; comforting after a day in the sun. I also love to use it at night over a serum. It feels almost like a balm &amp; I love the fresh smell. Sorry they are not making it anymore.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome for sensitive or irritated skin. It really calms while moisturizing the the skin. It smells very pleasant and can be used day and night.</li>
    <li> For some reason, the skin around my eyes was getting irritated with my usual lotions.  So I decided to look for something that would not irritate my skin. I read the reviews on this product and decided to order it. This works beautifully.  It truly is gentle soothing.  I use it day and night with absolutely no irritation, and my skin stays soft.  You actually get quite a bit of product in the container, so it is a good deal as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very hydrating here in the dry cold.  Good for guys and gals-- smell is not obnoxious and very neutral.  It will likely last a good 3-4 months because you need so little</li>
