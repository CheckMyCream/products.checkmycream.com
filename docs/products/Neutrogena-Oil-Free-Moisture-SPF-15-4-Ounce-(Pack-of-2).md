      <li>But this is my new best friend for my face!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>The Walgreens version is a bit more viscous.</li>
      <li>Thank you neutrogena for making such wonderful products!</li>
      <li>AMAZON IS FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>Love this for my face.</li>
      <li>Very good, wife likes it, uses it daily.  </li>
      <li>I decided today to try the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturure, SPF 15, 4-Ounche Pump.  </li>
      <li>It did prevent me from getting sunburned though, and despite the greasy sunscreen feel, it was still fairly light.</li>
      <li>my skin fresh and healthy looking, without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>both responses said it was the old, good product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great face lotion that I&#x27;ve used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
      <li>short, this is more suitable for normal/dry skin types.</li>
      <li>Did a good job of keeping me from getting burned, even when I&#x27;m out in the sun for several hours.</li>
      <li>My face stays nice and fresh and soft all day.  </li>
      <li>It goes in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>In the last 6-9 months that I have switched to this regimen, I have had numerous people come up to me and tell what beautiful skin I have and what do I use.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS THE NEW BROAD SPECTRUM PRODUCT, NOT THE OLD GREAT ONE.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it definitely smells like sunscreen, which I have an aversion to.</li>
      <li>This may work better for someone with dry skin, as I have oily skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff really helps.  </li>
      <li>That also really helps cover up the pimples and its medicated.</li>
      <li>Really works too.</li>
      <li>but this goes on so smoothly and works into the skin instantly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Im gonna stop using and Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial Cleanser which used to work before</li>
      <li>I really like Neutrogena products, and I use a lot of them, but this one was a miss for me.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing to my dry skin, and most people think I look much younger than I am.  </li>
      <li>I have been using their oil-free moisturizer for combination skin for years underneath a separate Neutrogena sunscreen, so I thought I would give this a try to make my morning routine a little more efficient.</li>
      <li>AND I ARE 67 YEARS OLD AND</li>
      <li>I tend to be sensitive to sunscreen on my face</li>
      <li>I prefer Oil of Olay for sensitive skin with spf 15.</li>
      <li>getting very mistrustful of Amazon overall.</li>
      <li>A facial sunscreen for someone with oily/combination skin should probably contain Avobenzone as the main ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>I love having the SPF in it, and it&#x27;s not super thick like many other products.</li>
      <li>I generally get pretty dry skin in the winter months and this has done wonders with that.</li>
      <li>My face isnt as dry, it isnt stining and it isnt hurting as much.</li>
      <li>and I can barely use anything on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have woken up every morning with about seven new pussy, juicy zits; its really gross and Im embarressed to go out in public.</li>
      <li>I live in an extremely dry climate, Park City, Utah at an elevation of 7000 feet.  </li>
      <li>I have normal skin, but patches of dry skin pop up, especially in the winter.  </li>

<li> STINKS, IS TACKY, GREASY AND HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURE. THIS IS THE NEW BROAD SPECTRUM PRODUCT, NOT THE OLD GREAT ONE. IT STINKS, IS TACKY, GREASY AND HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;I did post a question and both responses said it was the old, good product.  So guess I won&#x27;t be trusting question/answers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting very mistrustful of Amazon overall.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as one of the many on my quest to find an SPF product that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like an oil slick, and needless to say I was disappointed. Same old story here - the formulation is too emollient and especially uncomfortable in warm weather. Would I use it in a pinch? Yes, but only if it came down to this or a tub of Vaseline. A facial sunscreen for someone with oily/combination skin should probably contain Avobenzone as the main ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is more suitable for normal/dry skin types.</li>
    <li> I usually like Neutrogena products, but this one irritates my eyes for some reason. I prefer Oil of Olay for sensitive skin with spf 15.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE ONLY SKIN CARE I USE AND MY SKIN AND I ARE 67 YEARS OLD AND ALMOST PERFECT!(SMILE) NEVER NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE SUN!(SPF 15)  THE NICE THING ABOUT MY PURCHASE IS THAT i WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE SENT THE PRODUCT EVERY SIX MONTHS. NO MORE RUSHING AROUND TO FIND IT. AMAZON IS FANTASTIC! I AM THRILLED!   THANK YOU!  NormaJeanne</li>

    <li> Molly (daughter of Richard)- Im a 22 year old female who has struggled with acne half of my life. Ive tried practically every thing there is. The only things that help my face are minocycline (a capsule), evolin .1% (a foam), and tazorac (a cream you put on night that leaves your face extremely dry, stiny and painful). I have tried soaps and moisturizors this week and none of them are working. The three medicines prescribed by my dermatologist havent kicked in yet. I used it last january and hadnt had a brokeout for ten months until my last period. I used Aveeno Ultra Calming Cleanser which Im gonna stop using and Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial Cleanser which used to work before but now its stopped working. I have woken up every morning with about seven new pussy, juicy zits; its really gross and Im embarressed to go out in public. I used Cetaphil and Eucerin neither which helped but exaccerbated it. I decided today to try the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturure, SPF 15, 4-Ounche Pump.  This is FINALLY WHAT IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR! Ived used it twice today and I already notice a difference! My face isnt as dry, it isnt stining and it isnt hurting as much. I also recommend Neutrogena Skin Clearing Makeup. That also really helps cover up the pimples and its medicated. Thank you neutrogena for making such wonderful products!</li>
    <li> its a great product and i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I can use on my skin that doesn&#x27;t make be break out into a rash!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  It is very soothing to my dry skin, and most people think I look much younger than I am.  I love it!  I have tried a couple other products over the years, but came back to Neutrogena.</li>

I don&#x27;t have oily skin but this goes on so smoothly and works into the skin instantly. Having an added bonus of SPF 15 is also very nice. So glad this is offered through Amazon at a great price and wonderful shipping.</li>
    <li> I really like Neutrogena products, and I use a lot of them, but this one was a miss for me. I have been using their oil-free moisturizer for combination skin for years underneath a separate Neutrogena sunscreen, so I thought I would give this a try to make my morning routine a little more efficient. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it definitely smells like sunscreen, which I have an aversion to. Upon putting it on my skin it felt greasy, and it didn&#x27;t really dry as it set in. I just felt greasy and gross all day, and I felt like my makeup was melting off of my face. This may work better for someone with dry skin, as I have oily skin. It did prevent me from getting sunburned though, and despite the greasy sunscreen feel, it was still fairly light. I, however prefer a drier, lighter sunscreen on my face.</li>
    <li> Very good, wife likes it, uses it daily.  Price has gone up, why?  When are you going to drop the price?</li>
    <li> Great product! I love having the SPF in it, and it&#x27;s not super thick like many other products. Really works too. I generally get pretty dry skin in the winter months and this has done wonders with that.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended an oil-free moisture to prevent clogged pores, so I&#x27;m waiting to see&lt;br /&gt;if this works.  It goes in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Hoping for the best!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is what it says. It&#x27;s a bit waterier than I would prefer however it does its job. As the directions say you really only need one pump. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;, it smells like cucumbers. So if that isn&#x27;t a scent you like, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is a great face lotion that I&#x27;ve used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my skin fresh and healthy looking, without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought the Walgreen&#x27;s knock-off product and I like it actually about the same.  The Walgreens version is a bit more viscous.</li>
    <li> Great all-purpose moisturizer/sunscreen.  Works for teens, too, and doesn&#x27;t make their face break out.</li>
    <li> Love this for my face. I have acne and I can barely use anything on my skin. When it gets dry and crazy looking, if I don&#x27;t have the right moisturizer, I just have to do without. But this is my new best friend for my face!! Will definitely order back up bottles!</li>
    <li> I live in an extremely dry climate, Park City, Utah at an elevation of 7000 feet.  I use this product twice a day and then Neutrogena Intensive at bedtime.  I have had great results.  In the last 6-9 months that I have switched to this regimen, I have had numerous people come up to me and tell what beautiful skin I have and what do I use.  I tell them immediately that it is the Neutrogena</li>
    <li> Works great. I tend to be sensitive to sunscreen on my face but this didn&#x27;t cause me a problem. Did a good job of keeping me from getting burned, even when I&#x27;m out in the sun for several hours.</li>
    <li> I heard it&#x27;s not good for ur skin. I use it on my feet sometimes.</li>
