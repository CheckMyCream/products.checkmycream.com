      <li>I love these things!</li>
      <li>Purchase these at your own risk.</li>
      <li>This is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got them again .</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why there are mixed reviews, they are awesome.</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>Had to reapply over waxed after to get hairs and ended up plucking more then I</li>
      <li>and they get more hair than i could tweezing alone.</li>
      <li>This make shaping your eyebrows so easy.</li>
      <li>Easy easy easy.</li>
      <li>Cheap and easy eyebrow management...so happy to find &#x27;em on amazon now that the local drug stores and grocers don&#x27;t have them.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>You need to make sure that you exfoliate your skin first.</li>
      <li>They recently stopped selling them in stores from so reason, so I was delighted to see that Amazon had them in stock.</li>
      <li>Works okay , but had use almost whole package.</li>
      <li>This saves me so much money!!</li>
      <li>My mom is very fair skinned, red hair blue eyes</li>
      <li>Possibly useful for wrapping packages, but it wholly inadequate to removing stray eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen makes a far superior similar product.</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>Not enough wax takes too many to do an eyebrow</li>
      <li>Also, my box came without instructions, so I am wondering if that is a packaging issue with the seller or if the product did not come with much instruction.</li>
      <li>it MIGHT take out one hair .. if you use the whole pack ..</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t really helpful.</li>
      <li>I never know how thick or thin to do them so these are easy and work perfectly</li>
      <li>had high hopes for these pre-shaped strips but after one try they went straight into the trash.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to use about two strips in order to remove a decent amount of hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The comments from other buyers that say these strips are like a piece of tape are accurate.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without these.  </li>
      <li>And no rash or irritation on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Other wise (depending on the amount of dead skin you have on your face) they probably wont work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your cash.</li>
      <li>Very minimally read for about 10 min, no irritation and really you don&#x27;t even feel it!!</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are a bit fine and soft in texture, yet I found the wax to be incredibly weak and the shape of the eyebrow shaper wasn&#x27;t much of a shape at all.  </li>
      <li>Barely any stick, felt like scotch tape.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>One hint from experience if you go over the same spot multiple times it will start to remove your skin, I completely blame that on user error not the product.</li>
      <li>I was not sure if I would like it and did not know if it was something I was going to be able to do without making a mess of my brows.  </li>
      <li>I usually use Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip for my brows, but those need to be trimmed to the arc you want and can get kind of sticky, but at least the remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> Waste money.</li>
<li> what waste of time and money ......</li>
<li> So much faster, easier and less painful than plucking one by one.  </li>
<li> They don&#x27;t hurt as bad as a wax strip, but they also don&#x27;t exactly match up wit the shape of my brow.</li>
<li> These hardly remove any hair.</li>
<li> They are painful to use, and the shape of the strips is odd.</li>
<li> Pathetic n useless do not buy it</li>
<li> do not buy this , wish I hadnt :(</li>
<li> I hate plucking my eyebrows</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> wasn&#x27;t really helpful. Didn&#x27;t remove or shape my eyebrows even after proper precleaning, and removing of oils. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t purchase these.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use.  I was not sure if I would like it and did not know if it was something I was going to be able to do without making a mess of my brows.  It works great and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are a bit fine and soft in texture, yet I found the wax to be incredibly weak and the shape of the eyebrow shaper wasn&#x27;t much of a shape at all.  I feel like I wasted my money on this product even though it was only a few bucks. Also, my box came without instructions, so I am wondering if that is a packaging issue with the seller or if the product did not come with much instruction.</li>
    <li> Hit or miss. Sometimes it removes hair, the majority of the time it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I had looked for these everywhere. I have no idea why there are mixed reviews, they are awesome. Anyone can use them. I have corse hair and it removed it with no problem. My mom is very fair skinned, red hair blue eyes and I did her eye brows and it worked great!! Very minimally read for about 10 min, no irritation and really you don&#x27;t even feel it!! I am signed up for subscribe and save!! This saves me so much money!! I don&#x27;t have to go the salon anymore and get them waxed!!</li>
    <li> Cheap and they get more hair than i could tweezing alone. They don&#x27;t hurt as bad as a wax strip, but they also don&#x27;t exactly match up wit the shape of my brow. I&#x27;m petite, with child-sized facial features, Haha! I just use 2 in different positions to make up for that. I usually just go in near the center arch of my brow and grab any remaining hairs with the tweezers.</li>
    <li> this is like a piece of scotch tape .. I tried every suggestion , doing it twice each area , heating it up with dryer etc etc .. TOTAL JUNK .. if you use scotch tape you will get the same result . it MIGHT take out one hair .. if you use the whole pack .. what waste of time and money ...... do not buy this , wish I hadnt :(</li>
    <li> Possibly useful for wrapping packages, but it wholly inadequate to removing stray eyebrows. Sally Hansen makes a far superior similar product.</li>
    <li> I love these. I have been using them for years. Easy easy easy. One hint from experience if you go over the same spot multiple times it will start to remove your skin, I completely blame that on user error not the product.</li>
    <li> This make shaping your eyebrows so easy.</li>
    <li> Not enough wax takes too many to do an eyebrow</li>
    <li> Works okay , but had use almost whole package. Had to reapply over waxed after to get hairs and ended up plucking more then I waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleansed and exfoliated and dried my face really well before hand to remove any oil off skin and hairs. Still didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product I&#x27;m so happy that I found it on Amazon they used to sell them in cvs but stopped selling them for whatever reason I&#x27;m so glad I got them again . I hate plucking my eyebrows I never know how thick or thin to do them so these are easy and work perfectly</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work. Waste money.</li>
    <li> I usually use Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip for my brows, but those need to be trimmed to the arc you want and can get kind of sticky, but at least the remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for these pre-shaped strips but after one try they went straight into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;1. The arch of the brow is to wide, there&#x27;s no way to get the defines brows like the image on the box.&lt;br /&gt;2. Barely any stick, felt like scotch tape.&lt;br /&gt;3. Removed 0 hairs from my brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your cash.</li>
    <li> My daugher (13) and I can&#x27;t live without these.  So much faster, easier and less painful than plucking one by one.  And no rash or irritation on my very sensitive skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. If you like a natural-but-groomed look, this is all you need.</li>
    <li> These hardly remove any hair. I have to use about two strips in order to remove a decent amount of hair. The comments from other buyers that say these strips are like a piece of tape are accurate. They are painful to use, and the shape of the strips is odd. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing these again. Purchase these at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years! They recently stopped selling them in stores from so reason, so I was delighted to see that Amazon had them in stock. A lot of people just try applying these and expect them to work, when that is not the case. You need to make sure that you exfoliate your skin first. Other wise (depending on the amount of dead skin you have on your face) they probably wont work. A box of these lasts me about a month.</li>
    <li> Pathetic n useless do not buy it</li>
