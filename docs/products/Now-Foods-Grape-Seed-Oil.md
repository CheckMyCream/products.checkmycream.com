<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it got stale real easy after opening it, i couldnt use the entire bottle, i would recommend getting a smaller bottle if you plan on using it less frequently, but for me it really didnt work much</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it&#x27;s not too oily/greasy after applying. I usually put this on at night.. great body oil as well!</li>
    <li> Love love love grapeseed oil and all natural skin products, will buy again skin feels wonderful</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did no one tell me about the wonders of grapeseed oil? It Is amazing. It makes my hair feel fantastic. It&#x27;s great on my skin. It&#x27;s the oil you never knew you needed. TRY IT!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hair, as well as for my skin. I love it when I can get more bang for my buck, and this product does just that.</li>
    <li> Not oily after using which I was worried  about.  Kind of hard to know if there is any real benefits to using, however, it is waht it says it is and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer instead of lotion because I actually think it does a better job. I have extremely dry skin, and this has dramatically improved my skins appearance and texture. I use this after shaving to put moisture back, and my legs have never been smoother. I also use this with lavander and tea tree oils to help my acne and moisturize my face. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and it&#x27;s full of vitamin E.</li>
    <li> this is not cooking oil, but for the face.  oops!</li>
    <li> I got the grape seed oil to use on my skin because I get a lot of dry patches, especially in the rougher seasons. There are other alternative uses like for cooking, but I focus on the skin care. It helps on contact but sustainability is a little more lax than I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s odorless so you&#x27;re not worried about smelling or being too fragrant like a lot of mainstream products. It&#x27;s not heavy either so it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. My mother suggested trying to mix it with other products to see if that helped trap the moisture in my skin longer. I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up the grape seed oil altogether because it did work. I found that using the grape seed oil mixed with jojoba oil was the best for me ([[ASIN:B00NUDJ820 Jojoba Oil for Hair and Skin - 100 Percent Pure Cold Pressed Oil - No Fillers, Dyes or Artificial Ingredients of Any Kind - Made in the USA (3 bottles - 4 oz each)]]). Combining the two left me smoother longer and my skin wasn&#x27;t clogged or anything. Great find and I&#x27;m happy I took others&#x27; advice to figure it out.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this and I was skeptical but ordered it anyway because my 4 yr old has eczema and I was desperate.  It worked wonders, and my daughter said \\&quot;Mommy, it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the medicine the doctor gives me!\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> clear odorless oil, i use it as body oil and massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;good product! totally worth the $$ :)</li>
    <li> Nice light oil, I used it in my hair and on my extremely dry skin. It wasn&#x27;t too greasy like most oils and absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this is a favorite of mine. I love products that serve more than one purpose.  It&#x27;s light enough to use on my face to seal in moisture as well as my hair. It is also excellent for removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Large bottle for a good price! I blended it with Shea butter and coconut oil to make body butter and it turned out nicely.</li>
    <li> I use grapeseed oil as a hot oil treatment for my hair, and as a moisturizer for my skin.  I purchase two of these bottles and loved the results so much I shared half of the bottle with my cousin.  I will most definitely repurchase this oil.</li>
    <li> I put this on before I go to bed and wake up with very soft skin. Even though it is an oil, it is a very &#x27;light&#x27; oil. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any other benefits other than the soft skin.</li>
    <li> Really great value. I love just a touch of this product in my hair. I like the natural, healthy, and nice results of grape seed oil on my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> use on face for make-up removal. love it</li>
    <li> I love it. Its light amd moisturizing. I use this for my homemade body and hair butters.</li>
    <li> I love this oil as it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when I apply it and no strong odor.  I prefer this over Neutrogena Sesame oil.</li>
    <li> High quality oil, big value for the price. Quick shipping. Very happy with this product. A little goes a long way. Will shop here again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use alone as well as to mix with unrefined Shea Butter. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would have a scent to it and it does not. It works wonderfully as a skin moisturizer and I use it for both my body and my hair. I have dry skin and this product worked very well to keep my skin hydrated through out the day. It also has worked well in my Shea Butter mixture to help make it more pliable. I haven&#x27;t used it for cooking but because this is also food grade it could be used for that purpose. This is a great value for the money especially because it has multiple uses which is great in these interesting economic times.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Good shipping time, great product.  The cap was cracked on arrival, but since it is sealed there was no leakage and no harm done.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a waterproof eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;Although it does take off the makeup (as with any oil), it&lt;br /&gt;irritated my eyes.  At bedtime, my eyes would water profusely.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised, since it&#x27;s supposed to be so pure and light.&lt;br /&gt;May not clog pores, but take care around the eyes.  But I do pat this&lt;br /&gt;on a damp face when my skin gets dry and flaky (I actually have oily skin).&lt;br /&gt;Does do a good job with making skin soft and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Light weight oil! perfect for anything</li>
    <li> I was using this for the oil cleansing method, which I decided was making my skin worse. HOWEVER, this oil seems to be very good quality and I now use it as a moisturizer after shaving. It is very lightweight and moisturizing and the scent it subtle. I will continue to use this product, just not for what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time. I add this oil to my body lotions and its make it that much better.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural oil for making moisturizer, scalp and skin treatment or for burning fragrant oils. Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> This was a great oil to seal ends as well light enough for my skin and sometimes lips! I t gave my hair luster and relieved some itching on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great product for skin care</li>
    <li> I am usually very happy with NOW products, but this one I have concerns about. The description or bottle doesn&#x27;t say whether it is expeller pressed or pressed with hexane or another chemical. Most reputable products will have this information listed. I wonder if this has been processed in a way that is detrimental to the quality of the product. It does make a great skin moisturizer. You can find organic grapeseed oil for much cheaper on other web sites.</li>
    <li> Great oil to use for essential oils!</li>
    <li> Love this I use it for my hot oil treatment and it works great my hair is also growing and I swear it&#x27;s because if this .</li>
    <li> I like this oil. Its light and easily absorbed into the skin. I use it on my toddler and it keeps his skin supple all year round.</li>
    <li> love this stuff going to buy more soon to create a oil mix. Shipping was fast so i am now a repeat customer</li>
    <li> oil is great, stays moist and don&#x27;t need to reapply often. I know several massage therapists that use grape seed oil. highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a great product and a great price. The transaction was easy and the product arrived quickly and safely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a skin moisturizer. My skin is very dry and most lotion formulas have proving to be unsuccessful for me. I started using this immediately after showering, and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized for the remainder of the day. I&#x27;m not ashy at the end of the day. I actually like this better than coconut oil as a moisturizer for the body. It may be too heavy to use on the face. I&#x27;ll try it on my hair next.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE!!!! This was my first time trying this oil and I am so glad I did!  It is light with no smell and mixed great with my Shea butter.</li>
    <li> I am glad I invested in grape seed oil.  Its absorbs into the skin well and leaves the skin soft.  I actually brought it to mix with my homemade hair oils.  Also added some to My shea butter skin concoction.  So far, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth, odorless oil that is perfect for mixing with different essences...lavender, chamomile, sandalwood.  For massage, it spreads very thinly and quickly - in my mind, perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great cooking oil for higher heat and doesn&#x27;t add any flavor you don&#x27;t want to your food.</li>
    <li> My family just uses this for moisturizer. I hate the lotions out there on the market, I always end up feeling greasy and gross. This stuff is natural and absorbs quickly. Excellent for myface after shaving.</li>
    <li> Item got here much faster than the estimeated arrival date, quality is fantastic, glides on smoothe and my sknin feels like silkly. I use grape seed oil in my whipped shea butter, which I use on my skin and hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with sensitive skin my entire life! Tried every product I could find on the market to take care of my skin. The best regimen I have found is this organic grapeseed oil as a carrier oil. I put different essential oil blends in it and use it for skincare. It is working very well for my teenage daughter also! This item is essential to my regimen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for sauteing, dressings, and massages. All in all, this is a great product; odorless for massages, great taste for cooking. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have been using it as a facial moisturizer for several months now, and my skin has reacted well to it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I use it as moisturizer for my skin. However, if you use this everyday as a full body moisturizer the bottle starts to get really messy and oily from having to pick it up repeatedly with oily hands - I would love it I could get this in a pump-style bottle!</li>
    <li> I heard about using Grapeseed oil, as a moisturizer, by a celebrity. So, I went and bought my own. I used it on my legs in the morning..people thought I was wearing nylons! It gives a moisturizing, sheen..without the greasiness. I use it sparingly on my face, at night..even during the day as a primer (it is abit dewy on the face, not greasy, but enough that it reflects light&#x3D; glow) it feels soo good and my skin is smoother. My grandmother is now hooked, too! Ofcourse, it&#x27;s awesome because you can eat it too. Think about it, you absorb what you put on your skin. May as well be something edible! Just make sure it isn&#x27;t over-refined kind of Oil. I think raw is most beneficial. Alittle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil its gentle and doesnt clog pores. Ive replaced my old face moisturizer with this, and so far my skin is clearer and not dry or oily.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my skin... except maybe make it look greasy. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, though, so take my review with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> Absorbs nicely. Pleasant mild smell. Used regularly for massage. Great price and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Does wonders for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Just right size and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement while using product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for my kids for years.  It&#x27;s awesome because it&#x27;s not greasy. I use it all over their body even their hair.  I use it on me and my husband.  Haven&#x27;t tried cooking with it yet, but it&#x27;s great for the skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  This is a wonderful product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very happy with oil,i used it with other oils for my hir and skin,it is light when used alone,but it is a very good oil to have in your collection.</li>
    <li> Super fast Shipper! Great quality product</li>
    <li> This oil is just like any other oil. It is slick, greasy, and not quickly absorbed when applied to the skin. I was also hoping to be able to cook with it, but the label promotes its skin conditioning abilities and only threw in one line about its edibleness. On here, it is marketed as Now Foods; however, the label that is on the bottle says Now Solutions. I am a bit confused. I will continue using it only on my skin and hair, but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use this product for a face moisturizer and I love it. I have acne prone skin and grape seed oil feels thick but doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I have read that it makes your you pores smaller. Just remember a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I add this to all my soaps and love it. Google the effective qualities if you are not familiar. I applied directly to 3 burns and have no scars left and 1 place had blistered and opened. It has anti bacterial and healing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn Dennis</li>
    <li> I used this for my hair, but he result was not what I expected. However, I&#x27;ve used this for cooking in the past, and it&#x27;s great. Recommend using for COOKING only!</li>
    <li> Amazing and fabulous .. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a massage oil during labor because the description said that it is food grade, un-scented, and absorbs quickly. Tested it out last night and all seems to be true! It stayed nice and slick during the massage but was absorbed quickly into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. And there is definitely no scent, which I love. Seems to be a good oil.</li>
    <li> Brought this with two other oils the bottles are pretty big , the oils are lite and absorbs in the skin quickly i forgot i was buying them for my hair after i seen how nicely it felt on my skin. You dont have to use a lot of it, so i use from head to toe literally love these oils. And Now Foods shipped quickly and clean no mess a definite reorder..</li>
    <li> This oil absorbs easily into the skin and has quickly become one of my favorite carrier oils. There is no scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve also been using this in soap products and so far I love the effects.</li>
    <li> I am a pro massage therapist and I love to use this oil because it barely has an odor and it is just the right thickness for massage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Now Foods about 1 1/2 weeks ago, and could not be happier with the results.  I had researched the benefits of grapeseed oil for hair and skin, and I am now a certified believer!!! My hair has never been so soft, and moisturized. Currently I use it about twice a week, and my shoulder length hair is beautiful! I also use the grapeseed oil on my face daily, and my skin looks like its getting younger and firmer already.  I also use the oil on my daughters hair and face, and any acne has cleared uo DRAMATICALLY. I will definitely be ordering this product again very soon. Shipping was very expedient and efficient.  Thank you Now Foods!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as lotion along with essential oils.  Perfect family size and light, absorbs well.  My son also has toddler eczema and this keeps his skin happy!  Great item!  (Perfect for babies too!).</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Grapeseed oil is my go to for cooking and skincare concoctions! Loving this bottle. It has a great lid. It&#x27;s nice to not spill a whole bottle if I -QueenClumsy- happen to knock it over.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have psoriasis in my elbows, knees and ankles, sometimes also in my scalp.  It is awesome to use right after showering.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and it is pleasant to smell.  Recently I doused the back of my head with it because the psoriasis was very itchy and spreading.  I kept it on overnight and then washed it (wash twice to get it all out)  My scalp feels so much better and as a bonus my hair is amazingly soft and shiny.  I completely recommend the oil also as a facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great for massage, a bit rough on the sheets.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for aromatherapy blends.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I had wrote a review, On this oil before and if you love using heat on your hair. This oil is a  perfect  heat protector.</li>
    <li> This very quickly got a rancid scent so I only used about a 10th of the bottle. Maybe a smaller bottle next time. I did like using it on my hair and it left it in good condition. Very disappointing at how quickly it seemed to spoil.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> As a note to anyone buying this product - I emailed NOW to ask about how the product is processed and received the following reply: \\&quot;The grapeseed oil is extracted with hexane, the hexane is removed from the final product.\\&quot; After researching hexane extraction, there may still be very slight traces of hexane still in this product or other hexane processed products. Just a note to those looking to buy since this information was not included anywhere on the label.</li>
    <li> Great and inexpensive.  I use as a carrier oil</li>
    <li> I use it as a carrier oil and skin freshener.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and use it in a rub I make for pain relief.</li>
    <li> This is a  great oil for soap making and skin protection too,I enjoy it,it is the first time I use it .good seller worth to buy it,</li>
    <li> This is a super item to use in your skin, it&#x27;s very hydrating and gives me a glow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had grape seed oil before, is it supposed to smell rancid?  This product was gross, I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Love this oil Works great on my hair as a sealant</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to something to moisturize but not end up greasy.  This wasn&#x27;t it.  It just sits on my skin.  I then mixed it with jojoba oil, neroli hydrosol, aloe gel, a tad of shea and beeswax thinking that a lotion like this would decrease the greasiness.  NOT!  It still just sits on my skin, and I have to wipe it off or it gets on everything.  Disappointing but it is food grade, so I will cook with it.  Not a total loss!  Still looking for that holy grail natural moisturizer without grease!</li>
    <li> So fantastic and lightweight! I use it alone, in my moisturizer concoctions, and as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This oil is everything I hoped it would be, I could definitely say it met my expectations!! I use it on my skin and it has my skin feeling moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> i love this product but i would not buy it again because the description or bottle doesn&#x27;t say whether it is expeller pressed or pressed with hexane or another chemical. The other now product oils that are expeller pressed brag about it, and this one doesn&#x27;t mention it which makes me curious.</li>
    <li> very light weight, great for sealing moisture without weighing hair down</li>
    <li> Using this as a carrier oil for essential oils.  It goes a long way and does not have any kind of poor smell.  It is not exceptionally greasy for being an oil.</li>
    <li> Great oil. I use it as a heat protectant.</li>
    <li> This oil is all natural and I use it both in recipes (delicious with no unpleasant aftertaste) and as a skin moisturizer after I shower. It&#x27;s not too oily, absorbing very well while protecting. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for my hair as part of my deep condition routine however I find that it is too light. It is also processed. I now use regular dark green grapeseed oil for my hair. I am using up this bottle and use it to seal my skin after I use a nice moisturizing lotion. The winters here are cold and thus with the heat on it creates low humidity and skin can quickly get dry and itchy so this has been helpful for the body.</li>
    <li> very good oil, easy to absorb.</li>
    <li> I added it to a spray bottle with some water and do a light misting once out of the shower- my skin has never been this soft! Will continue to purchase and use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it as a base for my oil cleansing!</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews and doing some researching, I&#x27;m so glad I tried this.  Purchase this for my skin and my natural hair, been using for about a month....LOVE IT!! My skin is moisturized without feeling greasy, and my hair is hydrated.  Overall, I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item last month, but wanted to see how my skin reacted to it before I wrote a review. I can now say that I am in love with this product. I use this at night in order to moisturize my skin. Although I have combination skin, my skin did not feel oily when I woke up. I just simply pour a dime size amount onto my palms and pat the oil onto my skin. It does not clog my pores as well, and I do not break out anymore after using this. Love, love, love this product! I will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product! Does not leave my face greasy!!!</li>
    <li> I used this oil on my body and hair.  It leaves your skins soft and not too greasy.  I am perm free and add 1 tsp of grapeseed oil to my yogurt conditioner.  Leave it in my hair fr 2 hours.  My hair is growing, it&#x27;s softer and I see less breakage.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Nice and light, absorbs quickly with no greasy residue. I use it in the products I make that are more geared towards anti-aging (or acne prone) as its astringent properties are good for tightening and toning skin.</li>
    <li> On time delivered, and the quality it tooo much.</li>
    <li> 4.75 stars out of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your first fried egg with this oil will tell you why grapeseed oil is the frier&#x27;s choice of oils.  There&#x27;s no waxy taste.  For that reason alone, your first italian vinergrette will blow you away, light and tasty.  Hey, I might eat more salads this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your first french fry will tell you why you should use this oil; the 400+ degrees to sear the outside and not soak into the potato.  The oil doesn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; taste like some others.  After frying fish, I can filter the oil and not even know it was used to fry fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if you needed more reasons, the biggest one of all: grapeseed oil matches Fish oil in Omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s.  When you don&#x27;t like that fish oil burp, use grapeseed oil.  Did I mention it has no taste, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer in this oil.  My LDL&#x27;s are down and HDL&#x27;s are up.  My Heart thanks you. My eyesight thanks you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last point about the purple bottle.  It has a pop-top to dispence the oil.  So, you can use as little or as much as you need.  I keep mine on the stove to remind me I can have some whenever I need oil in cooking.  Because the oil is good for me, I use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just needed to convince myself to add a drop on my hands to fix those dry cracked fingers.  Surprise, surprize: It worked better than I imagined.  What else can I used this OIL for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a down side to all this good. It&#x27;s not the cheapest oil to cook with.  But hey, I&#x27;m still using it for the \\&quot;lack\\&quot; of taste, high frying temperature, and most of all, for what my doctor likes about what it&#x27;s done to my LDL/HDL numbers and improved eyesight (up to 20/40 from 20/200). So, it might be a few dolars more.  I think I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
    <li> Never knew this could calm my external hemorrhoids, I am applying this oil once a day and my hems get smaller until they are gone! (but they come back tho, but i will just apply it again and they will be gone!) I love it! 10/10</li>
    <li> I used this product on my skin, I use it for scrubs, lotions, soap, and fizzy bombs for the bath.</li>
    <li> Love the oil but oil dripped during delivery.</li>
    <li> I love grape seed oil. It feels really good on my skin and I also use it for my hair treatments. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Product shipped in excellent condition. Looks just like in the store only at a much cheaper price. I will definitely order from this user again in the future! I am pleased with the product as I use grape seed oil  quite often. Thanks Now!</li>
    <li> Good oil that I use for a preshave oil mixture. The bottle claim they protect the essential oils from light but I really don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. You can never go wrong with an all natural cold pressed oil. My hair loves it. I hear it works really well on skin to.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face moisturizer and also to soften up my beard! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily at all! I would use it in my hair, but alas, I am bald. :)</li>
    <li> Used this as an unscented oil to dilute fragrance oils. It worked as expected.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous. I no longer use soap and have started an OCM.The grape seed oil leaves my 38 year old combination skin feeling soft and not greasy. My complexion is clear and my skin has that healthy glow. This is the safest and cheapest beauty bet you can make. Stop all that nasty makeup and just take care of your skin ladies!</li>
    <li> it was a good product and would recommand to friends and family</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star review because I have thick very curly hair, and I use this oil mixed with a bit of castor oil over my leave in to tame my curls. It works really well, and keeps my hair moist and soft, not to mention frizz free. If you have fine hair, it will be great alone, because it is a light oil, persons with thicker hair can mix it with a heavier oil if they so desire. Either way, alone or mixed, it is amazing. I love it!</li>
    <li> excellent oil that we use for cooking and body massage. the shipping was great and I am very pleased and will order again this product again</li>
    <li> No complaints here. Arrived on time, packaged well. I used this for my face. Does a good job of removing makeup! I&#x27;d buy again. Love NOW products (:</li>
    <li> Sometimes you want to taste the oils and sometimes you don&#x27;t.  This one doesn&#x27;t add any flavor to foods let allows you to sear meats quickly at high temps.</li>
    <li> Beauty and food grade oil, only used for the latter. Cooking eggs, ribeye, veggies, etc. Also used it to clean adhesive off of my car (no joke). Versatile stuff.</li>
    <li> I heard about this oil on a hair blog and decided to try it. Now it has become my favorite oil to seal my hair with and to put in my facial cleanser, which is my own version of oil cleansing.  It leaves my face feeling clean and supple. It&#x27;s lightweight but very moisturizing. The package is always shipped timely and I have never received a leaking bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the seller. Would buy this product again. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use as a pre-conditioning treatment to my hair.  I was a little skeptical in the beginning, but my hair loves it.  I use it to pre-condition as well as to seal the ends of my hair.  As a result, I didn&#x27;t need a trim for 12 weeks.</li>
    <li> Use this instead of lotion after showering. My skin feels soft!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and have been using it for massages ever since. It has a great texture and is great for skin. It stays moist while not being too sticky. It honestly is just a great product. The price is also pretty cheap. I shopped around for a little while and settled on this because of the price and from what I&#x27;ve hear about grapeseed oil, and I was not disappointed. Good product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get used to the smell. It smells like pure vegetable oil ... Isn&#x27;t it supposed to be light smell?</li>
    <li> I use the grape oil for mixing with herbs because it doesn&#x27;t have any smell or taste to mix with the herb. I don&#x27;t know if there is a better brand as I&#x27;m not an expert in grape oil.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair skin and face. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer and sinks in fast.  It&#x27;s not oily on my skin at all but on my hair it will look and feel oily if I use too much.  It &#x27; s an excellent sealant for my relaxed hair. I ordered the large bottle this time.</li>
    <li> Easy to rub on.  Grape seed oil has a light scent.  It helps to combine this oil with stronger oils such as jojoba or emu.  Grape seed soaks into the skin well after showering.</li>
    <li> This is a very healthy oil to cook with, and it can withstand high temperatures, unlike most cooking oils. You can also use it for cold salad dressings, body massage oil, or as a facial moisturizer. It will NOT clog your pores! It may feel oily at first, but is absorbed pretty well, so you don&#x27;t feel greasy. There is absolutely no odor to it, as well.</li>
    <li> The plastic cap is really thin and cheap. It arrived broken and could not be used. But the paper seal under the cap was tight to prevent spilling. So I poured the contents into an empty water bottle. I don&#x27;t know yet how well the product works,</li>
    <li> Works well on my dry winter skin.  I keep a small cruet of the oil on the counter near the sink and use it on my hands after doing pots and pans or other cleaning jobs that require putting my hands in water.  Keep the rest of the bottle in the shower and use it on arms and legs after showering.  Creams and lotions weren&#x27;t working well for me.  I got the idea of using oil after having a manicure several times.  The  manicurist always used oil on my hands and arms before polishing my nails.  Wow! what a difference.  I tried regular grape seed oil from the super market, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  The Now oil is odorless and I can use cologne or sented cream after I use the oil.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a massage oil for my wife. We have really enjoyed this oil. Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
    <li> We are repeat customers who use this Grape seed oil to remove makeup, soften skin, heal damage. No complaints at all. Ships fast and arrives safe.</li>
    <li> It appears this is for external use, such as massage. It came from now foods so I assumed it was for cooking. But the bottle promotes every use BUT cooking.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. I use it primarily use it to moisturize my hair and skin.  It leaves my skin smooth and soft.  I use it in combination of other oils.  I have always included natural oils in my hair and skin care regimen. I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I really enjoy it on my skin. No smell for those who can&#x27;t stand scents.I will buy again and give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light moisturizer, particularly for my undereye area(I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have noticed some not-great stuff going on there). I ended up using this all over my face and even in my hair. It moisturizes wonderfully and my undereye area looks a little brighter somehow. No unpleasant scent. I have normal to dry skin and I find that it&#x27;s nicely moisturizing without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product good value.</li>
    <li> I use Grapeseed oil as a carrier oil for my Young Living Essential Oils</li>
    <li> My skin has been flaking horribly for the past year or so. No moisturizing creams worked. A mixture of this grapeseed oil, plus almond and sesame oil (formulated for the skin) in the mornings, (along with l&#x27;occitane pure shea butter in the evenings) has been the answer. My skin flaking problem is 95% improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grape seed oil is the lightest of the food oils I&#x27;ve used (lighter than almond or sesame).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for use under makeup, but it can make your powder brush a bit oily.</li>
    <li> I love Now Brand Grape seed Oil. It is very light and fragrance free which makes it perfect for a carrier oil. I can add fragrance oils to it and they bind well with this oil. This oil also absorbs into the skin very well. I also enjoy cooking with it as it is a much healthy oil than vegetable oil.</li>
    <li> Not too sure what this oils does for the hair but I did watch a video of a young lady using it as a deep moisture agent when added to a deep conditioning for the hair so I followed was not disappointed with the results I have to do my research the young lady did mention the benefits I just forgot sorry ladies and amazon</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and excema, so this oil is definitely for me. It&#x27;s not too thick or greasy, but of course you want to let it soak in before applying makeup. I use this in the morning, and Hemp Oil on my face at night (the Hemp oil is much more greasy, so it&#x27;s a good night time skin product), and I definitely see the benefits. My skin looks soft and smooth. The oil has a very light, but pleasant smell. A little goes a long way, so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle in my cupboard at all times. It is food grade but I don&#x27;t put it in food that often. I mostly use it to mix into Shea or Cocoa butter, or to do oil cleaning on my skin. It has worked great on my child&#x27;s skin as well during severe chapped days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also make a home made body scrub with it. I use sugar, honey and avocado oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I add to salads for the health benefits.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for whatever you use it for. If you are going to use it for massage I recommend putting it in the microwave for a few seconds to get it warm.</li>
    <li> i use this oil daily as part of my skin care regimen for my rosacea.  combined with the evening primrose oil, they both work extremely well.</li>
    <li> Perfect oil for fine, easily weighed down hair!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff and swears by it... although she can be a bit of a fanatic about all this &amp;#34;healthy alternative&amp;#34; trendy stuff... she puts it on every time she gets out of the shower or the tub and the dogs get really excited and always try to lick it off of her so apparently they like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it myself but im not really into walking around all oily when id rather just be dry... it didnt seem to work any better than regular old body lotion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference in how this oil makes my hair feel but it&#x27;s a good oil period</li>
    <li> My favorite oil to use on my skin I was happy to find it cheap for this size grear moisturizer love on my skin highly recommend if ur not the type of person that likes to add harsh products on face body or hair</li>
    <li> like a lot, very light</li>
    <li> I purchased other Items with this brand.  Not at all impressed.  Non of them have a scent it seems as though they are all the same oils with color added to them to make them seem different.</li>
    <li> NOW  oils are very high quality.. I oder them over and over again</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Grape seed oil is great as it does not leave an oily film like some other oils.</li>
    <li> Trying, got for essential oils as a carrier, but was closer than the olive oil when cooking the other day so tried it, added a light delightful flavor to my dinner. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Grape Seed oil is easily one of my favorite carrier oils because of the silky soft finish, and this time was no exception. This was my first time purchasing grape seed from NOW Foods (normally a PT loyalist) but I was not disappointed. The pop lid makes it easy to pour into my roll on bottles, and this oil worked fabulously in my lotion bars. Shipping was quick and efficient, and overall I have no complaints. In fact, I just might give their EOs a try now that I&#x27;ve come to enjoy their almond and grape seed carrier oils so much....</li>
    <li> Great oil as a carrier for other essential oils. Also works awesome by itself as a natural moisturizer. I will definitely be buying this again and again. I also like the viscosity of it and that it absorbs into your skin quickly without a lot of greasy residue.</li>
    <li> such a great deal and huge amount for the price. I will buy this oil on amazon for now on.</li>
    <li> Perfect product I use it on my hair and skin. I use it in my cooking as well. Thinner than cooking oils. I love its versatility.</li>
    <li> Good price for a base oil.  Bottle is not photo proof like other brands</li>
    <li> This grape seed oil is a really great moisturizer both for my Hair and skin. I have a very dry and flaky scalp but ever since I started using the oil, I haven&#x27;t had any flaking.</li>
    <li> Grape seed oil is fantastic for skin and hair, I read reviews and thought it might help with my dry skin/ dermatitis. I put it on along my hair line in the shower before I wash my hair. It&#x27;s really helped! And my skin/hair aren&#x27;t oily during the day. I highly recommend:)</li>
    <li> The headline pretty much says it all! I also use it with my msm lotion as a moisturizer for all over. This bottle lasts a long time! Will be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> Use this in combination with the same brand of Avacado oil.  Keeps skin very hydrated, even my dermatologist remarked how well hydrated my skin is ( the derm student that was there asked me what I use)  Does not cause break outs as many would think being an oil product.  There is no sent which is just what I wanted, with the Avacado and Grape Seed Oils together I am getting lifting and firming  that I have not had in years, more even skin tone, no dry patches .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using for 3 months now and have only used about 1/4 bottle so this size is a great value.</li>
    <li> I use this as the main component of my daily moisturizer and it works great! Absorbs well and deeply moisturizes, even in winter weather!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for the past two-three weeks and so far I like it.  I use it as a body oil, works better when I apply it to damp skin.  I have applied it to my sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritate my skin any further.  I even used this to remove makeup and it does a great job for that purpose.  I have not applied it to my hair often because honestly I have so many oils in my possession that I need to finish before using this.  Personally I prefer apricot seed oil but I purchased this because it was a touch cheaper.  I will repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Grape Seed Oil for years, but sparingly. It is about the 1/2 the price of what it is in the grocery store for that amount. Usually only 8oz in the store. I use this to cook with and as a carrier oil for other therapeutic oils. It has a higher burning temp and tastes good. When my hands are very dry or even a little cracked, I put this on them before I go to bed. It helps a lot and continued use will heal them.</li>
    <li> I love NOW products for my natural hair and natural products.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase NOW because the quality is great and so is the price!</li>
    <li> This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it in bath &amp; body products.  Fast shipping and perfect for my needs--thank you.</li>
    <li> A truly great product.  It is a very light oil that I use for body and hair.  it does not have a smell and it is helping me with extra shine and sealing in moisture after baths and hair washings.  As I use it in my hair it is very light oil and does not build up on my hair.  I believe you can also find this in wholefood but pretty sure not at the price you will find it here.  I recommend using it for body and hair. I have never used it on food.</li>
    <li> Ever since I stopped hormonal birth control about 6 months ago, I&#x27;d been having constant breakouts. This was unusual for me, and particularly problematic because of my super-sensitive skin. I was frustrated with going around looking like I&#x27;d hit some heretofore unknown second wave of puberty and at my wit&#x27;s end of what to do about it. Nothing seemed to be making a difference, and I was wasting money I didn&#x27;t have on products that were either not doing much or causing irritation and dryness (and still not doing much for the acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago I read about the potential benefits of grapeseed oil, remembered I had some buried in my toiletries cabinet, and decided to give it a try. I stopped all other products and used this to cleanse and moisturize my face. Within a few hours of the first application, the acne was less red and inflamed. Within a few days, the breakout was obviously subsiding, with no signs of problems to come. After a week, my skin looks and feels healthier than it has in years. There are only a few fading remnants of the last breakout, and my skin looks very fresh and supple. My dark undereye circles are also noticeably fading. I will update this review if anything changes, but for now, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this low-cost and effective skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is still the best skin care routine I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve gotten out of it. 3 primary reasons: it&#x27;s a pain to use when traveling, as you end up with oil all over your toiletries bag (even with my most-trusted leak-proof travel bottles); after a while, your face cloths all smell like slightly old oil; and in winter, I need more significant moisturizer. (While my skin never feels dry when using the grapeseed oil, cosmetics do not go on smoothly as they do when I&#x27;m using a more standard moisturizer--currently Keys Luminos, for those interested.) I do, however, live with some spots that I&#x27;m certain would be gone if I went back to the grapeseed oil. I&#x27;m keeping the five-star rating, because of the efficacy and quality of this oil.rating, because of the efficacy and quality of this oil.</li>
    <li> I always use NOW brand and this bottle size was a great deal that I would not pas by plus it is great as a skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this as a face lotion for at least 2 years and have no complaints, it&#x27;s not greasy therefore I found it works great for my hair and skin</li>
    <li> Completely switched up my face routine. I&#x27;ve used clinical prescribed acne medications for years and years. I just felt like I was not seeing any improvement no matter what topical, or antibiotic I was prescribed. I researched all natural ways to clear acne and grape seed oil was recommended by a lot of women so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is a little oily, I only use it at night and a little bit goes a long way!  It&#x27;s best known for calming redness and irritation which is the improvements I&#x27;ve seen so far. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now but I can see subtle changes in my skin. So far so good and I hope it continues to improve!</li>
    <li> I heard about this oil.  I found it priced less on Amazon than at local stores.  Its thinner than castor oil.  I use it on my body and a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a new skincare regimen since my skin is too sensitive to even use natural/organic products. I use this for cleansing and moisturizing. Just rub it on gently with a cotton ball and leave the residue. Absolutely amazing. I even put it on my hands before applying lotion at night and there&#x27;s a remarkable improvement in my dry skin. Amazing stuff. Will be using this the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> We got this for massage oil, and it is very very nice stuff. It is safe for all uses and it doesn&#x27;t make too large of a mess like some oils. Skin is noticeable softer after you let it soak up this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were able to heat it up in the container by running it under hot water. It didn&#x27;t leak at all from the dispenser top, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, it is odorless in my opinion. So it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you with perfumes and such, which can really detract from a relaxing environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really good stuff. My only issue is that for some reason our dog seems to like the taste of it, which is bad because grapes are potentially fatal for dogs.</li>
    <li> This Grape Seed Oil is virtually fragrance free &amp; light weight feels amazing on damp skin and I even used it in the hair as a treatment! Since its close to your skins own natural oil it won&#x27;t clog your pores. I mixed in a few drops of Now Brand essential oil for aromatherapy too! Good price for 16 oz - will buy again!</li>
    <li> ....think the title says it all...heard grape seed oil was a good lube and it certainly is.  My wife use to buy brand name stuff and we haven&#x27;t needed any since I purchased this...also great on your skin...I&#x27;ve even put some in my hair to reduce frizz...GRAPE SEED OIL IS AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> I use this religiously on my skin</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for making homemade sugar scrubs! This is super moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for so many ways, It last a long time!</li>
    <li> I bought to use as moisturizer and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for years and have struggled to find products test will clear flare ups. This works better than any prescription, over the counter, or natural product I have ever tried. It feels amazing on the skin and also works well with hair and nails. It can be used alone as a moisturizer, but I love using it on top on my lotion lock in moisture. Apparently, it has a slight grape smell that my boyfriend has commented on, yet he wears it almost daily now because of how well it works. Best part is, but I have extreme allergies and sensitive skin and this causes no type of irritation for me. I would highly recommend it to anyone struggling with skin issues.</li>
    <li> great to use with other oils!!!!</li>
    <li> very nice oil and a lot of it for a good price. i use it in soap making and lotion making.</li>
    <li> good oil. good for the skin</li>
    <li> I have very, very sensitive skin, so when I first heard that grapeseed oil is a wonderful moisturizer for the skin and hair, I researched the heck out of it.  I went to multiple sites and read countless reviews, and of those, only a very small percentage had any kind of a negative reaction, so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: It really is a great moisturizer for the hair.  Unlike some other oils - like coconut, for example - which are also great yet difficult to wash out, grapeseed oil delivers moisture to the scalp and hair, and is pretty easy to remove with a normal shampooing.  Afterward, I found my hair to be softer, more manageable, and not as dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for the not so good section of this review: when I first tried it on my face - which was experiencing a lot of dryness at that time - I used it sparingly.  It wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, and it seemed to sink into the skin very quickly.  My face became a little softer and a little bit less dry, and for a day or two, everything seemed fine.  After that, though, things went downhill in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be said that this won&#x27;t clog pores, but on me?  It clogged my pores.  Moreover, while I didn&#x27;t break out in giant pimples or anything like cystic acne, I did get many small pimples on, well, pretty much everywhere I had applied a little of the oil.  I didn&#x27;t want to give up and admit defeat so quickly since so many others had raved about this oil, so I chalked it up to my skin having to get used to it, and kept using a small amount once a day for a few more days.  That....was a mistake; not only did my breakouts not heal, I got more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, after that point, I stopped using the grapeseed oil, and slowly but surely, my face cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that point on, I&#x27;ve used it periodically as a hair treatment (making sure that none of it gets on my face during application or while I&#x27;m rinsing it out), and continue to get good results from that.  So, all of those who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin are liable to truly love the benefits of this oil on their skin and hair.  For those like me who tend to break out thanks to such irritants as air and tap water, I&#x27;d urge you to use caution when giving this a try.that.

    <li> This feels wonderful on my face.  I have very dry skin and my daughter recommended I try this.  It is great!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair moisturizer, as for skin I&#x27;ll stick to coconut oil. You. Get soft silky hair, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> Actually I read about so many different oils for face, body, hair or have you but I have not noticed a difference between this one and almond oil. It seems a little lighter if you will than avocado. I need to use these oils up quickly, drippy drip all over the sink and clothes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use in homemade body butter works nicely, mixes well with other oils.  Versatile product that I will always have in the cabinet.</li>
    <li> I really like grapeseed oil for messages and to add in my shea butter/lotions. It can also be used in hair. It is a medium texture, so it is does not leave the greasy feeling some other oils can leave such as olive oil, but it is not absorbed as quickly as say jojoba oil can be. I plan on ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> This oil is thinner than I was expecting.  I just finished up a bottle of castor oil so maybe I was expecting too thick but overall its a good oil.  I add it to shea butter and other oils to make my defining creams.  I will say that its a little oilier than i was expecting as well.</li>
    <li> I use as carrier oil for my essential oils</li>
    <li> It is so lightweight and soft. I just love it. Is good for skin and hair. It also has no odor which I like as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product for the very fact that it has very little to no scent. I was using coconut oil in my hair as a moisture sealant, but did not like the scent. I love coconut but I don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like one. Another pro feature of this oil is that it stays in liquid form, versus coconut oil, which solidifies when cool.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Helps with eczema.</li>
    <li> Mixes well with all products, or use it on it&#x27;s own! However, I&#x27;m also impressed with this company &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m pleased with all of their products I have purchased so far.</li>
    <li> Great oil and good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift so I don&#x27;t know how it will be received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for cooking eggs and would have to say they where excellent. I also have added a little bit to my liquid lemon flavored fish oil and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... now after reading a little more into it I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it is made to be used for cooking and or eating, since it says very little to that extent on the bottle. Everything on the bottle refers to hair and skin conditioner. There is like one line saying something to the extent that it is food grade. I&#x27;ve now stopped using it internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ll have to find another type to use since I don&#x27;t think I need to wash my whole body with oil, I was looking for something to cook with and maybe use on salads for a change. I think for something food grade I would rather see a few more things about how to use it for food rather then a whole label describing the skin and conditioner usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To bad since I really like Now Products, and have nothing bad to say about any of their past and present products.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t write a long review but if your not one for greasey and heavy oils then pick up this oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and adore how lightweight it feels on my hair (heat protected and adding shine) and face (softness). Has to be my favorite oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great multitask product I always have a bottle, I use it to remove makeup and to moisturize my hair and skin including my face. Great way to remove mascara without losing lashes or leaving makeup remover residue chemicals around my eyes. Once I week I massage it onto my scalp and hair and than leave it in for 20-30 minutes before shampooing it out and it makes my hair soft and shiny and helps reduce dry scalp itch. Almost no scent, lite oil that absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in hopes that it will help my under eye circles as some of the other reviews and articles I&#x27;ve read have stated. It seems to be working, but I won&#x27;t say they&#x27;ve completely faded away yet :-).</li>
    <li> the consistency, drying time and smell are great. Way better than lotion for hydration. Lasts longer too. I used it to dilute harispray</li>
    <li> I will use this product from now on...It seals in moisture but it isn&#x27;t too heavy on the hair.  Great heat protectant as well</li>
    <li> Love this oil! So many uses!</li>
    <li> Very light! I use it for my skin and hair!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of oils.  I put this on in the shower while still wet and allow a little time for it to absorb before putting my robe on.  By the time I put on my face lotion, comb out my hair and run the blow dryer for a little while, it is pretty well absorbed and I can dab the excess off with a towel before putting on my clothes.  It keeps my skin soft and holds in moisture better than any lotion has ever done.  I also like using coconut, sesame, almond and aura-glow formulas.  Once you start using oils, you&#x27;ll never go back to lotions.  This one has a light scent that is not noticeable after application.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very light and not greasy on the skin. Makes your skin feels soft and moist for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I am a 40+ woman and read the benefits of grapeseed oil for the face. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years now. Great for acne prone skin, great for wrinkles and great for toning the skin. Better than any high priced items in the department stores.</li>
    <li> We use this for a variety of different jobs in our house and it is a quality product that works well.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time with no leakage or packaging problems. The product itself has a very mild scent and a uniform texture &amp; color. It absorbs very quickly &amp; because it&#x27;s very light it spreads easily, so you need very little. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t organic but it is not tested on animals at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid 4/5</li>
    <li> Nice price for a 16 ounce bottle. I use grapeseed oil for skin care and this is a nice, non-greasy, pure oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just mix 1/4 cup of this with a cup of sugar, a squirt of lemon and a few drops of lavender essential oil for an amazing sugar scrub. Simply massage in small circles and rinse (it will feel a bit &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; until you buff dry with a towel). Your new &amp; rejuvenated silky smooth legs will thank you!</li>
    <li> Purchased for part of a hair treatment to restore moisture and it has worked wonders. Price was right and product was received on time which gave me a head start on treatments.</li>
    <li> Mixes well with essential oils. Not greasy. Great product! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> This all natural oil, put on after a shower, while skin is still slightly damp, is very effective, even for very dry skin--and it is far better than rubbing chemicals into your skin!</li>
    <li> I have tried all different body oils and for the price and value grapeseed oil is great! It has very minimal scent and isn&#x27;t too heavy compared to other oils I have tried. I will def buy this product again</li>
    <li> I use this oil as an after shower moisturizer.  It&#x27;s really nice and light my skin is definitely silkier since I started using the oil. I sometimes mix the grapeseed oil together with lotion for extra boost of hydration.I also ditched my hair oil and started using a little of this in my hair as well, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Great buy worth every penny very light oil easy to wash off and no sent to it , make my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s labelled for skin care, but we cook with it. It&#x27;s literally the same stuff. Nice container, but it&#x27;s a bit pricier than we can find in local stores.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great and oily right after use and soaks into the skin replenishing moisture where you need it</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It was my first time buying it, but I am familiar with the products from Now Foods.  So far so good.  It moisturizes my hair and skin without leaving a heavy film residue.</li>
    <li> my goodness.. what great benefits especially in the winter time.. I get really dry skin and this helps. I use it as a face moisture prior to make foundation or powder and it keeps my skin moisturized. good for dry skin and scalp.</li>
    <li> I use this for all types of homemade beauty products. I use this is a base for my essential oil mixtures. Great for both face and body!</li>
    <li> It leaked way to much have to find another essential in a darker amber bottle instead.</li>
    <li> great as a carrier oil for essential oils. I hate the smell of coconut, and this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> This product works if you use more then once a day.  It moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the itch from dry skin.  I probably will not purchase this again, and look further for a better product.</li>
    <li> Good value, and great for treating skin after a shower. I even used it to condition my shave after a shave.</li>
    <li> I have always been satisfied with all of the NOW products including the Grape Seed Oil</li>
    <li> I also have arthritis and I have to use this many times throughout the day.  My hands burns and gets very dry easily.  I like this because its very light and does not get all over my cell phone, computer etc.  It actually rubs in completely now residue left.</li>
    <li> Good price, nice quantity, product is very competitively priced for quality. Easy to use bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not more needs saying about this.</li>
    <li> I have tried this oil, mainly for cosmetic purposes. It seemed all right until I finally found out real cold-pressed grape-seed oil is actually green in color. But this one is yellowish, just the normal light cooking oil color. As another reviewer said, yes it may contain hexane which is a chemical solvent to extract the oil. I think you can just buy any grapeseed oil at grocery for a cheaper price. For cosmetic purposes,try to find a green oil indicated with \\&quot;cold-pressed\\&quot; in the label.</li>
    <li> Great for silky smooth, resurfaced skin! Great on nature hair as well!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, oil is very light,I like it.</li>
    <li> My wife recently decided to try the grape seed oil after trying and liking another Now brand of oil. She likes the grape seed oil because it is lightly scented and it it helps moisturize her skin without making her face feel oily and sticky. It absorbs quickly into her skin unlike other oils for the face as the oil is very light. A little oil goes a long way, so a this 16 ounce bottle will last a long time.  This is priced reasonably at 10 bucks here.  The wife uses this grape seed oil as a regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this brand of grape seed oil (or jojoba oil) daily to remove makeup, moisturize my face and body and use as a hair conditioning treatment. Does not clog my pores or break me out and I have finicky sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> good for scalp, hair &amp; body.</li>
    <li> Amazing on my face!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair mostly and it works great. It&#x27;s a lighter oil that leaves my hair soft, but never oily. It&#x27;s also great on my body, too. It&#x27;s very light, yet moisturizing, though it may be too light for some winter/cold climates. I also use this as a moisturizing oil in the oil cleansing method I use for my face and it works just fine. I also like that grapeseed oil is a natural heat protectant for hair.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my cold cream daily and my skin has never looked better. When it want a little color I mix this, my cold cream, a little liquid foundation and bronze powder and it gives a perfect, dewy glow.</li>
    <li> I received my Grape Seed Oil within one week and the product was packaged very well.  I use the product on my hair, skin and for cooking.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of this oil on my face and neck nightly and my skin looks so great, I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments without having makeup on! I got the 16 oz bottle without realizing it thinking that, for the price, it must be more like 5 ounces. Now I have this HUGE bottle of grapeseed oil and I believe I am fully stocked for the next year, because a little goes a looong way! Excellent product, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this says &amp;#34;now foods&amp;#34; when it is a skin care product.  It says it is food grade, but all the instructions are for skin care.  Confusing</li>
    <li> I put this in my daughters hair. Very moisturizing without being greasy. Not sure about skin care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this oil for a while, and there&#x27;s nothing I don&#x27;t like about it, honestly. I use it as a moisturizer for my body, and as a very efficient makeup remover. It&#x27;s always worked really well. I will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for the skin and hair. I just wish this was cheaper.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, and a great price! I use it with essential oils as a massage/body oil and I also use it when making my own body cream. It feels wonderful on the skin!</li>
    <li> have tried a lot of oils this has got to be one of the best all around for your hair and body I&#x27;ve tried, you need to get it, I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for baking, but I just found out it is a moisturizer, anyone has used it for cooking?</li>
    <li> better than baby oil great for winter skin</li>
    <li> Used it as moisturizer did not break my skin out it is by far the best oil moisturizer I have tried and so far I have tried olive oil, jojoba, coconut oils.</li>
    <li> Great astringent! I use grapeseed oil in my OCM mixer, it helps. Also good as a end moisturizer for face and body. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Wow! This Grape Seed Oil is great as a face moisturizer.  I have oily skin and it does not leave my face oily instead it has decreased my oily skin and my face looks refreshed and does not clog pores. Product was recommended to me by my Aesthetician.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
    <li> Highly Recommend this product. Arrived on time and with not issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived Sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend as the product arrived on time</li>
    <li> I use this before applying shaving cream, and it works quite well for that purpose. Reasonably priced, arrived quickly, and works for its purpose. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Grapeseed oil is a lightweight oil that I use as a carrier for many homemade recipes, including with essential oils. I really like the NOW brand and continue to support their company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about grape seed oil so I decided to try this.  It gave me weird little dry patches on my body :(.  NOW makes a sweet almond oil that is great!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it was my first time ever using an oil to seal my hair with. The oil is light, and there is so much of it, i can use it on my skin and hair. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair and skin. I love that it not to greasy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t cook with it, well actually I do.  It makes a great edible massage oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil for essential oils. Also great for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. for months I had been looking for a good oil because I hate lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I normal use organic products by a company called WHIPPED GOODS! I love love love&lt;br /&gt;their products but it can be expensive at times! so I decided to try this and by far was I pleased&lt;br /&gt;I first ordered an 8oz bottle and I loved it so much that I decided to get a 16oz!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love putting on when I get out the shower! it is a great moisturizer especially in this harsh winter!</li>
    <li> I am a black female with natural hair. I use this to oil my scalp to help with itchiness and dandruff. The oil is very light and it makes your hair feel soft and moisturized without being greasy. I would recommend using a color applicator bottle, if you plan on using this oil in the same way that I do. It also arrived quickly from the seller which is something that I appreciate. :)</li>
    <li> This is lovely. Makes your skin soft without making it feel oily. I have terrible eczema that only bothers me in the winter. Will wake up with a scar because i have been scratching all night. This has made it almost a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on when i get out of the shower, then apply a lotion on top. I have tried so many other lotions and creams, and this has been the best for me so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i love the fact that its made from grape seeds. Something about petroleum products that doesn&#x27;t jive well with me.</li>
    <li> As expected. On time. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works really well as a carrier oil.  My children love it an I do as well.</li>
    <li> I use a 30% grapeseed, 50% EVOO, 15% jojoba and 5% tea tree oil mix for the oil cleansing method, and this is a perfect mix for combination / acne prone skin. A very large amount for the money. Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Im using this for a salve. Works great. Showed up on time. Lid was loose when it came but luckily it has a foil seal so it never leaked.</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair which tends to have a dry texture and also as a moisturizer after my shower. The price on Amazon is great as well. And by the way, it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I use grapeseed oil in my body scrubs.Love that it has a plain scent. Cheaper than other brands in the grocery store and came on time. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I love my Now Foods Grape Seed Oil. I have used it for years and it&#x27;s not too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This grapeseed oil has so many uses!! I mix it with my shea and cocoa butters to make my own body lotions, soaps and souffles. I also use it in my hair after washing and it leaves it so soft and shiny!! The price couldn&#x27;t be beat either.</li>
    <li> I use this grapeseed oil as a heat protectant when blowdrying or flat ironing my hair and use it everyday to remove makeup (yes, eye makeup and foundation) as well as my body moisturizer when i step out the shower. it has so many uses and the quality of this one is very nice. if you are into natural products, you need this. everyone should keep some in their bathroom!!</li>
    <li> By far the best Grapeseed Oil product Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It is great for moisturizing skin, especially super, super dry skin. I have rosacea and read somewhere that this combined with castor oil on the face at night, then jojoba oil during the day works great for both redness and dryness. I tried it and it really does work. Though I&#x27;ve tweaked it a bit, still using grape seed oil. My face used to get so dry it would chap and flake no matter what moisturizer I used, and my face would be very irritated and red and itchy. I&#x27;d also get acne like a 14 year old boy going through puberty, all because of my rosacea. I use this now once a day as a moisturizer (and jojoba oil at night since that&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) and my skin has never been so clear and soft! No chapping or crazy redness, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily or greasy (if used sparingly). I swear by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been added to my subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Great massage oil for mixing with essential oils and such.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great for back rubs.</li>
    <li> Love NOW products, and the grape seed oil does not disappoint :)</li>
    <li> I have this, apricot, and jojoba. They are poor quality. I suggest you get pure oils elsewhere. This can also be purchased at GNC or in other stores and sometimes there is a cheap price and sales going. There are organic brands you can purchase on amazon as well. I purchased 1 a while back and it was the best I have ever used. Look through my reviews, I forgot the brand name but my mom purchased these NOW brands via GNC in store and I am not a fan at all!</li>
    <li> Best thing i ever used on my skin that was so cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that some people might be allergic  from someone on youtube . So keep that in mind. I would test it out on my palm first&lt;br /&gt;to see what happens after 24 hours .</li>
    <li> brought this for my daughter who has back ance.  She applies it twice a day.  Amazing product she no longer has ance on her back.  I give this product a &amp;#34;A+&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product for use in cooking, and making homemade bath and beauty products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to cook fish based on other reviews here at Amazon. This is a great oil. It imparts no flavor to the fish and does really well at the heat level needed to cook salmon and tilapia. I plan on trying it with other things and also as a replacement for canola oil in baking recipes.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I use it for my hair and am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Fresh.  What more is there?</li>
    <li> My 4 year old has a bad case of dry skin/eczema (not truly confirmed). She is itchy 5 of the 7 days/nights per week. She is constantly scratching throughout the night. We only use mild cleansers/Cetaphil, etc on her skin and I started using this oil after bathing in conjunction with her Aquaphor application and have noticed that her skin stays moisturized and doesn&#x27;t feel like sand paper to the touch like before without use of the oil.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best all purpose oils on the market....great for cooking or use as body oil. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this grape seed oil to use on my hair and skin. So far I&#x27;ve loved it as a body oil. I will never use lotion again. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy, it goes on lightly (it doesn&#x27;t even look like you have oil on your skin), and it doesn&#x27;t smell oily. As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. I even like it as a moisturizer for my face, although I think it gave me a few break-outs so I won&#x27;t be using it that much on that specific area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I won&#x27;t use this on my hair as I originally intended. I am natural girl with 4b hair. I don&#x27;t know if this will be the same for everyone, but I didn&#x27;t like how this made my hair or scalp feel. My hair felt stiff and it made my scalp itch. I don&#x27;t know why that happened since it didn&#x27;t make the rest of my body itch. I see so many naturals raving about it but it wasn&#x27;t for me. I haven&#x27;t used it as a heat protectant yet, but I probably won&#x27;t put it back in my hair. Better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good oil for skin care. I am little scared to use it as a cooking oil even though it says it&#x27;s food grade.</li>
    <li> awesome for massages and lotion recipes. Grape seed oil is so versatile you can use it for so many different things. I believe this one is food grade too, though I haven&#x27;t tried to use it in any recipes.</li>
    <li> Hexane extracted?! No thank you!! I&#x27;m throwing my nearly full bottle out and just bought one that actually cares about how products are produced and the consumers health.</li>
    <li> I use 1 part of this oil to 2 parts castor oil to cleanse my face...the castor oil I used is also from Now Foods.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I use it for massages, and it goes on well for massage but absorbs into skin well, unlike oils/lotions made specifically for massage. Leaves clients skin looking and feeling much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it leaves a bit of an oily smell in sheets even after they&#x27;ve been cleaned. You&#x27;ll need a good detergent to lessen the after-smell, or to febreeze the sheets before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether a great oil and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it for keeping skin soft right after I shower, and it makes your skin SILKY! Takes a little while to absorb and feels a little sticky until it does, but I just apply it, give it a minute, and towel down my skin to remove any excess. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great oil for my skin.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast, very well packaged. The oil was very good quality. I use this type of oil for the oil cleansing method of cleansing my face and it worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist said these oils are great for dry skin and after one week i have no more itchy shins</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the product ,but I was not pleased with how I received it. I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the seal or  the fact that its oil. I definitely noticed an substantial amount of product seeping through the package. In the future an alternative method should be used to ship any oil or liquid products.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in great condition. Love using this product daily before applying my make-up and at night after taking off my make-up. My skin loves it! Also use on my hands and feet.  Excellent quality from Now Foods.</li>
    <li> Who knew, right? I put a few squirts of it on my puppy&#x27;s food in the morning. She licks it all up in no time! She loves the taste. I have seen a great improvement in her coat, it&#x27;s very silky &amp; soft and promotes a healthy tummy (she has some allergies &amp; this has been great). My friend &amp; her mom both use it for all their dogs as well. All different breeds &amp; ages. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Nice price.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it for moisturizing and it lasts forever.  I never want to run out of this.</li>
    <li> My favorite mixing oil for essential oils. I put this in roller bottles and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my hair and let me tell you, it is great! It is very light and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance like some oils I&#x27;ve purchased. Since most oils are sealants, I also use grape seed oil on my skin after showering. It&#x27;s best to apply when your skin is damp. It keeps my skin soft, supple, and moisturized. It&#x27;s light enough that I even put a little on my face at night. I also like to use this on my hair when its damp. It provides nice shine and moisture.</li>
    <li> good for general use.  I use a lot of oil for different things and these are great. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Love this! Its thin and absorbs very nicely (perfect if you love lotion, but don&#x27;t like having to use so much), so needing less while massaging and the other all skin of all my clients seemed to improve.</li>
    <li> I use this Grape Seed Oil as my facial moisturizer and it is amazing. I have combination skin and this oil caters to both my areas of dry and oily. Its light has basically no odor and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with the Oil Cleansing Method and really like how it feels on my skin. Grapeseed Oil is high in linoleic acid which is important if you have acne prone skin like me.</li>
    <li> I throw a bit of this in when I&#x27;m making smoothies and also use it occasionally as a moisturizer, either alone or mixed with other oils. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works great. I&#x27;ve used it in homemade body butters and soaps. no problems.</li>
    <li> Works great for massages.  Doesn&#x27;t make me feel sticky afterwards.  The bottle gets messy, so try not to store it anywhere you don&#x27;t want stained.  I use a coaster for it.</li>
    <li> I have an auto immune disorder which affects my skin and has been a source of frustration for me to contend with.  For the most part, I make my own skin care products - with a little bit of this and a little bit of that.....adding glycerin and aloe to various oils and this product is a very nice inexpensive oil that does not leave you feeling oily even if used alone.  This is a real find and you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> I would like this better if it didn&#x27;t smell like older oil.  I don&#x27;t know if that is how its supposed smell? That is my only caution.</li>
    <li> Like the Avocado oil....I love this stuff...I use it with my Avocado Oil and it works wonders for my hair....I has really helped my hair and will use it again.....</li>
    <li> I used the item on my natural hair and in my Henna. The smell was great and lift my hair really soft and manageable</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this grape seed oil.  You can cook with it, us it directly on the skin, and use as a base for creams and scrubs depending on what you add it it.</li>
    <li> FYI: Grape seed oil does not smell like grapes! I guess I am new to the &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; world.  I had to use this up faster than all the other oils.  I recommend you get this only if you are planning to use to quickly.  Does not store very well.</li>
    <li> I liked it , very moist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the courier was broken up , its lid open, leaked a lot</li>
    <li> i love grape seed oil for my hair and body it feels amazing</li>
    <li> I now have balanced  soft skin, no more  out of control  oily mess. I use it twice a day. I wish I had found this stuff 40 yrs ago. It would  have saved lost of money. I dont use any of other facial lotions they are gathering  dust.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I put it all over my rosacea breakout-prone skin and it&#x27;s amazing. Can be used for LOTS OF THINGS. :)</li>
    <li> Great product! I love this oil.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product, A++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing this with Sweet Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil &amp; coconut oil for my beard/mustache oils. With some essential oils it works magicly! Not too oily and leaves a nice coat on the hair</li>
    <li> I am using this on my face as a moisturizer, I have very dry  thyroid/menopause issue skin!  It only takes a little and the bottle is big, it has helped some, I use it every other day though, face feels softer and dry patches seem to lessen. May be a little soon to post a review?</li>
    <li> This oil is very good for cooking or for salads.  Has a much lighter taste than olive oil and according to what I&#x27;ve read is better for frying/sauteeing than other oils.  I like that it&#x27;s cold pressed too.</li>
    <li> I use these oils all the time. There are definitely better quality and higher grade oils out there but these work just fine if you&#x27;re not super gung-ho on the whole essential oil thing.</li>
    <li> perfect for after shaving or for mixing your own perfumes with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I try to buy now brand if at all possible as it is a high quality. I make a homemade sugar scrub with this. Grape seed oil helps heal the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews about the benefits of grape seed oil.  I am transitioning to natural hair and I have alopecia areata. I recently started using this oil on a nightly basis combined witha scalp massage. I&#x27;m hoping to stimulate hair growth. I&#x27;ll update this review if I am successful. But I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because it kicked my favorite hair cleanser up several levals. I mixed a small amount of this oil with my Wen SixThirteen as a leave in conditioner and achieved phenomenal results. I let my hair air dry with this concoction and it came out super soft and easy to style. Love this new product. I don&#x27;t think I will ever be with out it.</li>
    <li> pleasant smell good quietly Now products are always worth it at a good price  very happy with all there oils</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast delivery and the price is not bad. I just wanted to know if I could use it instead of cooking oil and did not exactly find the answer.</li>
    <li> Packeged well, not leakage. Added some to my shampoo.</li>
    <li> Most face moisturizers make me break out.  I tried to go the natural route and both coconut oil and olive oil made me break out. Then I read somewhere that different oils work differently for different skin types.  It recommended grapeseed oil since the others made me break out.  This has been amazing.  No more dry flaking skin and no more breakouts.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of grapeseed oil and this is great for the price. It makes my lotions less greasy and keeps the moisturization properties.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! You will love it. I used during my pregnancy and my skin feels great! Also comes sealed nicely. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the oils from this company.</li>
    <li> fast shipping great products will purchase again in the future. i make body lotion for my son this is a must have.</li>
    <li> This a really good oil, I just got it so I can&#x27;t really say much yet. I&#x27;ll have to come back a month later to do a review. But the price is great S&amp;H is great and the bottle is big.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. I use it in my conditioner and body butters. I also put it straight on my face after a glycolic acid treatment.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing. Also this has no smell. Good quality, comes packaged well and is sealed.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time! Not too greasy. Perfect for my dry skin - it&#x27;s now much softer and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Hard to find large sizes in the store.  I use it for my hair.  good value for the size.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> As a natural haired woman, I used this for a long time. A little goes a long way, I even gave most of it to my friend. Not really a scent but its great for moisture.</li>
    <li> AMAZING OIL, GREAT FOR HAIR, SKIN AND NAILS DEFINITELY WISH I ORDERED THE 16OZ..LOVE IT. CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I purchased the Now Grape Seed Oil to help prevent my hair from becoming dry. Somewhere in my use, I discovered that I preferred to use grape seed oil as a moisturizer for my skin. Unlike some of the other oils that you may use on your skin, such as olive oil and castor oil, grape seed oil is not sticky nor is it hard to work with. Depending on the season, I may use it alone or with a lotion that is not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of scents, I personally do not smell anything. This is another reason why I like to use it, because I do not have to worry about the scent mixing with my perfumes or leaving a scent that may be repulsive. I highly recommend this oil if you like to experiment with wholesome products that serve many purposes and are good for you.</li>
    <li> Part of my natural hair night time regimen to keep my scalp healthy. Part of my natural hair night time regimen to keep my scalp healthy.</li>
    <li> This oil is also great to use for skin and hair. just try it you will not be disappointed. its good for under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This oil makes your skin so soft after using it once. I am trying different oils and this one is so far the best. I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I was stuck on Castor Oil &amp; Coconut Oil. Then I bought grapeseed oil and wondered where has it been all my life. I use this on my hair and on my skin. For hair, it&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair. On the flip side, it&#x27;s not light and doesn&#x27;t sit on your hair like coconut oil. My hair actually feels moisturized with grape seed oil.</li>
    <li> like this for making whipped body butter. really hydrates my skin nicely.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it looked and the bottle felt, looked like a glass but was plastic and not that heavy. the only down thing is that I&#x27;m not sure if this product is a cold press or not, and not sure if it can effect the result while using it on skin or not, might be more important for eating I guess. I&#x27;m mixing it with coco butter lotion and vitamin E, sometimes rose hips before use and sometimes alone and so far been happy about it.</li>
    <li> Grape seed oil is almost odorless and has a light non greasy texture. This oil gets easily absorbed by the scalp and hair. I use it for hot oil treatment, scalp massage and to seal my ends.</li>
    <li> I use a very small amount to remove stubborn mascara and eyeshadows with a breeze. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause any breakout.</li>
    <li> We use this for face and body lotion. Both hubby and I. It soaks in fast and does not stay greasy unless you overuse. You can google all the benefits on the Internets.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil a few weeks ago.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would make me break out, since it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  So far, I have not had any break outs.  I put this on before I go to bed, and my skin feels super soft and hydrated in the morning.  The only downside is that my face is shiny after I put it on...which is why I only use it at night.</li>
    <li> I love the product but when I received this it was not packaged well. The box was all wet from the oil leaking out</li>
    <li> I love this oil it is not heavy and mixes well with all my oils.</li>
    <li> Seems to be exactly what was advertised. I left a lower rating before because of packaging in shipment. The product is good, so I want revise it.</li>
    <li> I received the package today and it was leaking. At first I thought maybe an item busted during shipping but that wasn&#x27;t the case. Upon opening the package I saw that the grapeseed oil was leaking and upon closer look, the cap was loose. After removing the cap I find the protection paper pulled back halfway. Someone intentionally opened the bottle and allowed it to leak out. This wasn&#x27;t a shipping error. It was definitely packaging. I purchase from amazon all the time and this by far was the worst packaging!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; how to use essential oils but this feels good on extremely dry, winter skin.  (Yes, I know we are officially in Spring, but tell the weather that)  It feels a little heavier and oilier than I thought it might, but still a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love grape seed oil. I use it for my skin and hair. It&#x27;s not greasy and easily absorbs in the skin/hair.</li>
    <li> This is a lighter oil than almond.  You can still open doors after you put it on hands.  The oil you spill will get gummy over time (outside of the bottle for instance), but it&#x27;ll be 5 months before that happens.  I like adding eucalyptus to it as a hand lotion substitute with some anti-bacterial properties.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue at work to my keyboard either.</li>
    <li> GSO is the best.  Does the job, no flaky skin, nice and smooth and more importantly no obnoxious perfume fumes to deal with.  Also good to put on the ends of your hair before swimming.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing but not greasy. Absorbs very quickly. I like it.</li>
    <li> wonderful&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a deep conditioner for my hair.  I like that the scent and consistency are very light, as compared to olive and coconut oil.  Here&#x27;s how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;-I warm it in a microwave safe bowl&lt;br /&gt;-I comb my hair to remove any tangles&lt;br /&gt;-I apply the warm oil all over my hair and scalp&lt;br /&gt;-I tie up my hair and cover it with a cloth hair cap and let the oil seep into my roots for several hours (ideally 5-6, but sometimes just 3 hours if I&#x27;m busy)&lt;br /&gt;-I wash it our thoroughly with a deep cleaning shampoo like Hair Food by Clairol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it.  My hair feels softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> It appears this oil works pretty well in sealing my hair and not giving the stringy or greasy feel some oils seem to do in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil but I got tired of warming it in my hands when the temperature is below 75 degrees. I needed an all-purpose hair and skin oil that remained liquid at any temperature. Grape seed oil is always liquid. Furthermore, it absorbs very quickly. For my skin I find it is firming and as emollient as a body butter. For my fine hair I find it very light so it seals in moisture without weighing my hair down. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I love this product and all the Now Foods products! They are high quality, cheap and you get a lot for a great price. I use this on my skin and hair and it works great as a light moisture sealant.</li>
    <li> I read about this on a skincare blog and thought I&#x27;d give it ago. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have suddenly developed oily, acne prone skin. When I skip moisturizing my oily skin actually gets worse but I have let to find a moisturizer I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oils are all the rage in skin care but I didn&#x27;t want to pay a million bucks for something that didn&#x27;t work. I also wanted to get something natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but this oil is phenomenal. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all and keeps my skin so hydrated. I only use it at night because being that it is an oil it does give me quite a bit of shine and I can really feel it on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best grapeseed oil I have ever used. It locks in moisture and doesn&#x27;t give you a greasy baby oil feel. If you are looking for a moisturizer that will last all day and does not clog up you skin, Now&#x27;s grapeseed oil is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great in homemade skincare products such as lotions and body butters. No odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for oiling my wooden tunnels and plugs for my stretched ear lobes, as well as lubricating my lobes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a great moisturizer - I use it after I shower and shave (mostly just my lady bits) and my skin is always left silky smooth. I don&#x27;t have problems with irritation from shaving anymore. It does take a little while to soak in, though. Probably could be added to lotion or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally - I actually bought this to be used as a sexual lubricant because I heard that Grape Seed Oil was supposed to be one of the best lubricants. Well, it works amazingly... I will never go back to other lubes. It has virtually no odor or taste, it isn&#x27;t sticky, and provides great lubrication without actually being oily. Natural oils don&#x27;t cause vaginal irritation, either. Plus, unlike other lubes, I am not left feeling like there&#x27;s a gross film leftover down there. Like I mentioned before, a little goes a long way - this bottle is a great deal for what you get out of it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great quality product, and great price!</li>
    <li> Wonderful I use for my hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I love grape seed oil for general skin care use. I have a normal skin type and it keeps my skin moisturizer and supple! I use in conjunction with other essential oils or alone, either way, I love the results. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product arrived packaged properly and ahead of estimated time. I&#x27;ve used it in my Oil Cleansing Method blend and also as a light moisturizer as needed.</li>
    <li> It last long enough in the skin to give a good massage and it comes out easy with warm water after the massage is finished. I will definitely try the others they have!!!</li>
    <li> I like this oil because it isn&#x27;t too heavy and makes for a great light moisturizer for my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for massage purposes.  It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of oily residue on the skin.  I love it! Great price for the amount of oil that you get, too! I&#x27;ll be definitely ordering more and trying more products from this company!</li>
    <li> I use this in hair mixes and as the primary moisturizer for my body after bathing.  I mix it with scented lotions and its perfect.</li>
    <li> I ordered The grape seed oil to use for a variety of reasosns, and I have been able to do that with what was left in my bottle.  When my order arrived, I noticed the outside corner of the package was well.  Since there is currently lots of snow on the ground I just assumed the package had been dropped in the snow and all was fine.  When I got around to getting the package opened, was I in for a suprise.  The bottle of oil had just been dropped in the box with another package.  There was no bubble wrap around the bottle, I would have been happy if they would have at least put a piece of scotch tape on the lid.  Because the other item in the big box was a good size box, my little bottle of oil had been beat up along the road.  The lid to the oil was completely crushed and the safety seal was broken.  What I thought was some snow on the outside of the package was acctually my oil soaking into everything in the package.  I was very releaved to know that the cardboard box would not suffer from dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by this oil. I have read so much about the benefits of Grape Seed Oil for skin, and decided to make a purchase on the same.&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the things I noticed&lt;br /&gt;- the oil is very light, so can be applied in face/body, even for people with oily skin( my skin is oily, and no breakouts using the oil) It makes the skin very soft and give a fresh look on continuous usage&lt;br /&gt;- I combine it in my body creams to make it more moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- It improved my hair texture( I applied the oil before bath, and later removed it using a mild shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;- best thing, the oil is always in liquid form no matter how low the temperature is ( People who experience winter in below 0 temperature, would certainly appreciate this fact)&lt;br /&gt;- the oil is lightly scented, so goes well, when mixed with any fragrance- making a perfect body lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair and body oil mixture, this is a staple oil in my everyday routine.</li>
    <li> This could have been one of my staple oils because it works well in my hair, but I think I may stick to hemp and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> love using this as a carrier or a helping carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Use it for my hair. I am currently growing out my hair and have changed my routine: going completely natural. It is lightweight, leaves my hair soft and super shiny!! Next purchase will be a subscribe and save due to all the other uses and benefits</li>
    <li> This has become my go to for skin and hair lately. I got this at my local neighborhood pharmacy and it has a sweet smell that makes me want to smile just thinking about it. I use it as a moisturizer for my skin and scalp and just like aloe it has skin healing properties that work to reduce the appearance of blemishes and other dark spots and scars in the skin and helps your hair to grow thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s grape seed oil. It works great in my projects.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it for everything skin related. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and seems to lessen the appearance of scars. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very heavy oil. I used it in my hair as part of my natural haircare. It gave such product build up and my hair was stiff in places. I&#x27;ll stick to coconut oil</li>
    <li> I love this light oil for my skin and hair. I apply a few drops just after a shower through wet hair. Tames my wild wavy flyaways and provides a nice, natural shine.</li>
    <li> I use this as a body moisturizer mixed with a little Lavendar essential oil.  Soaks in well, not oily if you don&#x27;t over use it.  A little on your face feels great, too.</li>
    <li> I use this product to blend in with a natural hair &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; that I make. I love that this product is light and doesn&#x27;t smell. It&#x27;s one my staple oils.</li>
    <li> Used this to make body scrubs. Also bought some essential oils from the NOW brand. Mix with some salt and sugar.....bam! you&#x27;ve got an all natural homemade body scrub.</li>
    <li> It is what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might lighter/thinner than other oils, works as a moisturizer, has a water like consistency.</li>
    <li> This has been used as a carrier oil for my essential oils, and it has a very light scent that on its own is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well as just a moisturizer when I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly for removing makeup like mascara and does not leave your face feeling oily afterwards. Wish I had known about it a long time ago; it&#x27;s much better than makeup removers.</li>
    <li> This oil is good for cooking and is especially good to use as a carrier oil for almost any essential oil.  I have been buying NOW products for a long time now and have found them to be very good.  As with all essential oils, I find this one to be very beneficial.</li>
    <li> great for soap making</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use this in conjunction with other products in my natural hair journey.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and as an ingredient in bath melts.</li>
    <li> I think I will always need it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST massage oil on the market</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about grapeseed oil after trying a brand from my local health food store. It was heavy and greasy and made my face break out. I had already ordered the NOW grapeseed oil while using the other one so I was a little skeptic at first. What a big difference! The NOW one is light and it works nicely on my hair and skin. It&#x27;s light and leave my skin silky and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot either. I can&#x27;t wait to try other NOW products</li>
    <li> Helps clear complicated skin gently! Great idea for a gift or personal use! I made small mason jar face scrub gifts for Christmas. This size yielded three.</li>
    <li> Never did I think an OIL could help so much with oily skin! My face has been less oily and more even since I started using grapeseed oil. Old scars are fading, old blemishes are peeling away quickly, and blackheads have disappeared! I use it all over my body as well, scenting it with essential oils for fragrance. It absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> this product is every bit as good as advertised. I was told it may have a bitter flavor but that is not the case. I have used it on three different meals and it leaves things light with no added flavor.</li>
    <li> I use it in my hair so it&#x27;s in a mixture with a lot of other oils so I really can&#x27;t give a huge contribution to the product review but I do feel like it has added a obvious difference to my hair since I have added this oil.</li>
    <li> I load my conditioners up with this oil. It makes my hair super soft and easy to de-tangle. I also use it for hot oil treatments.</li>
    <li> Giant bottle for a great price.  Love this for my face.  The best!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was grape seed oil for cooking.  It is only for the skin.  Beware.</li>
    <li> Good product, it&#x27;s light, no sticky, no smelly. But the label doesn&#x27;t say 100% pure grape seed oil, nor if you can use for cooking. It seems like for external use only.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can say that I &#x27;LOVE&#x27; grapeseed oil, lol, but this is a good buy. Nice quality, useful stuff.</li>
