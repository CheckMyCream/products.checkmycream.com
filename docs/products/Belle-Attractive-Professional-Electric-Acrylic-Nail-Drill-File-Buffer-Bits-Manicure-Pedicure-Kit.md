<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Used once. Second time it broke and  was stuck on high. Don&#x27;t recommend.&lt;br /&gt; The company was great about returning no questions asked</li>
    <li> What a great handy drill, I recently started doing my own nails and this little guy is quite helpful completing the task. The drill is lightweight and I can switch the rotation when switching hands. It comes with drill bits, had two drill holders and a pedal. Perfect for those that manicure themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> A very good quality product. I am glad that I ordered it, and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very very good nail file machine! I was very skeptical at first but when I tested it out I was very pleased with the results. Although the handle does get hot after a long time of use I find it to be a nice machine. It&#x27;s perfect for my customers. Here&#x27;s a pic of my customers nails.</li>
    <li> Oh I do love this product. Very Compact and nicely packaged. I place mine back in the box for storage. Nice weighted drill. I like that you have the option to use a pedal or by the dial. I like the dial so better so far. Good Product.</li>
    <li> Great Machine! Powerful &amp; quiet , includes foot pedal &amp; bits, a desk &amp; side holder for the hand piece.&lt;br /&gt;Looks as good quality as the pro machines!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool! I am very pleased with every aspect it!</li>
    <li> Works great in my home for personal use.... I love it</li>
    <li> I have family members that need help with grooming.  Nails were becoming a problem for me due to arthritis and eye sight.  This is my new best friend.  Easy to use and very reliable.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about nipping someone.  Takes very little time to smooth finger and toe nails and keep them short.  Really a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Very high quality.  Received it really fast.  There&#x27;s a basic manual, only two pages but there isn&#x27;t a clear description of what each bit, attachment is used for so I guess I will just need to experiment with it and search for online videos.</li>
    <li> Really like it at first but now very disappointed with it the hand piece is shorting out!!! It turns off and on while using it have to hold it a certain way to keep it running. Very upset</li>
    <li> We actually have two of these and they work beautifully!  Easy to read instructions - just make sure you read how to insert the filing devices. Easy to use as well!</li>
    <li> Worked a week then nothing</li>
    <li> This by far is the best electric file I have gotten. I am extremely happy with everything about this. Fast shipping, fast file, and really portable.</li>
    <li> I do my own finger nail and my friends. This does a good job. Takes some getting use to but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I specifically bought this for doing my husband&#x27;s toe nails. He has such thick nails that they rub against his shoes and cause holes in his socks. I am impressed with the power this drill. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and I can get the job done in half the time with a battery powered nail drill.</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times now. I like it. Its stable and does the job nicely. Hand-piece gets hot too fast.</li>
    <li> Now I must admit I hesitated when deciding this purchase but I am glad I decided to purchase.  This is a powerful gadget, I mean it really takes the work out of filing just use with caution start on slowest speed until you are more acquainted with unit.  I also really appreciated the email from seller explaining how to use this unit. I would say for those who do acrylic nails make this purchase it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! I was very pleased that unit is quiet and doesn&#x27;t get hot even with continuos use(15-20 min).  Quick change feature is great and variety and quality of bits are sufficient.  Great price too.  Also hand tool is easy to use, foot pedal control speed is set on the device and  either is on at that speed or is off.  Would reccommend!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping works great maybe too great cause even the lowest setting is still a bit fast and burns the nail</li>
