      <li>The most annoying thing was the tiny opening at the top.</li>
      <li>Down side is that it is super runny and can be messy if you are not careful.</li>

    <li> it is liquid which makes me hard to control amount when pouring it out.</li>
    <li> good. a little dry for me.</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations I have ever used , hands down! I am so glad I gave this a chance.. It beats my Makeup For Ever HD, Urban Decay Naked Skin, Tarte, &amp; IT cosmetics foundations no problem. Such a smooth beautiful finish. Lasts all day and most importantly, everthing I put on top of it (blush, highlight, bronzer) lays so well and looks flawless!</li>
    <li> color deeper than my skin</li>
    <li> Its a pretty good drug store product. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel dry or oily. It is a very light coverage so I like it because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It is hard to find my color so I have to mix 2 colors together to match my skin tone.</li>
    <li> very little coverage. I felt my skin was greasy to the touch and felt heavy. The most annoying thing was the tiny opening at the top. It was so difficult to get enough without pouring too much out.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation, it goes on smooth, the coverage is good. I ordered a few colors as its hard to order online and get the right color.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer before or I can, either way its goes on smooth. I highly recommend trying. It spreads good, something is really nice about this perfecting makeup, experimenting with the right color</li>
    <li> It is amazing! Its so easy! Its just like putiing a powder on your face! But it actually hiding all the impurities and discoloration! Its not sticky at all! Absolutely a natural feeling!</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations (liquid or not) I have ever worn and at this price, exceedingly good value. I wanted to try this as it is the only product that has scored a 5-star review on L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s own website and I was not disappointed. It is a powdery finish, as described. Light coverage but good enough to cover most blemishes and it really does look like that you&#x27;re not wearing foundation. I will be buying more bottles of this!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Of course, it is discontinued!  Try this as a replacement; L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Super Blendable Makeup, Creamy Natural, 1.0 Ounces.  It is about $6.00 on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Looks natural but has a drying effect on skin. I use  Two Faced poreless primer first (love that stuff) and my skin looks great all day. Love that the make-up has Sun screen in it.</li>
    <li> Light coverage, great use for summer! Liquid and dries matte. Very soft feel on your skin! Down side is that it is super runny and can be messy if you are not careful. Very good product overall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to pick out the right color over the web, but I (foolishly) gave it a try.  Despite the fact that it&#x27;s not quite my color, I like it and I just bought a second bottle in a shade that&#x27;s too light.  I mix the two together and that fixes the color issue.  I like the consistency and coverage.  It&#x27;s definitely on the lighter end of the coverage spectrum, so if you&#x27;re trying to cover a lot of imperfections, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  It does a good job evening out skin and covering minor imperfections.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product evens out my skin tone and it doesnt even look like i am wearing makeup. Only downside is that it doesnt have much coverage at all</li>
    <li> safe some bucks go buy melbellene wayyyy better, i returned it. the liquid is way tooooo light like water. dont cover your dark spot or anything at all. dissappointed.</li>
    <li> i really like this one. It doesn&#x27;t have a 100% coverage but it evens my skin tone very well. It&#x27;s very smooth and i don&#x27;t feel it heavy at all. very natural. great for daily use.</li>
    <li> Looks great, covers flaws, and is lightweight! Couldn&#x27;t really ask for more.</li>
    <li> This really does hides my blemished and dark circles!! I really love this product. Would buy again and would recommend to friends to buy this product. It is worth the money!!</li>
    <li> B careful with this foundation, after you put it on in an hour or two it sets into fine lines and causing a whole different problem.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my face! So soft and smooth you can hardly tell it is on.</li>
