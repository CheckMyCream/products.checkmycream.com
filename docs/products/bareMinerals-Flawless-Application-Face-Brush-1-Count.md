      <li>Okay-</li>
      <li>i love the look and size</li>
      <li>I love the makeup but won&#x27;t be using their brushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will work wonders with powder foundation once I try it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this brush, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a blush brush rather than a foundation brush.</li>
      <li>I have had 3 already and do not plan on purchasing any more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>But more bristles come out of this one</li>

      <li>I love it and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more with the way it applies the foundation.</li>
      <li>one of my favorite brushes.</li>

      <li>It was definitely worth the price!!</li>
      <li>The flawless brush application is feather light and provides solid coverage.</li>
      <li>But ultimately this is the best brush for mineral powder when you want light to medium coverage.</li>
      <li>Great brush, very soft bristles.  </li>
      <li>Picks up my loose powder perfectly.</li>
      <li>This brush makes for a perfect application of the loose pigment.  </li>
      <li>It helps the powder go on more smoothly.</li>
      <li>This brush works very well and seems to be of good quality.</li>
      <li>I have bought four or five other brushes since I started using the mineral make up &amp; this one is the best!  </li>
      <li>This brush is more synthetic and does not hold its shape when applied to face (like the original brush).</li>
      <li>It might be good as a blush or warmth adding brush, but not as your main powder foundation brush.</li>
      <li>Great brush, always been a fan of bare minerals!</li>
      <li>Great for Bare Minerals Makeup.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t last long at all.  The bristles fell out on my face and it had a slight odor.  Not like the ones I buy in the store.</li>
    <li> Applying my makeup with this brush makes it looks very professional. It does not shed like the other brushes I have had.</li>
    <li> I already own a mineral brush (Lancome...highly recommended) when I got this brush, but it came with the Bare Escentuals starter pack that I bought at the mall. With that being said, I haven&#x27;t used the bare escentuals brush all that often (never two days in a row) since I love my Lancome brush so much. Two days ago I used my Bare Escentuals brush two days in a row.  I broke out all over my face. It kept getting progressively worse over the course of the two days.  My skin felt hot to the touch and it felt like I had a bad sunburn. I thought back to what I had done differently in my routine and the only thing I kept coming back to was the brush. First off, it feels VERY rough on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure what everyone is talking about when they say it&#x27;s the softest brush they have ever used. It feels terrible; very uncomfortable. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my sensitive skin. I have never had a problem in all of my 18 years of using make-up brushes, though.  So after some research on the internet, I found out that the brush is made of goat hair. I have terrible allergies, especially to animal hair. So... if you have allergies/sensitivities to animal hair/fur, do not use this brush. I just wish I would have known that before I used the brush.</li>
    <li> I just received this blush brush. Its really soft on the skin so its perfect for powder which is what I&#x27;ll be using it for. Very excited that they threw in a free Kabuki brush as well!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to apply the bare minerals foundation. It&#x27;s a soft brush, so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my face.. and it applies the foundation really well. I love it and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more with the way it applies the foundation. The only problem that bothers me is that it comes with no case.. so I&#x27;m always worried that the hairs will split apart and it wont last for a long time. Other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I really like the brush. For some reason they sent me the green one instead of black but still the same thing. At first a lot of the bristles fell out but I kept using it and it is completely satisfying to use with any powder makeup.</li>
    <li> Okay- it does the job however am not happy with all the hair fallout I get on my face during powder application.  Other than that, decent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> best brush ever, flawless application. Works well with any mineral powder.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great brush for applying mineral makeup. I have Bare Minerals, and it works great for putting it on my face. I have used other kabuki brushes, and it seems as though this one is more precise and doesn&#x27;t put too much makeup in one place like some of the other brushes seemed to. Other people have mentioned in reviews that this brush loses bristles...of course it does, it&#x27;s a brush! However, I only notice a bristle or two coming out once in a while, it&#x27;s not a huge problem.     I would recommend this brush, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> ok the reson is that when i first used this brush some of the fibers were all of my face i love the look and size but why are the fibers coming loose</li>
    <li> Perfect brush to apply powder or concealer.</li>
    <li> The skin on my face has been hurting. I thought I had too much sun, or using the wrong new SPF lotion. After reading these reviews, I realize the brush from BARE ESCENTUALS is the culprit. My skin feels raw and it hurts when I wash it.  I am very disappointed with the quality of the brush.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to use. It is just as described and perfect for applying powder (not just bare escentuals brand)</li>
    <li> I love the size of this brush and the way it feels when I&#x27;m applying my make-up.   It&#x27;s so soft and spreads my mineral make-up perfectly!  It was definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Picks up my loose powder perfectly.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews about this brush losing strands, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it.  I keep it in a separate brush container, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  It is very soft and applies my pressed powder very evenly.  I never worry about missing a spot.</li>
    <li> great brush for the money. I would recommend this site&lt;br /&gt;real thing ! too bad i already had the exact same brush. but they do last years if you wash it right</li>
    <li> I bought this and it came thin, rough, and shedding. I hate the roughness when I use it and it doesn&#x27;t apply the powder foundation well it flings the power around. I would not buy this again and I wish I could return it but it is opened. It now sits in a junk drawer in my house.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It works perfectly for my bareminerals powder.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of brushes as a backup for when I clean the first set I got (handi buki, flawless face and full coverage face). These brushes were not the same as the ones I purchased from the Bare Escentuals section at Ulta the week before. The handi buki is smaller, hard and the bristles do shed like made. The other two brushes are also harder and shed a lot in comparison to the brushed purchased in store. None of them apply the product as well as the good ones. It did not apply the foundation nearly as well as the original. It is horrible. I will go to Ulta and purchase a new proper set so I wasted my money here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name printed on the side of these brushes is id Bare Escentuals. The GOOD brushes bought in store do not have the \\&quot;id\\&quot; on them. This makes me wonder if these brushes are not genuine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI the real BE brushes available at Ulta are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great easy to apply!!!</li>
    <li> The brush is OK. It is soft and applies makeup smoothly.</li>
    <li> I already had a brush I had gotten a couple of years ago and I was getting this one for my daughter.  I was a little disappointed in the brush.  The bristles were not quite as firm.</li>
    <li> This brush is not the same as the  Bare Escentuals Flawless Application brush that comes with the Bare Escentuals Starter Kit.  This brush is more synthetic and does not hold its shape when applied to face (like the original brush).</li>
    <li> Before buying this I purchased the same one in the store. It was a great brush and I was sad when I lost it. It was so expensive in the store and cheaper on amazon. But the one I purchased from amazon is nothing like the one from the store. It fell apart so easily and was very hard on my skin.</li>
    <li> A good price for a nice brush.  It helps the powder go on more smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush for blush! I have many many brushes and I love this one the most for blush!!! It does shed a bit but what brush doesn&#x27;t?? It is wonderful for the price!  [...]</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my mineral powder.  The coverage is horrible and I found myself having to reapply my powder every few hours, when with other brushes it would last all day with only one application.  I don&#x27;t know how just changing the brush would have that big of an effect, but I changed back to my old brush and haven&#x27;t had the same problem.  It might be good as a blush or warmth adding brush, but not as your main powder foundation brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this brush. I bought it when I bought the Bare Minerals foundation because I thought it would be higher quality than my regular one (from Albertson&#x27;s!)... But more bristles come out of this one and I have to sit and pick them off of my face and my clothes. I don&#x27;t think it does a good job of applying the powder either. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have bought four or five other brushes since I started using the mineral make up &amp; this one is the best!  It is soft &amp; not scratchy on my face.</li>
    <li> This brush works okay, but it is starting to shed so much that I am questioning the quality. Probably should have just bought the rea deal at Sephora or something. Can&#x27;t really say this brush is any better than something you&#x27;d get at the drug store.</li>
    <li> The bristles shed like crazy.  I have had to pick bits of brush off my face with tweezers.  I threw this out after a few uses as it was very poorly made and quite annoying.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  This is my third one.  They last for months.  I use it everyday with the bare minerals powder.</li>
    <li> A first class product with a first class price because of its high quality for ease of use when utilizing powder foundation!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my fault but I didn&#x27;t realise it&#x27;s a really small brush, and not the full sized one I currently use.</li>
    <li> I have never found a make up brush that I like as well as this one!  The bristles are real, no synthetic. This brush helps the make up to go on smoothly. Only brush I use!</li>
    <li> I do like this brush, a lot.  It works great with the BM line, and gives the coverage it promises.  My only complaint is that it seems to shed a bit.  Which means I&#x27;ll have to replace it sooner rather than later.  But it&#x27;s a great product and delivers what is promised.  Shipped fast, arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Not &#x27;as&#x27; soft as I remember them to be, but for the price here and probably the fact that mass production of this product means reshaving the sable hair off of the same animal multiple times, results in slightly coarser ends, making it feel a little prickly on the skin. It still gets the job done though :)</li>
    <li> I think this is a knock off, just my opinion... Bristles were rough and handle fell apart, I&#x27;m a huge fan of bare escentuals brushes, this doesn&#x27;t seem authentic</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Bought as replacement for prior well worn one.</li>
    <li> I GOT A FAKE BRUSH! and just to prove it I purchased one at the bare minerals store for $15 to compare and I was right! Boooo!</li>
    <li> This product is not the same quality as previous brushes I have purchased with other products from Bare Minerals.  Brush sheds badly.</li>
    <li> I got this brush as a replacement for the original that came in my starter kit.  I like the shape but the bristles have changed a little and don&#x27;t seem as high quality as before.</li>
    <li> This brush works very well and seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> This was much less dense than I was expecting.  It&#x27;s more of a blush brush rather than a foundation brush.</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSHES, AND CHEAPER THAN BUYING HERE AT HOME.</li>
    <li> I purchased the bare escentuals mineral foundation and LOVE it! Naturally, I thought I would get the brush designed for the product, and was really disappointed. The bristles are loose and somewhat coarse. I figured the bristles would be super luxurious and soft, and that it would be a tighter grouping, so as to apply the product a little heavier. Returning this item.</li>
    <li> Awesome as usual. No complaints with this brush.</li>
    <li> I give it no stars wasnt what I ordered will not order again very disappointed wasn&#x27;t wirth the hassel of sending back</li>
    <li> I love bareMinerals and their makeup has changed my life, but this brush, made me change my clothes after using it! There were bristles ALL over me and my shirt. I had to bend over to apply the wonderful foundation in the hopes of it not shedding all over my chest and shirt. I do not recommend this brush, however, the foundation and makeup are marvelous!</li>
    <li> This brush does a good job at distributing the makeup evenly, though it is not as soft as I thought it wold be.</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money - I&#x27;ve had it a week and the bristles are falling out all over the place.  I thought maybe it would get better after a few days, but no luck.  I don&#x27;t know - perhaps this is not the real thing because the first Bare Minerals brush I owned (that I replaced with this one) was fine for almost a year before it started shedding.</li>
    <li> Great for Bare Minerals Makeup.  I lost my original brush and decided to get a cheaper brush from the drug store.  Other reviews say that this brush sheds, every brush I tried sheds more then this.  This also seems to work better with the bare minerals makeup then the other brushes I tried.  I really like this brush and for the price, you cant beat it!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good for blush or bronzor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Scratchy&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t retain shape after washing&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t deposit enough foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came in the starter kit I got as a gift and it sucks. I only use it for blush, which it actually distributes well. It distributes the power foundation terribly. The only reason why it got a 2 is because it actually got softer after I washed it so it wasn&#x27;t nearly as scratchy, but it did lose some of its shape: it became more fanned out and less dense.</li>
    <li> Consider purchasing another brush since these do not hold up well. I have had 3 already and do not plan on purchasing any more. They are nice for about 2 weeks then become extremely stiff, scratchy, and matted. They also shed REALLY bad whenever I use it. I have tried to clean them using traditional brush cleaners and even condition them with olive oil for softness and nothing seems to help them. I cringe when I use this brush in the morning since it is so scratchy. I love Bare Escentuals products but this one falls very short. I&#x27;ve contacted the company about the recurring issues with the brushes I&#x27;ve had. I was told that it is because of the goat&#x27;s hair they use to pack the brush that it needs to be treated and cleaned differently than other brushes and that I needed to purchase a specific BE cleaner for this brush. They also said the shedding was normal. I love the makeup but won&#x27;t be using their brushes. NOT RECOMMENDED. Find something of better quality.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my old warn out one, they last a really long time if you wash it frequently with gentle soap and water, so it&#x27;s worth spending the extra money.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace my original brush and the price was right.</li>
    <li> its a great brush I use mine for the bare minerals warmth or bronzeing powder deffinitly one of my favorite brushes.</li>
    <li> All the bristles fall out all over the place from the moment I bought it. REALLY annoying! I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this. It&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush. Does NOT cover everything. It&#x27;s good for medium to light coverage. Switch to E.L.F brush people, it&#x27;s much better! Trust me.</li>
    <li> Great brush, a little bigger than I anticipated (though I am not really up to date on makeup tools these days) but it ended up applying foundation even better than the smaller brush I had been using.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush.  I have several and use them mostly for blush.  They have natural bristles and pick up just the right amount of product.  I am a fan of Bare Minerals blush and have 5 or 6.  This brush makes for a perfect application of the loose pigment.  They clean up easily with soap and water and (dried flat) always keep their shape.  I&#x27;m sure this brush would work equally well for Bare Minerals foundation (which I don&#x27;t use).  They would be suitable for loose powder as well.  All in all, a very nice brush for a very nice price.</li>
    <li> Totally not worth it. The brush sheds and its just overall feels  like a ripe off .Please do not purchase this brush .It really sucks!</li>
    <li> not as good as earlier brush</li>
    <li> I love the brush to use with my bare escentuals makeup. it&#x27;s perfect and the application of the product is awesome</li>
    <li> Was sent the wrong brush (I was sent the kabuki brush).  Even though I was sent the wrong item, the kabuki brush that was sent seems fake and not quality of the real Bare Escentuals.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Just go to the store and spend more money to get the real thing.  Probably won&#x27;t bother returning, but will not order these brushes from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> This brush is great as it does not allow for heavy build up. The flawless brush application is feather light and provides solid coverage. I highly recommend this application face brush!</li>
    <li> Loved this brush!  Bare Minerals brushes are unqiue and some of the best on the market!  A must-buy if you&#x27;re using any Bare Minerals foundation!</li>
    <li> Have been using Bare Minerals and Bare Escentuals brushes for years..these brushes are the best bar none.</li>
    <li> I love this product because the brush bristles are nice and face and applies the makeup evenly. I like it even more knowing I paid a great price and got it shipped straight to my door.</li>
    <li> The hair falls out of this brush and you have to pick it off your make up. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush since 2003.  It&#x27;s now December of 2012.  I washed and cared for this brush carefully over the years.  Until yesterday, a simple wash in soapy water would make the brush come back to its original condition.  Now, I see that the bristles are taking on some wear and tear.  Not only that, and this is all about me, sometimes, I have not cooled down enough from my workout and shower and when I apply the foundation, it seriously clumps to the bristles.  Sigh.  I had to get out a stronger grease cutting detergent for that.  So, now I am back in the market for this brush-ok, it should have been replace a year ago.  I do have one brush on hand from another kit that I purchased, I just hate to break up the kit!  Overall, the brushes that I have from Bare Escentuals have had a long and productive life with me.  The other brush that I&#x27;ve had since 2003, the double end eye-shadow / eyeliner brush is getting to the replacement point as well.  Overall, it&#x27;s best not to over load the brush OR your face with too much powder--if you want to look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that there are complaints here and the the BE site on how this brush sheds.  Honestly, they must have done something as a cheaper solution in the past few years, or reviewers are really using this brush harshly.  I&#x27;d bet on the former though, and having said that, if one is not happy with their brush, they should not only post, but call BE and talk with customer service.</li>
    <li> I love how this brush applys the makeup.  All the other mineral type foundations I have found, the brushes tend to get brittle.  This is so feather light when I use it.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes, but only the best will do.  This one does exactly what i want it to do and in style.  It&#x27;s made very well and holds up to my &amp;#34;abuse&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering the Bare Minerals brushes at such a low price...but it&#x27;s the real deal!  And a great one at that!!!</li>
    <li> This brush sheds a lot. It gives good application and coverage, but I&#x27;m sick of picking little hairs off my face.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and I am very pleased with the quality of the brush, it almost feels like I am applying brand new powder.</li>
    <li> I love all of their products! and this brush applies powders effortlessly. I recommend their products to everyone; if you&#x27;re looking for a quality brush at a reasonable cost, this is the one to purchase.</li>
    <li> You can spend a lot of money on items like this.  This works well, and well worth the money.  This appears to be exactly the same as the high priced brush than my wife is replacing.</li>
    <li> I had loss my other bare minerals brush that I love a lot. So I when ahead and purchase this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. I have had it for about 1 year now and haven&#x27;t had a problem. The brittles are still in there and it pretty much like it came out of the package yesterday.</li>
    <li> great brush! soft and perfect. they price is good too they are usually more expensive anywhere else. a a a</li>
    <li> Very large bristled brush. It looked very small but it&#x27;s huge.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite bare essentials brush.  The bristles seem to fall out quite easily and it works better for just blush rather than using it with the bare minerals foundation</li>
    <li> This brush does a good job, I just watch for sales, as it can be expensive.  I recommend washing brush in warm, not hot water and place on clean tissue to dry. I usually have a separate brush for each blush, so colors don&#x27;t mix.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it.  I&#x27;m sure it will work wonders with powder foundation once I try it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush...received order super fast and I can&#x27;t wait to use it. This brand of brushes has been the best quality of the many brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Works find and seems to be the same as ones sold at BE Boutiques. Pretty satisfied with the product overall. Very light and airy on your face.</li>
    <li> Great for Bare Minerals powder.  Love the size and the softness of the bristles.  Would recommend to anyone that ask.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I had a brush exactly like this one and used it for a long time.  It was getting thread-bare, or should I say hair-bare, so I wanted to get one exactly like it.  When I saw this one, I ordered it immediately and I love it.  Best brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I use this brush all the time. Don&#x27;t forget to buy the cleaning solution. I clean my brushes once a month to keep them clean and in good shape. If you do not clean them the bristles fall out.</li>
    <li> I needed a new brush. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Have already used product in the past and really liked this brush for applying a variety of are Minerals products.Arrived in sealed package. Much softer and fluffier than my current brush. Good prices and Fairly quick shipping.</li>
    <li> It was a great brush! I hope to buy more brushes from you in the future. Thanks so much! :)</li>
    <li> I use this for my bare minerals blush brush.  It&#x27;s soft and offers complete coverage where I want and need it!</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for years.  Every time I think &amp;#34;oh, I&#x27;ll just buy one at the convenience store&amp;#34; I totally regret it.  These do not shed their bristles, they are soft on your face, last a long time, and cover evenly.  The hydrating application brush is amazing if you have drier skin!!</li>
    <li> Great brush, always been a fan of bare minerals!</li>
    <li> love the feel of this brush.  Great for applying my bare minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing bare minerals for years and love it! I lost one of the brushes in the kit so I ordered this one. This is the same one that comes in the starter kit! What a relief, the brushes cost a fortune in the store.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my product because I really like this brush and feel that is is over priced in store. So I was glad to get a good deal on it.</li>
    <li> i love bare mineral products, i needed a new brush and this was the best deal. i love it lots</li>
    <li> i love love love this brush, my makeup goes on soooo much better. i use bare minerals an also mary kay mineral power and it goes on so good with this brush...</li>
    <li> The quality of the brush is nice, but it is flat and smaller than I expected. It seems to apply my powder make up just fine so it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my older bare minerals brush that had seen better days after 5 years. I learned that its important to wash your makeup brushes with a brush soap at a minimum of once a month. I didn&#x27;t know this so my brush didn&#x27;t last as long as it could have. But ultimately this is the best brush for mineral powder when you want light to medium coverage.</li>
    <li> I bought my brush at the store and it is shedding and feels rough on my skin. Not to mention breaking out!  Trashing it when I get home!</li>
    <li> My  daughter (who is 24 and very knowledgeable about makeup and skin products) purchased a brush (she was excited about the cost) and it immediately made her face break out in a rash.  The brush is poor quality and is not soft but brittle.  There is something wrong with this product.  I do not believe it is genuine and could be a knock off.  Anyone who knows anything about the quality of a good brush will tell you these are bad.  I would never recommend wasting your money on this product as we did.  I wish I would have seen Jamie&#x27;s review before my daughter purchased this awful product.  (As a note we were contacted by the seller to send it back but we already paid $5 for shipping and they will not reimburse for the shipping.  And when you factor in the fact that you have to pay to ship it back also - well you certainly have a lot more invested than you want to in a 50 cent makeup brush.)  It deserves MINUS stars. I had to mark it a one or else review would not go through.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the brush because it is so hard on my face. When I use it, it leaves left over furs on my face. I don&#x27;t like that. Not a good brush for face maybe for something else.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Love this product</li>
    <li> Great brush, very soft bristles.  I had one of these brushes that lasted for years!  Bare minerals products are the best.</li>
