<li> Seems it&#x27;s being discontinued, as far as I can see, because it&#x27;s not available anywhere.</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed as I suspect it may have been discontinued as supply is very limited and my initial purchase was a set with the lotion that was made in a discount store.  </li>
<li> You will not be sorry .</li>
<li> Skeptical at 1st, but I like to keep this at my kitchen &amp; bath sink areas!</li>
<li> Smells are subjective, so perhaps buying scented things on amazon was a bad idea...</li>

    <li> I received this as a gift set, with the lotion, and fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s a lovely scent.  Also looks very nice in my bathroom. So, I ordered what I could on line.  Seems it&#x27;s being discontinued, as far as I can see, because it&#x27;s not available anywhere.</li>

    <li> Good quality - just as expected.  My favorite fragrance.  Wish the company still made it.  Not much left on Amazon.</li>
