<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It is a heavy blow dryer.</li>
    <li> For the price you pay its really great quality. Dries my hair really fast and feels like high quality. I can&#x27;t imagine paying more than 50 dollars for a hair dryer and this is priced right. The extra items included are great, really like the round brush.</li>
    <li> Definitely dries hair quicker than other blow dryers but not powerful enough to do a blowout on my tight curly hair. Cannot straighten tight curly hair. Kind of disappointed because bought this product specifically for blowouts. This is intended for hair that is naturally straight/fine.</li>
    <li> I selected my last hair dryer for three qualities: light in the hand, quiet, and attractiveness.  This dryer surprised me by being just as quiet and just as light as my previous dryer.  And I guess &amp;#34;attractive&amp;#34; is in the eye of the beholder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with rather extensive accessories: 3 plastic sectioning clips, 3 &amp;#34;hook and loop&amp;#34; style rollers, and a really large round brush.  I have chin-length, fine, straight hair, and found the rollers too large to get purchase in my hair.  The clips work fine, although I don&#x27;t really need to section since there isn&#x27;t much bulk.  I really like the big round brush, though.  It is lightweight and has relatively large single stem plastic bristles as opposed to the usual round brushes that seem to be a very bristly brush with some sort of hole-y metal cylinder slid over them.  This brush doesn&#x27;t scratch your cheeks as you roll it, or stick into your scalp.  There is also a concentrator that slides onto the end of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer, itself, is very usual in terms of operation.  There are two 3-position rocker switches for temperature and speed.  One complaint I have is that it is very easy to accidentally &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; the rocker switches on the handle while holding the dryer; slider switches that move up and down resist that a lot better.  There is a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button that works just fine.  The high power is quite powerful and the medium nicely controlled.  The heated setting is quite hot but not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord has a nice loop for hanging right where it comes out of the dryer handle, and the cord keeper &amp;#34;cable tie&amp;#34; is re-usable rather than a black twist-tie.  I&#x27;d prefer a retractable cord, but this one is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing left is to discuss the color, and there I just have to say &amp;#34;Conair, what were you thinking?&amp;#34;  It really is pretty ugly and not something that will go with most bathroom decor unless perhaps your bathroom is a tribute to the Minneosta Vikings.  The yellow is very BRIGHT, something even my colorblind husband was able to discern.  You will not misplace this dryer in a steamy bathroom, that&#x27;s for sure!throom is a tribute to the Minneosta Vikings.  The yellow is very BRIGHT, something even my colorblind husband was able to discern.  You will not misplace this dryer in a steamy bathroom, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> I currently own another blow dryer, a different brand, also rated at 1875 watts.  This one is slightly quieter and smaller, but weighs about the same.  It takes longer to dry my hair with this dryer than the other one. Though this generates ample air flow and heat, the nozzle is significantly smaller than the other dryer.  I believe that&#x27;s why it takes longer to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a functional concentrator that is easy to attach and remove.  It does not, however, come with a diffuser, which means it will be of little use to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three velcro rollers and clips are included.  The rollers are large in diameter, but short in width.  I could not get all of my hair, which brushes my shoulders, wrapped around them.  I could have, if they were wider.  Because the rollers are so large in diameter, they can&#x27;t be used at all unless one&#x27;s hair falls well below the chin.  Furthermore, velcro is meant to attach objects.  Those little tiny fish hooks grabbed onto my hair, and I had an awful time removing the rollers.  By the time I managed it, the curl I&#x27;d achieved was beyond repair.  I don&#x27;t recommend velcro in your hair.  It can cause damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included is a round, plastic, extruded brush with a metal barrel.  Though mine arrived with a number of the bristles bent, I can still get it through my hair.  I found the brush very useful, and if I found it sold separately, I would buy it.  The bristles do not have those little knobs on them.  I like that, because those little knobs can catch hair.  The ends of the bristles are not perfectly smooth, and can scratch the scalp.  I found that holding the brush just a hair away from the scalp, I can get some volume.  No curl, but my hair is straight and fine.  For longer hair, this is a very good blow styling brush.  It is not appropriate for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this blow dryer is quite adequate if you don&#x27;t need a diffuser and don&#x27;t plan to use the rollers, but it is not spectacular.ular.</li>
    <li> First, this is a very lively-looking hair-dryer. It is a good dryer, does a good job. Buttons are placed in the right place, the unit can be cleaned fairly easy - as it has become standard for the rear grill to come off. I&#x27;ve talked to 3 Salon stylists over the last month in reference to this unit and they definitely have a different view of &amp;#34;Pro Salon&amp;#34; Hair dryers. Those hair dryers are actually not available to the general public, as they are can easily overheat the hair of unexperienced people. Unlike this hair dryer that has 1875 Watts, the professional ones can have 3200 Watts, and therefore, a lot more power.</li>
    <li> This comes with a decent quality brush, and it dries hair quickly.  It is light, sleek and seems to do the job faster than my other blow dryer.  I did not notice a difference in the quality of the heat from my other dryers. Unlike other reviewers, I actually kind of like the color.  It makes it easy to find if you have a lot of other appliances, but beware - it is bright.</li>
    <li> In a household with three women, we have used a wide range of hair dryers in the price range of $19.99 through $150.  All my girls were surprised by the power as was I.  I was especially surpised by the build quality, not expecting it in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is packaged very well and not difficult to remove.  The Infiniti does not come with a diffuser.  It arrives with a concentrator, some hair clips, a pretty decent quality brush, and some inexpensive rollers you will likely not use.  The concentrator is easy to put on and remove. The design of the Infiniti is pretty good.  All the girls found it easy to hold and use though the rocker switch was depressed accidentally a number of times until they got used to it.  There is a loop at the handle base to hang the Infinit when not in use, a nice feature.  Infiniti provides two speed settings, three heat settings, and a very quick cold shot.  The build quality feels solid, not cheap in any way, which makes it a little on heavy side for our seven year old to use by herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit operates flawlessley at 1875 watts.  However, it is not too loud even when compared to the Elchim at more than double the price (2000 watt however) and slightly less airflow in my opinion when compared side by side. Our girls have a combination of short curly hair and long straight hair.  This dryer blew the curly hair straight in no time and reduced friss significantly (eliminated it with our daughter who has natural straight hair).  In my opinion, the ionic claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it is a great hair dryer in this price range, if not among the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hairdryer . . . in a color that hurts the eyes . . . with rollers and sectioning clips that do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What dries my hair faster is the attachment, which comes with many other brands of hairdryers, just not in purple. I have another 1875 Watt hairdryer that has a less tapered front end, so this one is a tad more forceful. The included brush works as well as any other round brush I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two speed settings and three heat settings, and the cold shot is quick - I&#x27;ll give it that much. No waiting for the cold air to come. It&#x27;s hard to use, though, because it&#x27;s a big hairdryer and pulling the trigger with my hand that far away from my head at that angle is awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is smooth afterwards, just as smooth as it is after using my other two ceramic hair dryers. It seems ceramic is all we can get nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good hairdryer as far as hairdryers go, just overhyped and hurts the eyes.</li>
    <li> I always feel bad ruining a product&#x27;s average if mine has a defect.  I may be the only one... but I will be up front.  After several weeks of use, the fan is contacting something in the housing making a very loud noise and I now cannot use the product.  Until then, this was a superb product.  Assuming that this is a fluke, I would highly rate this.  You will have to read other reviews to see if it is a fluke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise,&lt;br /&gt;The controls are easy to use.  I like the options.  The fan is strong.  The lint screen is easy to remove and clean.  The dryer is comfortable to hold.  The color is a bit obnoxious but that is a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels like a professional product..  I hope I am the only one with the defect.  If the manufacturer is reading this, I&#x27;d appreciate a replacement but it is too much hassle for me to pack this up on my own and send it back.m</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro by Conair Limited Edition Blow-Out Hair Dryer aims to be competitively priced while delivering better than budget dryer performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, those who used the dryer in my family loved the colors.  The bright yellow and purple are sure liven your spirits as you work on your hair.  Like many dryers today, ceramic technology and ionic technology are included which according to the manufacturer, &amp;#34;promotes healthy looking hair,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;reduces frizz.&amp;#34;  There is also a removable filter on the back end of the dryer.  Be sure to keep it clean of lint buildup for the optimum performance and life of your dryer.  In this special set, a round brush, three velcro rollers, and three sectioning clips are also included!  My family stated these were not of the best quality, but they enjoyed these bonuses nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drying time impressed my family, and they stated it was fun to use as you knew it was performing so well indeed.  While they currently used a much more expensive dryer, they actually found the performance equal with this Infiniti Pro.  The noticeable differences was this product &amp;#34;felt,&amp;#34; a bit cheaper and was slightly heavier.  However, for the price, everyone found this product to be a no brainer.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as a dryer that costs several times the price of this one, the cost makes it reasonable to replace should it be needed.  Furthermore, if one of your bathrooms is missing a hair dryer, it&#x27;s a great price point to fill that void.  Overall, this Infiniti Pro is packing a lot of features and even some bonus accessories into a nice price point.  You have a slightly cheaper build quality on this product versus a higher end model, but yet you are getting better quality and performance than an entry level product too.  It&#x27;s right in the sweet spot.  Recommended product.</li>
    <li> This was immediately heavier than my other Conair hair dryer even when I lifted the package.  I thought oh no, this is way too heavy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost put off trying this out due to the extra heft this has over my other beloved Conair dryer.  But I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gave me the best at home blow-out I&#x27;ve ever had.  It dried my hair super fast without having to bake it.  I have frizzy wavy hair but all frizz is gone even without conditioner after using this.  It is silky straight and dried in incredibly fast time, without feeling like it was beating and heating my hair to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so straight after a quick dry with this, it almost looks like I ironed it.  And I didn&#x27;t even condition it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked on this heavy dryer.  It dries so fast and so well, I don&#x27;t have time to get tired of holding it.  I never knew the right dryer could make such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with three huge rollers, three matching yellow clips, and a giant blow out brush.  If you have thick curly or wavy frizzy hair you need to have this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will tame it down in record time.  It has some kind of special technology.  This is serious business.  The ceramic technology is very gentle to my hair.  The ionic technology has gotten rid of every bit of frizz, something I would never have believed possible, especially with no conditioner on it.  These aren&#x27;t just gimmicky words. The results are the proof it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if someone had told me that the right dryer would do this for my hair I wouldn&#x27;t have believed them.  Now I know how my stylist gets my hair so sleek and smooth and frizz free.  She is going to be seeing a lot less of me now that I can make my hair look as good as she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this hair dryer?  You bet I do.  This dryer is one of my rare ten star products.  Fabulous.</li>
    <li> ****************&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 08/20/2014&lt;br /&gt;My wife has declared that she likes this hairdryer BETTER than the much more expensive Elchim.  She says the temperature controls on this are better (especially, the cooler setting is much more comfortably cool whereas the Elchim tends to always be either hot or hotter).  As noted in the original review, the Conair also has the button that kills the heat and she loves that now, too.  8 months and still going strong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing she doesn&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally hit a button and change the blower speed and/or temperature while using.&lt;br /&gt;****************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate loud hairdryers.  I don&#x27;t even use them and I hate them.  My wife doesn&#x27;t mind them as much as I do, but I was insistent that she preserve her hearing and not have a loud, whining motor right by her ears every morning, so I did some research and wound up purchasing a expensive, professional grade blow dryer by Elchim.  We both loved it and it served us well for years, until the cord started wearing out from being wound up around itself all the time and eventually we had to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this Conair model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so the Elchim is SLIGHTLY quieter, but not much at all.  The power output (as in the amount of air it blows) is pretty much the same.  There are 3 heat settings (none, low and high) and 3 fan speeds (off, low, high) on both, although the Conair adds a button to quickly and temporarily kill the heat.  Both have a removable filter in the back, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only significant differences are that the Conair is slightly larger the Elchim is significantly more expensive and the Conair is significantly more colorful (as to whether that&#x27;s good or bad is up to you).  It&#x27;s too early to rate based on longevity, but at this price, you could get 2 or 3 of the Conairs for the price of 1 Elchim which would mean that the Elchim would have to last 2-3 times as long as this Conair.  Our last Elchim lasted for about 6 years, if I recall, which means as long as this lasts for at least 2 years, then we&#x27;re good.  I bet we&#x27;ll get that, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.r last Elchim lasted for about 6 years, if I recall, which means as long as this lasts for at least 2 years, then we&#x27;re good.

    <li> The surprise for me in using this hair dryer is how it can straighten hair.  This type of hair dryer is probably what professional hair stylists use for that purpose.  According to the instruction manual that came with it, this dryer produces some infrared heat along with negative ions that reduce frizz by up to 75% when compared to DC motor natural ion hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first time I used this type of hair dryer, so it really confirmed to me that I never had a good hair dryer before.  It&#x27;s also large compared to what I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I have traditionally used less expensive hair dryers, though once I discovered the joy of dryers like this one, I&#x27;ll never go back. My hair is dry in about a minute - fully dry, even the back (which is about 2 inches past my shoulders) that is left wet with other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with a concentrator which is easy to put on, hair separator clips, three rollers, and a hairbrush.  The nozzle on this dryer is already narrow and thus you get very focused air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Dries SUPER fast&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with some nice additional items&lt;br /&gt;- Noticeably reduces frizz&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight for a full size dryer (1875 watts)&lt;br /&gt;- Fun colors&lt;br /&gt;- Fast cold shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- No diffuser (I don&#x27;t use one)&lt;br /&gt;- A little too easy to hit the rocker switches and change your settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer! I have long fine hair and my hair kept getting caught in my last blowdryer. This one not only dries my hair much faster, it is ionic so doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and it never gets caught in the dryer anymore! I highly recommend this item. Only negative I can find is the weight so probably not for kids but an excellent choice for adults and salon staff.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic hairdryer with a few bonus items, including a nice round brush. I do like the hairdryer; I&#x27;m pleased with my ability to dry and style my hair quickly and get it smooth and shiny. However, I realized I can&#x27;t tell much difference between it and my similar 5-year-old Conair Ionic Ceramic Cord Keeper 1875 Watt Model 209R. I can&#x27;t tell there&#x27;s a difference in performance, and really that&#x27;s probably a good indication on the lifespan of any similar Conair. They&#x27;re similar size, shape and weight (not too heavy) and feature the same buttons/settings. The Infinity Pro does not have a retractable cord while the older one does. The concentrator seems identical and the Infinity Pro does not come with a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is large, for full smooth body, and slides through my hair easily. The clips and rollers are nice to have and do their job, but aren&#x27;t something everyone will use and don&#x27;t seem to be different than what you could get purchase very inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this dryer, the brush is good, and the other accessories are fine. But honestly, you might find you&#x27;d prefer to shop for a similar Conair and pick accessories on your own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the power of the air from this unfortunately colored hair dryer, as well as the heat level.  It&#x27;s noticeably hotter than the other hair dryer I use.  It was easy to clean the filter and the cord is of a good length with a nice sturdy hanging loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are left handed, you may accidentally flip the switches due to their unusual placement on the side of the handle.  If you can use your right hand, this won&#x27;t be an issue, but for most people, you probably use both hands, so this is possibly an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is noticeably quieter than most competitors, but still puts out a nice amount of power. It&#x27;s not &#x27;quiet&#x27; per se, but it&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included round brush is what you would expect from a freebie included in a budget priced model... it&#x27;s functional but not high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this is a good hair dryer and a good price.</li>
    <li> Dries the hair in record time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m by no means a discerning consumer of hair dryers, though I use one every day. If it lasts, blows warm air, and isn&#x27;t too loud, I&#x27;m good to go. This one falls into that category and generally just gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking dryer and it comes equipped with all sorts of accessories.  My wife liked the idea of the rollers and clips, but found that they didn&#x27;t really work for her.  The brush was very difficult to get through tangled hair (even after conditioning), so she won&#x27;t be using that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is no reason not to get this dryer, since we rarely buy a dryer for the accessories.  The concentrator was easy to put on and take off, although she found that the vents on the sides let more air out than she would have wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has lots of power - two speed settings, and three heat settings.  She found the Hot to be a bit too hot, so she mostly uses the Warm, which worked just fine for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her major complain is the placement of the toggle switches/buttons.  They are on the side of the handle, which pretty much guarantees that you are going to accidentally hit them from time to time. During drying she has changed the temperature setting, and even turned off the dryer inadvertently, several times.  If the buttons were in front (like other dryers), it would be easier to avoid this.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful and fairly lightweight hair dryer. The hot blows very hot, and it has a cool button to blow cold air. It comes with a nice set of accessories. Clips, brush, velcro rollers large round vent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works nicely and fits comfortably in your hand. A good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. Different temps and speeds are as advertised. Cool shot works well. I&#x27;ve only had mine a few weeks, so i&#x27;ll have to update later if something goes awry. I have fine, straight hair and use this for &amp;#34;blow outs&amp;#34; which makes my hair voluminous for 8-10 hours with the aid of root lift and styling mousse. Also the color is fun and easy to find in my box of hair tools.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair so much body and that is hard with pin straight short hair.</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer. It dryers hair faster, and my hair is less frizzy and more soft now. I like this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to admit that I have *not* actually tried this for it&#x27;s marketed purpose.  I&#x27;m consistently letting my hair curl at them moment, and didn&#x27;t want to harass my delicate curls just for the purpose of reviewing this.  However, it has been tested with a diffuser on curls and with the concentrator on straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about that in a moment, first I have to throw in that this dryer *does NOT include a diffuser.*  Normally, that would have cost it a star with me, but since it&#x27;s specifically marketed for \\&quot;Blow-Outs,\\&quot; it would not be fair to mark it down for that.  However, if you are in the market for a straightening sort of dryer, it is possible you have some curl, and if you have some curl, perhaps you want to know, WHAT SIZE DIFFUSER will fit this.  So, I measured the dryer opening.  Outer edge to outer edge, the circumference is 1 7/8 inches; inner edge to inner edge the circumference is 1 3/4 inches.  I found that one of my existing diffusers, the one form my Remington Pearl dryer (which, ironically does not fit my other Infiniti dryer, but fits this one well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, (though I prefer airdrying, which is rarely practical), I am very pleased with this dryer!!  It has performed well for me.  My favorite thing about it is that it has a really nice range of temperatures.  Sometimes the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; temperature on a dryer is quite indistinguishable from low or high, or the cool shot isn&#x27;t cool at all.  This dryer offers a full, distinct range of temperature high-to-low, and the cool blast is truly cool.  Also, I&#x27;ve been successful in holding the cool-shot button down for long periods of time---and it actually stays cool.  Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother borrowed this to blow dry her stick-straight, rather thin hair.  She was surprised by how much she preferred it to her older dryer.  Really nice concentrator on this thing, very efficient air distribution.  She was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus items:  The Velcro rollers are not bad quality.  Five might have been a better number.  I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the clips for clipping up my roots for root lift!  They are the perfect size.  The brush feels a little cheap, but the inner metal rim does help with the blow out process.  All-in-all, I think this is a good package of items to get one into a good technique for blow outs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nicely survived some rough handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small flaws:&lt;br /&gt;It did not eliminate frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I did not like the loud colors but they&#x27;ve grown on me.  I would probably still prefer another color, but these are fun.  And the yellow does make it easy to find!&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was slightly more ergonomically designed and had better weight distribution.  I think they may have engineered this for a man&#x27;s hands or perhaps just a larger woman&#x27;s hand.  It feels slightly heavy and unwieldy with prolonged use (and my hair takes a prolonged amount of hair to dry).  My mother also remarked on the weight.re not bad quality.

    <li> I&#x27;m always eager to try a new hair dryer as I have very long wavy hair and it&#x27;s a chore to blow out. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t quite THE one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very powerful stream of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The hot is HOT. If you leave it too long in one spot you will definitely feel it on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The concentrator is movable in full 360 degree rotation (the current one I have is not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cool burst is in a good spot and when you add the basic cool air stream, you get a nicely cool flow of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The toggle buttons switch off too easily. I accidentally turned mine off, to warm, to cool, etc., probably 15 times while I was drying my hair. Completely annoying and almost a complete deal breaker for me--overriding most of the Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The included brush is horrible. It looks like it will be good, but within the first five minutes I had thrown it aside and was using my own brush. The plastic is too hard--I&#x27;d much rather the forgiving nature of a bristle + plastic brush--I felt like this brush pulled out a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side. I could feel it after the first five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEH THINGS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is called a Blow-Out Essentials version, I&#x27;d much rather a butterfly-style claw clip was included instead of a simple clip, as that clip won&#x27;t hold much of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s three-star okay. I don&#x27;t love it and I don&#x27;t hate it but it just isn&#x27;t really for me.</li>
    <li> Update: After using this dryer for a few months, it has already broken. It was never dropped or damaged in any way but one day it just started whistling very, very loudly. I was afraid it was going to shoot flames at me! I have had a great experience with my other Conair dryers and this was very disappointing. 2 Thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an ionic Conair Infiniti for a few years now. It is still running great. This new version of the Infiniti addressed some of the complaints I had with the older version and for that, I like it much more. The buttons are easier to switch on/off and to change settings. (the old one I had to dig my fingernail in to slide over because they were flat buttons) The new version is lighter weight, and feels more comfortable in my hand. It is also not as loud. This kit comes with a very nice blow out brush, 3 rollers and 3 sectioning pins. I have no use for the rollers and pins but my teenage daughter uses them daily. The ionic technology is important for drying my hair quickly and without added frizz. The former Infiniti was a good dryer and has lasted me for many years, but I have switched to this one and like it more for the improvements.</li>
    <li> Just purchased about 2 weeks ago.  I thought I liked this hair dryer but I have come to realize I cannot use the high setting.  It blows way too hard making it difficult to dry my hair using a round brush.  It could just be my hair, I have used it a couple times on the medium setting and the blower seems to go in &amp; out from medium to low on it&#x27;s own.  Have no idea what is causing this.  I do like that the dryer gets to a nice hot temperature setting.  The dryer has a good feel as though it is made well.  Might be considered a little on the heavy side for some.  I am considering returning due to the fact I am not really using it.</li>
    <li> I am African american and have natural 4b hair.  I have been searching for an affordable hair dryer for a while now. I feel like this blow dryer is just what I have been looking for.  It is very powerful!!  Way more powerful than my previous dryer.  I like that it has adjustable settings (hot, warm, cool, low, medium and high).  I used this to blow dry out my natural hair and it worked very well.  I kept it on medium/warm and it got my hair dry in no time.  My hair was very soft after using this dryer and I was pleased with the results.  I didnt use the brush that came with it, I used an old one I am used to using.  I purchased this at TJMaxx for $29 and am happy with my purchase. I will say my dryer has a little bit of a rattle sound, but it works well, so I don&#x27;t plan on returning it.  Plus it has a 4 year warranty!  Its loud, so if you are concerned about sound, its not a quiet dryer.  Also, it is a bit heavy, but those types of things don&#x27;t bother me, its not like Im holding it for hours.</li>
    <li> so obsessed that i own 2 in fear that the first one i got will burn out one day! haha-</li>
