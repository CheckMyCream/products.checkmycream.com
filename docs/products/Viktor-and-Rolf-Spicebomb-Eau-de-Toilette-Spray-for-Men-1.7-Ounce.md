<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> my husband was pleased with the fragrance.  he never leaves home without it, and that&#x27;s fine by me....i love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really great and the bottle is really cool too! Buy some now and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  The product didn&#x27;t last all day.  The smell is OK but after a couple of days, it just kind of bugged me.  I went back to tried and true Drakkar....much cheaper too!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its authenticity, but my husband and myself absolutely LOVE this stuff. It smells great and stays on for hours and hours; not too overpoweringly, too.</li>
    <li> From the moment I got a whiff of this scent on a male friend I found myself saying &amp;#34;My goodness, that smells incredible! What IS that?!&amp;#34; The following day I immediately purchased it for my boyfriend so that I could enjoy the scent on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the name &amp;#34;Spicebomb&amp;#34; says it all. When you spray it on, it is as if you have let off a bomb of piercing sexy, masculine spice. The scent is strong, but very pleasant, and it pulls you in. Every time my boyfriend applies it, I find myself gravitating in his direction to get a better whiff. It&#x27;s that good. He loves the smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Paco Rabanne 1 Million, you will probably like this as well. It has that same spice-based scent, although 1 Million has added notes of sweetness, whereas Spicebomb is more intense and full-on spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne I received was 100% authentic and smells exactly like it does in the store. However, after reading some other reviews stating that the item received was watered down or not authentic, I made sure to purchase directly from Amazon.com, LLC rather than any of the other sellers to avoid a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon also cannot be beat. The same 1.7oz bottle costs $90 everywhere else, almost double the price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Spicebomb aka &amp;#34;The Pantie Dropper&amp;#34;. Its a going out scent and good to get a ladies attention. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for work as you would want something more toned down. Great scent guys.</li>
    <li> I wear Flowerbomb and my husband loved it so much that he wanted the men&#x27;s version so I went ahead or ordered it without even testing it first.. Flowerbomb smells absolutely amazing so I had a feeling that Spicebomb would smell amazing as well, and I was right.  It&#x27;s a sexy, manly scent unlike any other cologne out there.  Highly,highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice.  If you like woodsy this may not be for you.  It&#x27;s a little sweet, but because of the different layers it changes over time.  I would buy it again.  It&#x27;s more for summer days.  Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells once sets after spraying​ it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband even though I hadn&#x27;t smelled it before because it had such great reviews. It is a very delicious, manly, spicy scent. He loves it and I do too! The price on Amazon couldn&#x27;t be beat either.</li>
    <li> but super nice too. i love it, but not everyone does so i gave it a i like it. if you do get it, wear sparingly</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance but the spray cap falls off all the time... other then that I would have given it a five star rating!</li>
    <li> I am SUPER PISSED!!!  I purchased Spicebomb for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day - 2014! I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT!! The SECRET CODE is gone and that tells me that the packaging has been VIOLATED! I read previous reviews and it seems THE ISSUE WITH PACKAGING TAMPERING had been resolved that is the ONLY REASON I PURCHASED because it was being shipped FROM AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO UPSET that I got taken advantage of...TO ALL BUYERS BEWARE that this product is still not an accurate description of what YOU ACTUALLY RECEIVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TRY TO SAVE A FEW CENTS to GET A PRODUCT THAT IS INACCURATE AND DISENCHANTING!! THIS IS NOT A TRUE PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic value!!!! I bought this bigger size for less than the travel size at a department store! And it arrived so quickly!!! Thank u!!!</li>
    <li> I have had so  many women come up to me asking what I am wearing, This stuff is the bomb and women LOVVEEEE IT</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and it smells good for hours.  Guess I got a good batch. I will be purchasing another bottle for family.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This smells great! The vendor sent this in the time requested and I was happy about that because it was a gift for my nephew. He loved it. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> First quality and a great scent. I highly recommend this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the best!  My husband wears it often and he loves it too!  I think that this cologne would be best for guys that are a little older. The smell is for a more mature audience.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Son loves this cologne and it was at the top of his christmas list.  Wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but it really does have a since fragrance for a man.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling cologne&#x27;s my husband has every worn! Love it!!! It&#x27;s a very original scent!</li>
    <li> Just tested this against a sample that I got at Nordstrom and it&#x27;s fake. Also, the code inside the box has been carefully removed. Now I find that you can&#x27;t return colognes to Amazon. RIP-OFF. Should have read the reviews prior to purchase!!!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my comment to another buyers response to a question regarding authenticity guaranteed via purchase through Amazon: \\&quot;That&#x27;s not exactly true. I purchased Spicebomb from Amazon.com, Amazon was the seller in question, and I received a fake product. The label had been carefully removed from inside the box. I also had a sample from a dept store and the two were quite different. The purchase made through Anazon had been diluted and the scent only lasted for less than one hour. Not exactly a Spicebomb.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband ... it&#x27;s a cologne that both me and him can enjoy! and it has some spice to it!!! I really recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Cinnamon&#x27;y and good, plus sturdy and compact bottle and the detachable mock grenade pin/clamp prevents the plunger from going down (and spraying) so good for travel. Take the clamp out with your teeth for dramatic effect and yell &amp;#34;incoming&amp;#34; as you spray about, people will not appreciate your humor or understand it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a liquid aphrodisiac-I love it</li>
    <li> I have it next to my 3.4 oz and it compares nicely in size.  It&#x27;s has an exotic smell.  The spray safety has the Viktor Rolf label.  It gives it an expensive designer look to the bottle.</li>
    <li> Good scent for the summer and spring.</li>
    <li> initially bought a sample of this off eBay. Love it enjoy the sense 1 or 2 sprays last a good three hours. I recommend it to anybody who doesn&#x27;t want an overpowering order</li>
    <li> I have over 30 different colognes, had never smelled this, I purchased flowerbomb for a friend and she and I loved it. Spicebomb isn&#x27;t as unique as flowerbomb but still good</li>
    <li> Sensual scent. Lasts all day and lingers in clothing. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cologne. Very, very strong and unique scent, possibly a little too strong for some people. I use it mainly in situations where I need a scent that stands out and can be easily detected, so it is perfect for nightclubs, dance parties and other events with a high density of people.&lt;br /&gt;  Viktor and Rolf is a small brand compared to the likes of Nautica, Burberry, Chanel, and Ralph Lauren, so you will likely be the only one wearing V&amp;R at your next event, which only works to your advantage. The actual fragrance is very musky, with a sweet &amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34; (only way I can describe it). Truly unique, it is completely exotic to most people, but unmistakeable to anyone who has had experience with it. My friends say they have never smelled anything like it when they borrow it.&lt;br /&gt;  The scent is very masculine, the polar opposite of floral based colognes, so while it is great in situations where you will be meeting many women, it&#x27;s likely too much for romance with your significant other, so use very little unless she says she craves it.&lt;br /&gt;  The design of the bottle is, in one word, iconic. The black grenade styling speaks to the sometimes overpowering strength, and it&#x27;s unabashed appeal towards the male market. It feels natural in your hand, more so than any other bottle I have used. The pull-pin is a small but significant addition that is the icing on the cake for this design, and in my cologne collection this is the only bottle I openly display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: This cologne has a unique, masculine, exotic scent that is very strong with a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; aftertaste, and you have to be careful not to use too much in certain situations. The design of the bottle gives it a natural grip in your hand, and is unique, functional, and beautiful. This is one of the more expensive colognes in my collection, but it is my most used one and to me it is worth every penny I spend on it.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend love it she say the smell is great to me is like i expected i expend my money very good</li>
    <li> I like to smell good.  But I also build things out of wood and smash enemies with stones and fists.  What a dilemma.  Should I have to smell like lilies and roses and petchouli oil?  Nonsense.  I kill lilies, roses, and petchouli oil!  This stuff smells spicy and intriguing, with pure sharp masculinity, no daisy stuff here!  And my wife LOVES it</li>
    <li> He tried it as a tester and ordered it immediately.  If smells so good on him.  I highly recommend this cologne for your man.  He won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells decent but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s the same scent I smelled at the store.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and is not strong for a mens cologne.  If you are a man that does not like very strong smelling colognes you might like this one.  Pretry good price also!</li>
    <li> very spicy. A great scent to wear during the holidays. Theres also a scent of vanilla too. My boyfriend liked this.</li>
    <li> The box could have been in better condition then what it was, I gave the cologne as a gift and ish the box wasn&#x27;t beat up.</li>
    <li> Opinion (1st cologne review of 4): This is one of the best smelling scents, but also not a scent I would wear everyday. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a scent I&#x27;d wear to a party. I&#x27;d also consider it to be more of a unisex scent, slightly leaning more towards masculine. It really delivers the spices, and smells awesome for a short period of time. Finally, this is a scent you&#x27;d want to apply more sparingly because it&#x27;s a strong scent. 5 stars as a going out scent, but 4 stars as an everyday scent. Out of all the scents I wear, I receive the most compliments with this one, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour or so. Peace</li>
    <li> my son liked it, but has other favorites.</li>
    <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite colognes in my collection. I first smelled it in a magazine and couldn&#x27;t believe how incredible it smells. Like the name suggests, it&#x27;s made of a ton of different spices that make a man stand out from the crowd. One or two spritzes on your wrists and neck is enough to make a woman (or man) want you. I saw this at Sephora at the mall once, and it&#x27;s definitely a bit pricey. Luckily, I bought mine from Amazon for maybe $20 less. I also love that instead of a lid, there&#x27;s a pin you pull to spray it. Check it out!</li>
    <li> The initial scent of this cologne is so different from other colognes. Usually male colognes come on extremely strong with grassy scents and smell very bitter- they usually scream \\&quot;I AM A MAN\\&quot;. Spicebomb is different, it begins with cinnamon and pepper with none of the bitterness. It is very smooth almost like a musk but with a lot more dimension. I think there is a little citrus in it as well. I spray it in my room, in my car and all over myself. The downside of this cologne is that it is a little pricey and it does not last as long as I would like. I would say after 2 hours the scent no longer projects and it just lingers on the skin. I hope this never gets discontinued! I am the pickiest person when it comes to colognes. I don&#x27;t own 20 different colognes like some people I just own two: Black by Kenneth Cole and my #1 - Spicebomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf.</li>
    <li> Not really a cologne guy, but thought it was time to upgrade my style.  Spicebomb smells awesome and my girlfriend loves it.  Really enjoying this product.</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> Spices make it an extraordinary smell...catches attention...</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim- my husband likes Flowerbomb on me by Viktor &amp; Rolf, so I thought &amp;#34;Why not be ultra-cheesy and have matching scents?&amp;#34; Totally worked. It&#x27;s sweet and has strong tones of cedar and woods. It&#x27;s delicious! It&#x27;s definitely not for every one- but it&#x27;s a small enough bottle I vote give it a shot. It smells similar to Joop and Blue Sugar.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it! Thanks again</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend and he loved it!  The price could not be beat and it was in fact, the real deal!</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars because the smell is so addicting! The price that Amazon sells it for is unbelievable. I would like to say that the product is genuine and the packaging has not been tampered with. I recommend everyone to buy it!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best cologne on the market! The scent is remarkable. Every man should have this in their collection!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. The vendor responded immediately to my request and provided excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> PERFECT MIXTURE !AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ALSO I WILL SOON ORDER ANOTHER BOTTLE OF THE SPICE BOMB THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I got the bottle right away with no issues. Love the smell it&#x27;s very suttle and the women love it esp my beautiful wife, she said it smells so good she falls in love with me again. It&#x27;s like woodsy and spice in one. Very great smell and would reccomend to any guy that would want to make they special lady fall in love with you.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality Prodcut and Speedy service. Highly recommend to any other buyer.  The product is amazing, GF loves it, thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Smells real good. I&#x27;ve been complemented by a pretty woman and even my barber likes it.</li>
    <li> WHEN YOU CALL THIS COMPANY THE ONLY PERSON YOU CAN TALK TO IS MIGEEL WHO WILL NOT HELP YOU I BELIEVE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY IMPORTANT THEY WILL NOT HELP</li>
    <li> I wear this on those crisp mornings when I want a warm, sexy, spicy scent. Yeah, who woulda thunk this is an ah- mazing scent for women?  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of florals--too girly. I like masculine scents, but don&#x27;t want to smell like a man, and this fit the bill.</li>
    <li> GET COMPLIMENTS  ALL THE TIME! love the SMOKY FULL SEXY SMELL. i LOVE THIS AS EVERYONE AROUND ME WANTS TO SMELL ME! SO MUCH FUN HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT SMELL IN THE ELEVATOR AND YOU KNOW ITS YOU.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great smell, great pice!</li>
    <li> Great Smelling Cologne</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Great scent. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne to wear, and not just because its my newest one. Bitches give me hugs.</li>
    <li> This Cologne was recommended to me by one of our male friends, he swore up and down how amazing this cologne is.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order this Cologne as I was leaving the country and leaving my man on our first anniversary alone:( I didn&#x27;t know what I was ordering I have never smelled this cologne before and hoping he would like it.I left him a anniversary card on the kitchen counter and told him your gift is in the mail hopefully you like it.&lt;br /&gt;as I was across the world I ran into the duty free store and ask them if they had Spicebomb Cologne so I can smell and see what I have order for my man.&lt;br /&gt; amazing:)</li>
