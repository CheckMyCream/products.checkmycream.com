<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great blow dryer been useing same one 10 years light weight too, hard too find</li>
    <li> I love my new hairdryer. As someone who has very thick hair, I&#x27;m used to having to hold a dryer until my arm almost falls off to get my hair dry. I would often stop before the job was quite finished because I was running out of time. Now that I can dry my hair much faster with my new pretty red dryer, those problems are no more; my arm feels better and I don&#x27;t have to run out of the house with damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took it out of the box, I was disappointed by the weight of this dryer, because, as I said, I&#x27;m used to having to hold a dryer until my arm hurts, and this one is heavy. But when I used it, I was pleasantly surprised to find that weight is not a factor here. For one thing, I don&#x27;t have to hold this dryer for as long because it&#x27;s faster, but also the position of the handle distributes the weight more evenly, so it doesn&#x27;t become a chore to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, speed is the most important factor for me, I also appreciate this dryer&#x27;s overall design, both for the ergonomics and for its streamlined, futuristic look. Plus it feels like a bonus that it&#x27;s  my favorite color, red. But I can really sum up why I like this dryer in just a few words: Yes, this dryer is faster.</li>
    <li> Goody Heat Flash Blow Dry.  Is a new blow drier that Goody is putting out this qtr.  I was fortunate enough to receive this beauty of a dry.  For me the dryer works great for my hair.  Dries pretty fast and I do like.  It is a little heavier than it looks but that would have to be the only down fall for me.  Which is workable and its worth the great price.  For me I want something that is going to dry my hair without taking 1/2 hour to do.  Which this has cut my drying time in half.  I used it on my daughters hair and it was great.  It has a couple of accessories that worked awesome on my daughters curly hair.  She was not afraid.  So overall I do like the dry it worked great for our family and look forward to more great and exciting products from GOODY..</li>
    <li> Drys your hair really fast!</li>
    <li> While I was visiting my friend in another city, I borrowed her hairdryer....it then caught on fire. Oops. It was a sunbeam hair dryer that she has used since we were in junior high (now out of college). Needless to say she wasn&#x27;t used to the best, but it got the job done. I purchased this for her the next morning on my phone and she got it two days later. She sent me a text to thank me and then a second a few days later saying that she REALLY liked it. Could be she was just used to a terribly outdated hair dryer, but for the price I&#x27;m guessing it was a great find.</li>
    <li> I have received this product as a sample to try out and I love it. I have straight hair that usually frizzes easy and is pretty thick. I usually use a Helen of troy hair dryer and my hair is all over when I am done and it takes like an hour or two to dry it usually. With this product my hair is not frizzy at all and is easier to manage. It also took only 20-30 minutes to dry so it works way better for me than my old dryer I would recommend the Goody Flash Dry Dryer to anyone that wants more manageable hair and wants to cut down there hair drying time by alot. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> the color is very pretty !i like it !and it fast to dry my hair.i think it good price to own</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t pick hair care products because they look like rock stars or super models, but his Goody Heat Flash Blow Dryer is pretty.  When I received this dryer as a sample I was very skeptical of the packaging claims for faster drying and smoother hair.  This Goody really proved itself.  I first tried it on my daughters very thick, wavy, waist length hair.  I was amazed when her dripping hair was completely dry in 14 minutes!  Ok, so it&#x27;s fast, but what about smooth.  I tried it on myself next.  I have thick hair that reaches half way down my back.  It tends to frizz when dried.  After I used this Goody my hair was noticeably smoother.  I wanted a second opinion to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me wanting to see smoother hair, so I asked my hubby what he thought.  He noticed the same thing.  It does live up to it&#x27;s claims. I didn&#x27;t have trouble with the switches like some other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;A few things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is heavy, and it will suck errant hairs into the back. (I noticed that when drying my daughter&#x27;s hair and a few of mine were traveling toward the back of the dryer.)  The tip is not flat but pointed at the top.  This takes a bit of getting used to when using it.  Because the dryer moves so much air it is louder than my Revlon dryer but not high pitched or squeally.&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:  I like it.  I&#x27;ll keep it and use it.</li>
    <li> I have almost shoulder length fine thin hair.I have been having a major problem with frizzy hair. I used this today to dry my hair I really didn&#x27;t notice any time difference but with my fine hair it is usually 2 minutes. I think the time saving will be more noticed with long or thick hair. What I did see is 80% reduction to frizz and more shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is a large one and on the heavy side as dryers go. It feels like professional quality. I had no trouble with the weight but just wanted to mention if weight is an issue for you. I used it on low and warm then finished with the cold blast. The blast button is well placed you don&#x27;t hit it by accident. It gives a good cool blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the diffuser and a smoothing concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 3 year warranty that you need to register within 30 days and save your proof of purchase. If you do not have the proof but you registered within 30 days then your warranty will be 24 months from the date of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this dryer it does what it claims.</li>
    <li> i wanted a hair dryer that put out some high wind out. it does that and has suficient heat to make it comfortable to use.i hope it last for a little while/price was great!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer really lived up to a lot of my expectations.  My hair is pretty thick and can take a long time to try, but after reading the other reviews, I thought this would work for me.  It really did cut my drying time down, and the features are great.  Plus, that color is flawless.  The only downside for me is that the dryer is a lot heavier that I expected, and quite top heavy.  The pros outweigh this though and I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, sleek and durable blow dryer. Very easy to handle and operate. Cool color. I would definitely Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Goody Heat Flash Dry Blow Dryer! I had the opportunity to review the Goody Heat Flash Dry Blow Dryer. I received this blow - dryer a few weeks ago. I wanted to use it a few times before I made my review! Let me start by saying I have curly fine hair but a lot of it! My hair is to the middle of my back! It usually takes me about 40 mins to get my hair completely dry! I have to say this works great it cut down my drying time in half! It left my hair nice and straight and frizz free. That is a huge plus for me! I would have to say the only con is that it is a bit heavy and bulky! Other than I love my new blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is part of a new line that Goody is debuting this spring, and it&#x27;s a nice dryer for this price range.  It definitely isn&#x27;t quite as strong as my Sedu Revolution dryer, but at this price point, it&#x27;s effective and works much better than the Revlon and Conair dryers I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has several speed and heat settings that enable you to really customize your drying process, and it also has a cool-shot button to seal in your style and a \\&quot;max speed\\&quot; button to really rev things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer also has an angled edge to it that made me think that it would only work with the diffuser and concentrator it came with, but my regular diffuser stays on it just fine, and doesn&#x27;t pop off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely a bit noisy, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a dryer that is more powerful.  It&#x27;s fairy light-weight, too, so your arm doesn&#x27;t get too tired holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good dryer and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this item a few weeks ago and really could not wait to use it. I have a old Con Air hand dryer that I have had for over 15 years and it was on its last leg so this one arrived just in time. I really like the design and the durablity of the dryer. I found it very easy to use and lightweight. I found the heat setting were perfect for my hair. I have hair that drys very fast and this did the trick in half the time. I would really recommend this product to someone in the market for a hand dryer. I found that I really did not have to put a lot of force into the brush to get my hair straight. This is by far on of the best dryers that I own now and pray it last just as long as my previous one.</li>
    <li> It is a little heavier then I expected but I love it. It makes my hair straight and smooth. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is wonderful, and does everything claimed by the manufacturer!  Drys hair very quickly-my hair is VERY thick!  It does promote shine, and does not cause injury or irritation to the scalp! I recommend this for anyone, all ages, and especially if one has a tender scalp or diabetes.  I loved it so much, I wanted to share it with my neighbor, who gets up at 5AM, for early hours of working as a Navy Physician&#x27;s Assistant!  Her spouse , who also uses it(Marine flyer), says it saves much time, and leaves hair soft and easy to manage!  I ordered another!  Better get this fast, even Amazing Amazon has a hard time keeping this in stock!</li>
    <li> Immediately upon pulling this out of the box, I could tell this weighed more than my current hair dryer. Its huge, its a beast, compared to my old one. I was excited to give it a go and it performs as well as I had hoped. It dried my hair VERY fast, under 5 minutes. I almost always blow dry my hair straight and i have very long hair, about 3/4 of the way down my back. It has worked out great for me. I feel like my hair is even a bit straighter and i think this is because of how much air is blown out so quickly. It leaves my hair slightly softer and frizz free. I never have had issues with too much frizz but after trying this i could tell my hair lays a tad bit smoother. I also noticed that this dryer does not get super hot. I have to hold it in the same place awhile for it to start to burn, which i think is a good idea considering how much air it can blow out. If it was hot i think it could be dangerous, so the temp on this does not get freakishly hot, its just warm. I give this another positive point since really high heat is bad for your hair anyway. Overall i would recommend this to people with long hair, who want to get it dry as quickly as possible. It&#x27;s definitely a time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;added 4/24/12:&lt;br /&gt;after owning a few months now, i still really love my hair dryer. when i use someone else&#x27;s i giggle because theirs seems sooo weak. it would be really hard for me to go back to a &#x27;regular&#x27; hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 4/1/14(AND NO THIS ISNT AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE): i am STILL using this hairdryer on a day to day basis and it is working GREAT. It is still the most powerful hairdryer i&#x27;ve come across and it has held up great. i would highly recommend this for its power and longevity!!</li>
    <li> Powerful.  I owned one of these for several years.  It did break.  I looked at Target and Walmart and it&#x27;s so hard to choose.  This is a powerful (lots of air and heat) hair dryer.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Goody Flash Dry blow dryer as a sample and I must say it is a sexy, sleek blow dryer that cuts down on dry time. It&#x27;s tip has a strange angle and at first I was a little confused as to how to aim it, but I quickly learned that the purpose was to direct the heat down the hair shaft for less frizz. I have long hair and it&#x27;s usually a cumbersome ordeal every morning, but this definitely cut down on dry time and I did notice there was no need for any serums to de-frizz, which I typically use. Great Blow Dryer</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that I have to air dry..if i don&#x27;t it takes forever to blow dry and it gets super frizzy...until I got this blow dryer! It dries my hair super fast...it&#x27;s crazy and no frizz! I would highly recommend this blow dryer. No more walking around like a wet rat, or getting up early so my hair could air dry!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to tell you that a hair dryer is an essential appliance, particularly if you have long hair.  I mostly use mine to dry my six year old&#x27;s hair, leaving it glossier, less frizzy, and reducing the chances that her head will freeze on the way to school.  I was glad to get the chance to test this dryer, which promises better and faster drying times than the \\&quot;leading dryer.\\&quot;  Unfortunately, my family and I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the performance of this dryer and our existing dryer, the [[ASIN:B000FS05VG Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]].  Both are 1875 watt tourmaline dryers, and as far as we can tell, they dry hair in about the same time.  Maybe the \\&quot;leading\\&quot; dryer is not 1875 watt tourmaline.  Although the Goody is a very good drier, I&#x27;m sorry to report that my family prefers the Revlon.  It&#x27;s significantly lighter, slightly quieter, and very affordable.  The Goody is a little bulkier and louder, but might be the right choice for someone who wants the styling tools.</li>
    <li> This is a deep red metallic finish hair dryer with a futuristic look. It&#x27;s very sleek and stylish and somewhat large.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly does shorten drying time.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a diffuser attachment for creating fuller volume to hair and also a \\&quot;smoothing concentrator\\&quot; which helps direct the air flow to certain sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button runs smoothly and allows for styling hair while drying. There are three heat settings and two air speed selections which is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;My experience with it proves to me that it does a great job drying in less time and it does keep hair soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite hair dryer and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer for the last month now.  My hair is long and past my shoulders.  I have loved the results I&#x27;ve been getting.  Not only does it dry my hair faster than my old one it leaves me hair frizz free and smooth.  It is large, but light weight and easy to use.  It has 3 heat settings to choose from, 2 air speeds, cool shot button and a Max speed button.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Gets hot nicely, loved by me and my daughter!</li>
    <li> It is the best hair dryer I have ever used. It is so fast to make my hair dry compare with my other hair dryers. It looks like a hair dryer from a beauty salon. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to receive a sample of this product to test.  There is now a daily &#x27;fight&#x27; between my daughter and wife on who gets to use this drier instead of their &#x27;old&#x27; drier.  Once this drier hits the market for sale, I will defintaly be purchasing a second.  I personally do not need a blow drier to style my hair, but during the winter months I use one to make sure my hair is completely dry before leaving the house when it is &lt;20 degrees outside.  I have short hair, but this takes it from damp/towel dry to completely dry in 15 to 20 seconds; great for those days when Im in a rush to leave and dont want wet hair frozen to my head.  My wife has shoulder lenght hair, my daughter&#x27;s is much longer.  This works well for both of them.  They both claim their hair isnt as frizzy with this drier compared to their other model (which was supposedly a good one when they bought it).  They say it dries quickly with just the right amount of airflow so it doesnt create a &#x27;hair tornado&#x27; but still performs as needed.  I can personally say that I prefer this model as it doesnt seem nearly as loud as the previous models I have had to tolerate in use while they do their thing every day.  The style is nice, it is comfortable to hold and use.  Between my wife and daughter, and occasionally myself, this gets a lot of use in my home.  While it has only been a couple weeks, it has never overheated or died out from too much use at one time as I have seen many other models do.  I am not a blow dryer expert, but I can say I would recomend this to anyone in search of a good blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I got this with high hopes that it would really cut down my drying time. I have a bob haircut that comes just below my chin and my hair isn&#x27;t thick, so it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry anyway, but it wasn&#x27;t any faster at drying my hair than my basic [[ASIN:B000FS05VG Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]]. The Goody dryer is much larger and much heavier. It is top heavy as well and a little awkward to hold. It feels almost like the handle has no weight at all and it&#x27;s all in the top part. It makes me think it&#x27;s going to topple out of my hand. My hand was actually a little tired from holding it. I&#x27;m used to my regular dryer and it&#x27;s not heavy at all. This has a hot, warm, and cool setting, then high, low, and off. The only advantage to this dryer that I saw, was that my hair was a little shinier when I used it, but not enough of a difference to make me want to use it over my basic one. So, I will just stick with using my trusty Revlon until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> Before I got this blow dryer, I had been using Conair BB075W Pro Blackbird 2000-Watt Hair Dryer.  The thing I like about this one, though it is less wattage (at 1875) is that the opening is wider.  More air.  I like the fan, and the easy-clean air filter setup better than my other one.  Yes, it is bulky, and bright red, but it has a hanging loop, a volume diffuser, and a smoothing concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have an ACLI safety device on your outlet.  Most places have them, but be sure so the dryer will shut off if there are any inconsistencies with the electrical current, or if the dryer gets accidentally immersed in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a limited 3-year warranty.  You have to read the limitations, and you have to send in the warranty.  There are no replaceable parts, so Goody will replace a bad dryer if conditions are met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a cool shot button, 3 heat settings, 2 air speeds, and a max speed button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair got more curve to it with a round brush and diffuser.  Not together; separately.  I do my bangs with a round brush, and then diffuse it.  My other dryer didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser, and I see it on sale at Amazon for $6.  Not sure if it goes with black bird Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is ionic, ceramic, tourmaline, with a speed fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that there is a slight odd odor coming from the motor.  I docked one star for that.  I will update this if I have anything to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a nice blow dryer, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I really love this hair dryer.  I have been using a Revlon 1875 and so was accustomed to my hair flying all over the place under great heat.  Imagine my surprise when I turned on the hot and high options and my hair didn&#x27;t fly all over the place.  Oh, it moved sure but not all over the place.  And on top of that the hot is not nearly as hot as the Revlon version.  In fact, I had to make sure I had it on the right settings.  And still it blew dried my hair in good time.  So for me this was a real positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test for me though came in the morning.  You see, I usually wash my hair at night and because blow drying my hair often makes it go frizzy in the morning, I often bypass the dryer altogether.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I tried blow-drying my hair before bed.  I was very pleasantly surprised to discover, upon waking, that my hair looked quite reasonable.  Not frizzy in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with a diffuser (which is very helpful as I have slightly wavy hair) and a nozzle to concentrate the air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives are that the Good dryer is quite a bit heavier than the Revlon, making it harder for me to hold.  It&#x27;s also a little loud which may be an issue for folks in the morning.  For me though, there is no question: I far prefer the Goody to my old Revlon.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a hair dryer to replace the one that is no longer made by Conair (Ion Shine 1875) but every one I have purchased has either left my hair feeling like straw or took forever to dry. I have a lot of fine hair and I do NOT use any styling products - just shampoo &amp; conditioner - so there should be no reason it feel like straw. I was a bit skeptical about this dryer because it is quite big with a small nozzle. BUT I was pleasantly surprised that it dried my hair very fast and it felt VERY soft. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is quite loud and I wish there was a temperature between warm and hot - warm is too cool and hot is too hot. Other then that it really is a FABULOUS hair dryer !!! Now I can finally give up my old Conair!</li>
    <li> I must first say that Anthony is my husband; I&#x27;m his wife Sandy, lol! I received this to test for Goody. The appearance of the dryer is very nice; I don&#x27;t usually like red ANYTHING, but the color is a very beautiful shade of red, and the finish makes it look quite upscale. It is heavier than I expected, but given the size of the fan, the weight seems necessary. I have long, thick hair, and this dried my hair MUCH faster than my Revlon dryer. I would say that in my case, it far exceeded the 35% claim on the box. My hair was also much smoother, and it was nice to be able to skip my usual frizz serums, as they tend to migrate up my hair shaft and make my roots oily. That alone is great, because I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often. It also doesn&#x27;t get as hot in my bathroom, which will be a REAL blessing when it heats up here in N.C. this summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of small gripes I have with it are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are used flipping your head upside down to dry your roots for volume, don&#x27;t get the hair dryer too far into your hair, or the fan will suck some of your hair into it. My husband had to help me pull my hair out, which I didn&#x27;t enjoy too much..&lt;br /&gt;2. I found the concentrator to be kinda useless as it can&#x27;t be adjusted to blow the air out vertically, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to Goody that they make a small filter that goes over the end that would keep your hair from being sucked in, and possibly reissue a concentrator that can be adjusted to the preference of the user.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this hair dryer, especially to those girls like me who have long, thick hair that they would like to dry quickly. Nice job, Goody!</li>
    <li> I received this hairdryer from goody to try and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I have so much hair. One of my biggest complaints is how long it takes to dry my hair (my husband DOES NOT want me to cut it). It is such a pain.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer does dry my hair a lot fast than my previous hairdryer. I LOVE the color and styling of the hairdryer although it is a little heavy and you much be very careful when you flip your head over that you do not catch your hair in the fan. No fun if you do.&lt;br /&gt;The button placement leaves a little to be desired but over all - fantastic. Really enjoy the hairdryer and hope it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I received this hair dryer as a product test, and I must say it is the best hair dryer I have used. I love the options of settings - there are 3 temperature and 3 speed settings. I also was not sure if I could believe the claims, but using this dryer left my hair softer and less frizzy. I kept wanting to touch my hair after using this! I really like the fan technology used in this blow dryer. The design is stylish and sleek, but my only complaint is that it is a little bulky. However, prior to this I was using a compact dryer. Overall, great hair dryer that leaves your hair looking and feelings great!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer makes my hair soft and frizz free. Especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this one, it is great!!</li>
    <li> I received the Flash Blow Dryer to review for free and have no affiliation with Goody nor was I compensated for this review. Everything I write here is my own opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First impressions upon receiving this hair dryer are that it is a VERY attractive piece. The box is attractive with sections of matte and shiny surfaces. The dryer is attractive with its colour and twisted design. I like the slightly inset buttons as it makes gripping the handle easier on the hands but they aren&#x27;t so much so that you can&#x27;t still turn it on or off or higher/lower with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Having done hair for years I&#x27;ve used many hair dryers and this one has a great amount of functions on it. (I love that the hot isn&#x27;t scalding like most hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past)I love the little turbo boost button. All around probably one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve used personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Only major downside I really found was the size/shape. The shape of the dryer is what works in its favor for the air flow but I felt it was slightly heavy on the back end. Not so much it isn&#x27;t tolerable, but just enough to be annoying. The intake fan on the back is much larger than any I have ever seen on a hair dryer I have ever used, and with hair down to my waist I have to be extra cautious to not get my hair stuck in it. If you hold your hand to the back of the dryer while it is on it sucks your hand to it like a vacuum. That&#x27;s something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall I enjoyed this hair dryer though. I rarely use hair dryers but when I do the cool setting is great on this one to keep my hair feeling silky without damaging it, but I know since the hot isn&#x27;t too hot it would be okay for days when I am in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;*I have not tried the two attachment pieces as of yet that came with the dryer but when I need them its great to have them.*</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! It really does dry my hair faster without frizzing my hair or causing breakage. It is larger, but is not very heavy. I bought it because it was inexpensive but if it dies out or if I drop it and break it like my last one I will repurchase. Saves me so much time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, this was my first blow dryer, and I&#x27;m never going back. I now pity how I used to live without one.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed by how cheap this was, so I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. My post-initiation curiosity turned me on to more expensive units, so I now use the ghd Air, but for $200 less and identical features, I can&#x27;t imagine a better value.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try a new blow dryer due to the fact that my hair was constantly frizzy after drying and my dryer was at least  6 years old.  I ended up getting the Goody Heat Flash blow dryer and much to my surprise my hair dried super fast -- I have a good amount of fine hair -- and it was smooth and not at all frizzy.  No need to flat iron at all.  Also, it is not heavy and the angle of the blower is a help as well.  Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful, very nice, great speed, but also a great noise, do not mute, but the price is very like, very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This product was a steal!&lt;br /&gt;I love the design and its weight. It is although a bit bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I love the different temperatures and settings as well as the additional accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Its powerful and efficient, it dries my hair pretty well in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> This Goody&#x27;s Heat Flash Dry Blow Dryer replaced my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer which was getting a bit long in the tooth.  The first thing we noticed is just how large the Goody dryer is.  It is markedly heavier and larger than any hair dryer we&#x27;ve previously owned.  The size seems to improve the drying ability of the appliance.  More and hotter air was coming out and our hair was dry in a markedly shorter time than with previous hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly though, this comes at a price.  The odd set up of the dryer has the angle of the grip set at a 45 degree angle to the main motor, rather than the 90 degree angle of most such products.  This forces your grip into a strange position that makes the heavy machine harder to hold for long periods.  Furthermore, the grip is hard plastic with no rubberized spots.  So using it straight out of the shower makes it very slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a nice and powerful product.  However it does have a few major drawbacks which make it difficult to give an unfettered recommendation to.</li>
    <li> The Goody Heat Flash Dry Blow Dryer claims to dry hair 35% faster than the leading hairdryer. I personally didn&#x27;t find that it dried my hair any faster than my current blow dryer which sports the same 1875 watt strength. The Heat Flash Dry Blow Dryer does include a max speed button which does kick up the speed slightly, but seemed to make a barely noticeable difference. I didn&#x27;t really care for the placement of the max speed button. It&#x27;s hard to tell visually whether or not you have the button engaged. I had to push it on and off a few times to figure out whether I had actually turned the feature on (just goes to show that there&#x27;s not a significant difference between the max speed and the standard speed.)I also accidentally hit the cool shot button several times while I was drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is fairly lightweight it is also quite large and, in my opinion, slightly cumbersome to use. The concentrator and diffuser were nice additions, and the dryer did a relatively decent job in drying my hair smoothly, but I have to admit it&#x27;s probably not my favorite due to the size. The color is nice and stylistically it&#x27;s attractive, but I think my smaller, older dryer may outshine this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get the job done, but it&#x27;s not my #1 choice.</li>
    <li> TOO BIG FOR MY AND I DON&#x27;T RECEIVE THE RECIPE FOR THE ITEM, EVERY THING ELSE GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD</li>
    <li> I had this blow dryer before and my daughter took it with her when she went away to school.  I track this down and purchased two.  One for a back up.</li>
    <li> best hair dryer ever. this thing moves as much air as an electric leaf blower, not joking , when i unboxed it to test it, it launched the stuff on my desk everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer. Does the job. But the controls are not in the best spot to use, and it is quite heavy</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I had bad experience with this hair dryer. The first week, it fluttered from high to low speed on its own. The second week, the motor burned out and it stopped working all together. Disappointing and waste of money.</li>
    <li> This dryer seems to get my hair dry faster than any other.  I so far use heat only, not cool air.  The tip is different, but easy to get use to.</li>
    <li> amazing product that dry your hair fast</li>
    <li> I just went to use this product for the first time. I plugged it in, and pushed the reset/test buttons just like the instructions say to do. Then I tried to turn it on. Another reviewer noted how it is difficult to switch the buttons. Absolutely correct on that. They ARE a little difficult. But regardless, I turned the switch, and NOTHING happened. Tried doing the whole reset/test thing again. Nothing. Then I noticed a burning smell. The stupid thing wouldn&#x27;t even turn on, but had somehow managed to start smoking. It&#x27;ll be going back to the store tonight. Even though I&#x27;ve read many, many good reviews, I can&#x27;t help but be hesitant to purchase another one of these.</li>
    <li> Trying to pay it forward as I often depend upon reviews to make informed purchases (and yet rarely leave them myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--It does dry my hair faster than the Remmington hair dryer I previously had. I would say 35% is an accurate description. See cons...&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s a nice-looking hair dryer. But very large.&lt;br /&gt;--Unlike one reviewer, I did not find the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button very difficult to use-- and my hands/fingers were rather slippery from hair goop!&lt;br /&gt;--I like that it came with two different types of attachments-- one for straightening and one for diffusing. Most hair dryers come with one or the other but not both-- so I really appreciated that you could, theoretically, use this for different styles. Unfortunately, while I didn&#x27;t try the diffuser, the concentrater wasn&#x27;t effective and so this is rather a moot point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--I smelled something burning right away! Though it never smoked and didn&#x27;t feel especially hot, this fact concerned me right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;--Think about it-- 35% is not a high percentage. Yes it was faster, but not especially noteworthy.&lt;br /&gt;--Other reviews are correct-- this does not have much heat. Very luke-warm at \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting. Which means I couldn&#x27;t style my hair. If all you want is to dry your hair quickly-- fine. But I think most people buying hair dryers use them for more than just drying. I have a layered bob which I try to curl under while drying, but I couldn&#x27;t do so with this dryer. Switched to my old hair dryer to finish off.&lt;br /&gt;--Other reviews are also correct-- the \\&quot;concentrating\\&quot; attachment isn&#x27;t effective&lt;br /&gt;--It is bulky, though not especially heavy-- average for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now for my rambling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I am living abroad and needed a hair dryer to take with me. This is way too big to fit in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at TJMaxx for a bit more than Amazon sells it. I really would love to have the T3 but can&#x27;t justify spending that much $ (and reviews describing it self-combusting kind of concern me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the name of this hair dryer is misleading as it is not a HEAT flash dryer-- since it certainly does not blow hot air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these things considered, I think there are much better alternatives on the market. I intend to find one! It does dry hair-- but that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s like the track phone of cell phones-- and why buy a track phone when you can get an iPhone, or at least a blackberry?</li>
    <li> my favorite hair dryer NO freez and super fast</li>
    <li> Powerful. A little heavy.</li>
    <li> I wanted dryer with strong power. I can dry my hair quickly with this dryer. Price is reasonable. I am satisfied with this dryer.</li>
    <li> wonderful dryer ... best I have ever owned</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot it gives out the right amount of heat and not leaving the feeling of being over dried.  I have caused myself to have stressed hair due to over coloring and blow drier I did have just left my hair feeling like it was over dried so I decided to try a new blow drier.  I found this one on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price and to top it off it is an awesome blow drier.  I highly recommend this blow dryer, I&#x27;m 43 and have been threw many blow dryers and this is by far my favorite one!!</li>
    <li> this is my second one and they are both working excellent.</li>
    <li> I am truly disappointed, I opened the package and took out the box the hair dryer was in and there was a sticky substance on the box (not the amazon box but the actual product box). I thought it was someones drink that spilled at the distribution center so I began to clean the box with a damp towel with water. I then smelled a horrible smell of human urine. I actually touched this with my hands. I am disgusted as this is a gift for Christmas.  I would have liked to exchange but the option is not offered. I have to send the item back, wait for a credit and re order. The price is now different from last week, it has gone up.  When I spoke to Amazon they said this was my only option so I told them I would  contact the seller.  When I contacted the seller they told me to contact Amazon.  Ugh I am so disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird-lookng and has a giant intake fan, but it does a better job with more air and better temperature control than any other drer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a sister-in-law because her old one was crap. This dryer amazed her when she turned it on because it is so powerful. It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> Super high power airflow.</li>
    <li> I go through hair dryers quickly. Most of us with very long hair do. Although I&#x27;m being careful, a single strand gets sucked into the air intake and wraps something, slowing the fan which pushes the air. Either the hair burns through, in which case the dryer recovers, or it doesn&#x27;t and there goes another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve only gotten a strand of hair sucked in twice, and the dryer has recovered quickly and completely both times. My sole complaint about it is that as dryers go, it&#x27;s fairly large, making it easy to inadvertently hit things with the dryer or my arm when using it, until I learned, anyway.</li>
    <li> Goody Heat Flash - Fast, noisy and hard to turn on  This is a direct comparison of several hair dryers. A Conair, a Revlon and the Goody (see my other reviews for details on the others). Up front the big deal breaker for me. Take a look at my user image attached above. The power switch is recessed into the dryer handle and its surface is flush with the handle. If you have just come out of the shower and your hands are the slightest bit moist (towel dry, not wet), you will have a very difficult time sliding the switch to the on position. I had to use a fingernail or a towel. None of the other dryers have this issue, their switches have a comfortable knob style switch. If you can live with this the rest is not all that bad. The first impression is that this dryer is BIG. This is also a clue of how for the most part the claims that it dries faster are somewhat true. The diameter of the air intake is the largest of any hair dryer I have seen at about 3 ¼\\&quot;. The fan is huge, and consequently noisy (2-4 dBa louder than others). It also allows the fan to blow air at a faster velocity than any other dryer I have tried (26 mph vs 23 for the second fastest). The actual heat output/power consumption surprisingly is not the highest (as measured by the Kill a watt [[ASIN:B00009MDBU P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor]]) at 1520 watts, both the Conair and Revlon use more. So it appears that to achieve the claim of drying faster, the Goody uses faster air speed and slightly cooler air.  There is really no magic to fast drying, a lot of BTU&#x27;s to vaporize the  wetness and a rapid way of removing the moisture. In actual drying time tests, I wet a small area of a tissue and measured how long it took to dry it. The Goody was in a statistical tie with the Conair, and as much as 30% faster than the Revlon. The Revlon is the quietest and slowest air, but it does have the largest outlet nozzle, so it does not blow the hair around as much.  In summary, the Goody Heat Flash hair drier does dry fast by trading some heat for air speed and noise. The poor design of the power switch keeps the overall rating lower than what it may have been.  PS Untill add your own image is avilable for this product, take close look at the handle in the official product images to se what I mean about the power switch.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this blow dryer. I used to dread drying my hair in the morning because it took forever since I have long hair. This blow dryer gets it done so much faster and my hair always looks sleek and shiny!!!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer delivers! I had purchased this item at a local store and used the dryer for almost a year when I mistakenly bumped it against the wall and it stopped working. I looked all over for a replacement and finally went to Amazon and found this item at an amazingly low price. I received it in perfect condition and in less than a week. I would recommend this seller and this item. It dries your hair in half the time.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old blow dryer finally died.  I&#x27;m on fixed income so I needed something inexpensive, but I wanted an ionic hair dryer.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this one instead of the other brands.  My hair is almost waist length, and this little item dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  I also love like the ergonomic handle.  Worth it !</li>
    <li> Heavy and clunky with medium air output. Could have spend a few more $ and gotten something much better.</li>
    <li> I used to have such frizzy hair after I blow dried it and it would take me for ever to blow dry and to straighten after words, but it doesn&#x27;t and I love that about this blow drier and I have only used it once.</li>
    <li> For the first 2 months this blow dryer worked great then all of the sudden stopped blowing out hot/warm air...only cold air which was very frustrating. Not pleased with the product especially since I only had it for 2 months!</li>
    <li> Whatever complaints i might have about this are negated by the price paid vs performance.  My wife loves it.  It&#x27;s a bit large, and a bit noisy, but it works great, dries her hair in 1/2 the time, and is much cheaper here on amazon.</li>
    <li> it has no removable cover over the air intake so it just sucks up hair into the motor which makes the motor&lt;br /&gt;slow down and eventually burn out. this is a potentially dangerous situation since the motor could acctually&lt;br /&gt;catch fire. this dryer lasted only 2 months before it started to slow down a lot. just a few days beyond the&lt;br /&gt;returnable date.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer from the store. I thought it looked amazing! It came with 2 attachments and on the box it stated that it would dry your hair faster. I took it out and was like \\&quot;wow, kind of big, but ok\\&quot; then I tried my normal routine of roller brushing and drying my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that my arms are short or what, I just felt this hair dryer is just way to big. Then, it was taking forever to dry my hair. The high heat was not hot at all, and I ended up getting frustrated and used my little travel blow dryer, which sadly did better than this one. The design is way cool but the actual outcome was ridiculous. I returned it the next day.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, It is very powerful. This has more options than any I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my 20+ year old Conair.  Fantastic air flow for quick dry. The fan really puts out powerful air flow.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Dries hair super fast, is lightweight &amp; pretty quiet. Love the three speeds and temperatures. Plus the design is adorable. Good buy!</li>
    <li> This is for my wife and she is very happy with the performance. It has the power she wants.</li>
    <li> Product stopped working within a week. Highly disappointed and irritated.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer, I have long thick hair that typically takes about 20 minutes to dry.  This hair dryer has it dry in 7 minutes!</li>
    <li> It definitely heats up nicely, sometimes a little too nice.  The handle does get really warm if you have thick hair and take a while to blowdry your hair.  Its pretty big but powerful.</li>
    <li> A good product. It works perfect. Two speed(low, high) and three temperature(cool, warm, hot).Come along with smoothing concentrator and volumizing.diffuser.</li>
    <li> To understand my assessment of the Goody dryer:  I have straight, fine, but thick hair.  It is heavily highlighted.  The Goody does dry hair faster than my older 1865 Tourmaline Revlon, and past used Conair.  While it&#x27;s weight is heavier, it is more ergonomically designed...with weight focused in the head of the dryer and not the handle.  There is little or no stress on the wrist as it maneuvers drying the complete head of hair.  (BTW, I was pretty surprised at this myself!)  It dries hair smoothly and hair appears younger and less fly away.  After my blow drying is set a few minutes later, I lightly mist with spray and scrunch...natural and soft.  My dryer is in a beautiful red...a real perk me up in the a.m.  I love the dryer.  It performs well on all counts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically believe the hype in products like blow dryers, as I figure hot air is hot air.  I have hair a little longer than shoulder length and the front is layered.  I&#x27;ve always had straight, fine hair - but some of my hair has begun to lose its pigment and has become more coarse and wiry.  After using this blow dryer, my hair hung straighter and flatter - and seemed to have more shine.  It was like the fountain of youth for my hair, turning back time before my hair started on the progression toward gray hair!  My husband has more gray and difficulty controlling it, so he&#x27;s going to try it next to see if it might help in taming his hair a bit.  I believe it did dry my hair faster, but what was surprising to me was that the air seemed cooler than most blow dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past. I haven&#x27;t yet experimented with using the volumizer to see if I might be able to combine the taming of the wiry hair with styling to give a bit of lift at the top, but will try that next and report my findings.  My hair responded less to my attempt to slightly curl the ends with a round brush during the blow drying than it does with the [[ASIN:B000FFI228 Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer (Wine)]] that I&#x27;ve been using (a great but hefty blow dryer).  This is a surprisingly lightweight blow dryer for its size, which is approximately 9.5 inches from the base to the tip, handle approximately 5.5 inches long and a cord that&#x27;s about 67 inches in length.  Overall, a blow dryer that dries fast but not too hot.  Whether you&#x27;ll like this blow dryer may depend on what you&#x27;re looking for in styling results.  If my hair is any indication, you can reduce frizz, and your hair will be straighter, flatter and possibly more shiny after using it.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has the force to dry my hair quickly! I bought one for me and each of my kids.</li>
    <li> Love the looks.  Does dry fast and at least no more frizzy than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little on the long side.  Just takes some getting used to...so you don&#x27;t konk your head.</li>
    <li> Works great and very powerful.  Great value as well.  Been using it for 4 months without any issues.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer, well worth the $$$. I purchased a 2nd just so I can have a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is just ok.  The dryer is heavy and not weighted right.  This does NOT dry my hair any faster, just the opposite.  I would not buy this again.The on/off and heat buttons are very flat and hard to turn on/off.  Disappointed how non user friendly this dryer is.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this blow dryer!</li>
    <li> I saw a write up in a magazine about this dryer. Said it would cut your drying time in half. That it will do if you use it on full speed.  It has only 2 settings for speed and heat. Tends to make my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first but after about six months of using this dryer the heating element stopped working. I only used it about twice a week.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. I&#x27;ve been thinking of buying a new blow dryer since mine was over 12 years old but still working just fine. I saw the commercial for it, and it&#x27;s been stuck in my head to buy it for months now. Now my old blow dryer would dry my hair in about 7 minutes and it would feel frizzy. This one DRIES my hair in 3 minutes! It doesn&#x27;t feel frizzy it felt soft! This blow dryer is a bit heavy and I&#x27;m a little disapointed that it doesn&#x27;t fit in my bathroom drawer (too wide) but other than that will recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Loved everything about it! The blow dryer is very light, and it dries hair while making it shine. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I have super thick wirey hair that takes forever to dry. I can go from sopping wet to totally dry in 3 minutes with this thing. My first one only lasted about 8 months though, but the speed of drying makes up for that.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Love the power and that my hair now feels softer since it has more options that my original one. The force of wind is amazing also. I don&#x27;t think it is that heavy since the weight is distributed properly but the buttons are a little stiff to move.</li>
    <li> this is the one for you. i did not expect this to be as good as it is for the price. all i can say is try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer works well but the nozzle is at an awkward angle when drying. Most dryers are straight and this one angles down.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a christmas gift and it only last one year before it died.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 because the &amp;#34;muzzle&amp;#34; (which is not displayed on the picture) doesn&#x27;t rotate. It&#x27;s a good hair dryer, though. It is bigger than you&#x27;d expect. I would recommend it for its value (I bought it for $12).</li>
    <li> The hair dry is good in all, the color is beautiful. But it is a little too big and heavy, and should be smaller and lighter</li>
    <li> This thing is a BEAST.  It works really well and the attachments that come with it are nice.  It won&#x27;t fit in the drawers of our cabinets though and that&#x27;s a big draw back.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer does work a lot faster, as promised.  I only have one issue with it.  There is no cover for the back, and so my hair has gotten caught in the fan on the back a few times.  If you&#x27;ve got shorter hair, this would be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The handle gets very hot during use, and I don&#x27;t even have a lot of hair.  It&#x27;s a safety concern for me.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair, and at first this dryer worked really well at getting my hair dried much faster than my old hair dryer.  Then all of a sudden, it stopped blowing warm and hot air altogether.  I expect a hairdryer of this quality to last several years, not just one month.  Since I had liked it so much I threw out the box, and thus all hopes of returning it.  I have since returned to my old hairdryer, which I have had for several years, and while it takes longer to do my routine, I at least know that it won&#x27;t stop working.</li>
    <li> I had a hair dryer I liked but the \\&quot;concentrating\\&quot; piece always swiveled a little too easily and eventually wouldn&#x27;t stay locked on, so I was on the hunt for a new dryer when I was able to try this one. I have very thick wavy hair that I straighten so it usually takes me about 30 minutes. This one didn&#x27;t cut the time down any, but I ended up with a much better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The \\&quot;smoothing concentrator\\&quot; actually CLICKS into place so it&#x27;s not going to come out. (see Con #1.)&lt;br /&gt;2. It dries my really thick hair pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has a cool setting in addition to warm and hot.&lt;br /&gt;5. The \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button is in a convenient place.&lt;br /&gt;6. I wasn&#x27;t sweating by the time I finished, which I usually am with my old dryer. (See Con #3.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The \\&quot;smoothing concentrator\\&quot; actually CLICKS into place so you can&#x27;t aim it (something I was used to).&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;smoothing concentrator\\&quot; has air vents on the top and bottom which seem to let out a lot of heat/air which seems counterintuitive, so there must be some engineering at work there that I don&#x27;t understand. These vents cause your hair to blow around a bit as you&#x27;re drying.&lt;br /&gt;3. The hot setting didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I&#x27;ve had with other dryers, but it still dried better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this one!</li>
    <li> The large size and shape makes this dryer very awkward to use.  It is also difficult to turn on.  It didn&#x27;t get very hot.  It did dry my hair faster than my old dryer. Overall I do not recommend this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. Super speedy drying of hair.  I personally have no hair so it matters not to me.</li>
    <li> First saw this advertised on television.  Went to my local Target because I actually wanted to see the physical size and weight.  Paid significantly more at Target ($29.99).  Have had it for over 18 months and just recently was ready to replace it.  Came to Amazon and bought this one and the Remington one that claims to dry hair 50% faster.  Ended up giving the Remington (more expensive) to my sister and kept this one.  This will be my hair dryer for as long as Goody makes it.</li>
    <li> It dryed my daughters hair in nothing! Then I noticed the heat was not that hot, excellent because it would not damage the hair and at the same time because it dyes the hair fast you would not need the heat! It is perfect!</li>
    <li> I used this dryer for about a week before going back to my old one.  It is interesting that it definitely blows more air than other dryers, but I didn&#x27;t find the dry time to be significantly faster.  I timed my old dryer and this one under circumstances as close as I could duplicate and found maybe a 30 second difference. This may be because the dryer just doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  So at least for hair blown straight on high head, it&#x27;s not very helpful.  I did not try it doing my hair curly with the diffuser, which would use a low heat setting.  It might be much more useful if that is the main way you use your dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice that the barrel of the dryer does not get very hot, so it can be held there.  It was also nice to have the hanging loop, but ultimately the higher heat and the retractable cord on my old dryer moved me back to it.</li>
    <li> The product was light to handle and dried my hair vey fast with very little frizz, we bought it because we were visiting NY and needed a hair dryer, we were very sad it didn&#x27;t fit in our suitcases to bring it home!!!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer it still works and I&#x27;ve had it forever. It&#x27;s sleek and compact while also packing a quick dry into a small weightless device!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the price!  Makes a great gift!  Wish I had found sooner!  Works great on thick hair! Buy one!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has cut the time it takes to dry my long hair way down. The buttons are fine. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very attractive, which is what caught my eye and It&#x27;s powerful, as advertised, but it&#x27;s larger than I would have liked.  Also, it&#x27;s the heaviest dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer, fast drying and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> My hair dries very quickly with this blow dryer, within 3 minutes.  You have to be careful that your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the back end, it&#x27;s happened twice.  Just switch it off and very gently remove your hair.  If hair get&#x27;s stuck the blow dryer will lose blowing power, unplug it and get a thin sharp tool like a tooth cleaner that the dentist uses and get the hair out.  Then the blow dryer will work like new!</li>
    <li> when i first recieved this product it was great but after only one week of use i can now only get a low setting, the high setting does not work, i would Not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was great for a few weeks then blew out...</li>
    <li> This thing could hold off a tornado, but if you have a ton of hair, it&#x27;s just the ticket!</li>
    <li> Such a powerful hair dryer and really not so heavy. Feels like you&#x27;re drying your hair with a turbo jet. If you like to blow dry fast, this is one for you. Have had it for a year now and works great.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and it usually takes forever to dry. I timed how long it would take to dry using this one and total was 10 min. With my previous ones it would take 20+ minutes. Now I can get my hair done in a hurry. It is larger then normal ones and doesn&#x27;t get too hot but obviously works great. Not bright red but still a pretty color. Then again, I didn&#x27;t buy it for the color!</li>
    <li> MY girlfriend tried it at a friend&#x27;s house and swears it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever had. So I bought her one as a surprise (I got quite a reward for just $20).</li>
    <li> Would like to send back</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair dryer because mine was terrible- and I am extremely happy with it. I have very thick hair, which at the moment is just past my shoulders, and it dries my hair fully in just under four minutes! Other dryers would never fully dry my hair, so I&#x27;m pretty much amazed that this one does. Doesn&#x27;t overheat, and I mostly use the highest two settings. It looks kind of bulky, but it&#x27;s very light weight and easy to maneuver. I don&#x27;t use the attachments, so I don&#x27;t know how well those work, but the dryer on it&#x27;s own is enough for me!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer does a nice job of getting my hair dry and sleek. One thing to note is that it&#x27;s a bit oversized, so it can feel a bit hard to hang on to when you&#x27;re switching up your hair sections and round brush. I don&#x27;t know that it really dries my hair any faster than my old hairdryer, but it was a great value.</li>
    <li> It works perfect. Two speed(low, high) and three temperature(cool, warm, hot).Come along with smoothing concentrator and volumizing.diffuser. It is made in China(which the country I come from), but the same product in China will be more expensive than this one. I will recommend it to those who have long hair. It will dry hair less time.</li>
    <li> This dryer works well.  Dries faster than my old one.  The price is right. It is heavier than my old one.  The weight is no problem</li>
    <li> Dries hair fast without any hassle. Hair dryer is a bit heavy but faster drying time is great! Fast delivery. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had a hair dryer that was fairly new and after using it for a while I noticed my hair was looking and feeling dry and frizzy.  When I dried my hair it would get very hot and I felt like my hair was frying.  It probably was.  This dryer is much bigger, and way better than I could have imagined.  My hair never gets ultra hot and it feels soft and healthy after drying.  The frizzed and dry look of my hair started to fade after just a couple of uses.  It is bigger and felt a bit cumbersome at first, but once I got used to it I realized that I liked the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone who uses a dryer on a regular basis.  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for 7 months and I love it. Just as good as my friends high end hair dryers. I have super thick hair and this dries it quickly without frying it. I love all the settings.</li>
    <li> I really, really love this hair dryer.  I&#x27;d let my hair air-dry for years, but I got a Groupon for this dryer and decided to snag it.  And I use it every night now, because it&#x27;s so fast (and pretty).  Also it&#x27;s really well weighted -- my hand never gets tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the power switch issues other have mentioned -- it&#x27;s not THAT big of a deal.  Yeah, it could be easier, but I don&#x27;t have to use a towel or my fingernail, I just have to grip it with both hands to slide the switch.  I barely notice it.</li>
    <li> I used my sister-in-laws while visiting family and I was in awe!! I could not wait to order mine. Best of all it was 5 dollars cheaper than she paid. I hate blow drying my hair because I always get to hot and start sweating (leaving me with oily hair in hours). Yes it is a bit heavy but in the right places by that I mean it is very easy to hold. As fast as it blows of course it will be loud and yes it does smell a bit at first because it is new just like turning on a new oven or new curling iron. Nothing to bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I LOVE IT and would have payed full price for it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is heavier than you might expect, but it&#x27;s fast drying and the fan area is more than twice the size of the nozzle, so you know it&#x27;s maximizing input to output of air.  Love this hair dryer.  It sits on its end, but also has the hook to hang it on the wall/cupboard.</li>
    <li> After my blow dryer blew up, I figured I would go on amazon and order whatever. Didn&#x27;t really put much thought into what I was going to buy until I saw THIS one on SUPER sale and it had tons of good reviews. Sooo, after reading through the reviews, I bought this for 15 bucks and it was here in two days. This dryer was so good I didn&#x27;t even need to use my flat iron, which was brand new and arrived the same day. It is a bit big, But it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It has three settings for both strength and temp&#x27;s, which allows my daughter to use it with out complaining. The buttons are a little large, so I could see some people not liking this and saying they&#x27;re annoying, this really just takes some getting used to, just like a new phone.  I would pay full price for this blow dryer and not bat an eye. Buy it!</li>
