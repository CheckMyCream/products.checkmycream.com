<li> If showering after, alternate cold for 30 seconds followed by hot for up to five minutes (sequence is repeated three times: hot bath, cold 30 seconds, hot shower</li>
<li> The left over salt is going to be used for me to soak my tired, old feet after all of that wedding organizing, decorating and planning.</li>
<li> Alternatively, a hot and cold sitz bath works, wherein you sit in a bucket of ice cold water alternated with the hot bath in the same time format.</li>
<li> The only negative is that its a tad pricey.</li>
<li> I help keep the swelling and water weight down.</li>
<li> do this twice a day: I slip in upon awakening to ease me into the day, and again 90 minutes before bed to begin winding down.</li>
<li> My little grubby boys get their feet soaked in this stuff</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great, if you live in apartment and have hard water. Can really feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Use this on my garden vegetables &amp; flowers, it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
    <li> Awesome buy and will be purchasing again.  It was a great deal and I&#x27;m still trying to get through my bags which I purchased all of the beginning of last year.</li>
    <li> We bought the Epsoak epsom salt to use as a filler for my daughter&#x27;s wedding reception table arrangements.  The arrangements were in a tall, clear vase with gorgeous deep red silk hydrangeas and black feather and twinkle filler.  The salts were poured into the vase and the stems were arranged in them.  The epsom salt looked just like sparkling snow which was the effect we were going for.  The left over salt is going to be used for me to soak my tired, old feet after all of that wedding organizing, decorating and planning.</li>
    <li> I am pretty abusive to my body working out and need to avoid DOMS and other muscle soreness - I go through these bags like water. It&#x27;s great to have the bulk bag. This is unscented and dissolves like a charm. HIghly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the detox bath. Epsom salt,a small amount of baking soda, hot water, and soak soak soak. This stuff is perfect. Because it&#x27;s in bulk I save a lot of money and I just love the quality of the product. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Great grain size and wonderful for many baths. Purchased many times and very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Nice product as described</li>
    <li> This is a product that is used within my home regularly. I also use to make gifts at Christmas time. I might likely reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> I use Epsom salt for a number of things - garden, lawn and more.  The smaller packages just don&#x27;t last long enough.  To get it in larger quantities is very helpful.  The last order had a minor shipping problem, which after one email was promptly and courteously  fixed.  Recommended product, recommended vendor.</li>
    <li> My only problem is that I love my epsom salt detox baths so much that I&#x27;ll go through 40 lbs relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated receiving a sample of fancy grey salt with the delivery. The laminated rating reminder card, however, frustrated me because I was unable to recycle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this company to friends based on the price, speedy delivery, service, and quality of the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipe for use as a detoxification bath:&lt;br /&gt;Ensure that you will not be disturbed during your bath time if you don&#x27;t want to be. Protect your personal time by telling kids or others who may intrude that you need the time (20 or more minutes) to yourself, and only to interrupt you in the case of an emergency. Peace of mind that your space is safe and secure will improve your experience.&lt;br /&gt;Shower beforehand if need for soap cleansing so that you can leave the bath without rinsing off. Clean face with coconut oil (removes makeup better than soap does, and does not dry out the skin like soap can) on a washcloth or cotton ball/pad.&lt;br /&gt;Fill tub with water as hot as possible. Water will cool off quickly, or you can add cold water later.&lt;br /&gt;Add in 1 cup of epsom salt as water is filling (more if you want, build up gradually to become accustomed to more intense baths).&lt;br /&gt;Optionally, add 6-12 drops of your aromatherapeutic essential oil of choice (eucalyptus, white fir, other awakening scents in the am; lavender, ylang ylang, chamomile, other calming scents in the evening).&lt;br /&gt;Optionally, add EITHER apple cider vinegar (to soothe skin) or baking soda (to relieve inflammation) (1/2 c. of either). Be advised that baking soda used in excess (volume or frequency) can affect the internal pH for women and cause abnormal discharge, yeast growth, and other problems.&lt;br /&gt;Before entering the bath, use a dry skin brush to scrub the skin gently, brushing in small clockwise circles starting from the tips of the extremities and moving in towards the heart.Do not scrub the face.&lt;br /&gt;Stay in the bath for around 20 minutes, or however long it is comfortable. Set a timer if you are unable to tell when you feel done. Epsom salt baths work osmotically to remove toxins, so excessively long baths run the risk of dehydrating the bather. Be sure to hydrate before, during and after the bath. Some explanations say that the toxins will flow back from the water into the bather, a claim that I have not taken the time to consider extensively. Do not use soap when using essential oils, as they will interact on the skin and cause a burning sensation. If this happens, rinse off and leave the bath.&lt;br /&gt;When in the bath, if trying to detoxify the skin on the face, submerge all of the face but the nose and mouth, or submerge either the lower half or upper half of the face while placing a warm wet washcloth on the other half. You can alternate or focus on just one portion. Clean the face by lightly scrubbing with the washcloth (terry cloth works well).&lt;br /&gt;During the bath, meditate or watch the breath by doing box breaths (belly breath in count 4, hold lightly 4, belly breath all the way out 4, hold lightly 4, repeat), or however you like to relax. Pelvic floor exercises (Wild Feminine by Tami Kent) are also great to do in the bath and help to connect with the self and the day.&lt;br /&gt;When leaving the bath, sit and stand up slowly. If showering after, alternate cold for 30 seconds followed by hot for up to five minutes (sequence is repeated three times: hot bath, cold 30 seconds, hot shower 5 min, cold 30 sec, hot 5 min, cold 30 sec (end on cold)) to increase blood circulation and help to wake up. Alternatively, a hot and cold sitz bath works, wherein you sit in a bucket of ice cold water alternated with the hot bath in the same time format. Ending on cold water allows the pores to close.&lt;br /&gt;When exited, pat the body and face dry with a clean towel. The magnesium sulfate that comprises epsom salt softens the skin, so leave it on if youcan. The essential oils will leave you smelling naturally lovely. Apply rosemary hair oil (a few drops) or your natural wet hair treatment of choice, or simply towel dry. Mist toner (witch hazel or other clean, non-alcohol, salicylic acid-containing astringent) on the face and neck or onto a cotton ball and lightly spread over the skin using the applicator or your clean fingers. While still wet, apply a clean moisturizer (coconut oil, etc.). The toner aids absorption of the moisturizer by the skin. Remember to hydrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this twice a day: I slip in upon awakening to ease me into the day, and again 90 minutes before bed to begin winding down. Hot baths closer to my sleep time disturb my night&#x27;s sleep, but some people swear by their bath immediately before bed. Under the supervision of my naturopath and health coach, I am on a detox diet (SCD/FODMAPS) and my organs are detoxing through my skin and am therefore trying to optimize detoxification. I have not seen more than two epsom salt baths per day recommended. Less frequent is still useful and also less time consuming. If you do not have a bath, use a foot tub to detox through your feet, where toxins also tend to collect. I have found that my skin symptoms have actually increased as I have been using detox strategies. This is a sign that the detox is working and not cause for alarm. My skin rash/acne on my face, neck, chest and back has persisted for several months as I make progress in other areas with my stress level, diet, lifestyle, etc. My improved quality of life has been worth the transitional symptoms. Importantly, I am in frequent contact with my health practitioners, and would not undertake this program without getting checked out first and keeping them updated on my progress and changes I make.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Soaking</li>
    <li> I love this salt I use it alot to lay in the tub for my arthritis and pain in my joints and it helps alot!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 40-pound quantity. The manufacturer provides a fine grain of salt that dissolves well in very warm to mildly hot bath water. The product is contained within a durable zippered plastic bag and is reasonably priced. Don&#x27;t expect one 40-pound bag. This shipped in two 20-pound bags which makes it much easier to handle. I was also impressed by the very quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised that I receive two bags of it. I use it every week. Mostly for skin and for Detoxing. This is definitely worth the amount I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for me. I use this stuff about 2-3 times weekly. I help keep the swelling and water weight down.</li>
    <li> Item shipped quickly.  We put a couple of handfuls in our bathwater several times a week.  Not sure they sell scented salts, but lavendar would be lovely.  Bag is heavy duty and tear resistant.</li>
    <li> Came well packaged  and promptly. Always satisfied with their product and service.This is a substantial savings ove the four lb. packages you find in the chain drug stores.</li>
    <li> Fabulous quality, great price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely adore! Second time ordering and ordered more this time. Love the bulk price! Comes quickly and I take a lot of baths and use this 2-3 times a week sometimes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding Epsom salts in bulk and was glad to discover these.  I like the resealable zip on the package and the quality of the bag itself - makes it easy to store and use the salts without worrying about the bag busting open.</li>
    <li> Forty pounds of heaven. A glass of wine and a soak in the tub with this Epsom salt is just what the doctored order. Vacuum sealed for freshness and easier storage, it dissolves and leaves your relaxed. No lavender, no extras just a quality salt for those tired bones.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a year ago and I still have enough left for another month.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, well packed, reasonable price. For using as a foot soak or bath additive, this makes much more sense than buying 1 lb. packages.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, as expected.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived as pictured and in (2) 20lb bags.  Dissolves nicely and serves its intended purpose of providing a muscle soak after workouts.</li>
    <li> Excellent base product with effective packaging; the bag seal remained tight for the 4 months it took for me to use this .  Shipped in a manageable format.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to bathe in.  Never take baths... But, thought it might help my weird rash (on stomach).  It didn&#x27;t help my rash (though, it&#x27;s gone now... Thank God).  Maybe, it did... Hmmm!  It&#x27;s so hard to write about Epsom Salt. My grandmother used to swear by its&#x27; healing, soothing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for whatever it does... Ordered it, Received it,.. All is good!  Have 20 pounds left over.  :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this to make homemade bath bombs and such. I love it&#x27;s texture as it&#x27;s not large, hard, and grainy like many I&#x27;ve used before. It has a very soft, soothing texture to it and melts away easily in the bath. My little grubby boys get their feet soaked in this stuff and they love it as well. It feels like a nice piece of serenity in the day</li>
    <li> Super company and product.  I use this for a variety of purposes and am very happy to find this option for buying bulk salt!</li>
    <li> great for the hot tub</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I have found in a while on epson Salt. Much cheaper that what you can buy at a store. The quality of the salt is excellent and the delivery was quick. No complaints. Got a great deal</li>
    <li> our soil needs epson salt.  we put it on all the bushes, trees, grass, grapes, raspberries, flowers etc  it really seems to help</li>
    <li> If you take hot baths to relieve muscle and joint pain this stuff is for you. Ive always believed in epsom salt baths and this stuff delivers. The only negative is that its a tad pricey. You may be able to get better deals locally.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Granted that the benefits of epsom salts are awesome (I use in baths), this product gets you everything you need at a great price - bulk rocks and much better than buying at local prices. Packaging great, shipping quick, and I&#x27;m very pleased. Also, customer service has been wonderful, promptly replacing a lost package.</li>
