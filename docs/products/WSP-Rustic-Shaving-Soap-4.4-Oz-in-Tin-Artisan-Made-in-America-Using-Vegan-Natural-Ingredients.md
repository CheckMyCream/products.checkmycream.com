      <li>What more could you ask for in a shave soap?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more soaps from WSP.</li>
      <li>Of the 5, Spring Rain and Mahogany were the most &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I also have the SandalRose and Spring Rain scents and they are both fantastic as well!  </li>
      <li>so I bought 3 more to stock up.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and the lather.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>and i am glad that i did.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>There are some interesting sounding options in the product line.</li>
      <li>I recently bought this soap and Best Pre-Shave Oil, Uncented, and the combination of both has resulted in the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>The smell reminds me of pipe tobacco, but I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I bought it before.</li>
      <li>And on top of that, my wife loves the scent.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>For the price you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
      <li>Simply the best.</li>
      <li>and it makes a nice rich and lubricating lather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to lather, and the smell is enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>Both had strong scents out of the sample tin, but seemed to mellow out when applied as cream (or more used to scent).  </li>
      <li>The most comfortable shave soap I have found.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a great shave soap with enjoyable scents, then I think you should definitely consider the WSP line.  </li>
      <li>The smell caught me as quite strong at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it more and more with time.</li>
      <li>hopefully It will be fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
      <li>I started with Mahogany and liked it so much that I ordered the Tobacco and Marrakech scents as well.  </li>
      <li>The scents are GREAT (especially Mahogany).  </li>
      <li>Post shave is as smooth as any I&#x27;ve had except for maybe Calla.</li>
      <li>Great soap that builds a terrific lather.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I read several good reviews and looked up videos about this shave soap.</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying again if your looking for a good starting bang for buck.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>I too have tried a number of different shaving soaps but WSP is something nice.</li>
      <li>Good solid layer, not a thin one as we&#x27;ve all seen if you&#x27;ve been using these awhile.</li>
      <li>It is at least on par with Cella, performance-wise, though the WSP soap&#x27;s scent is more appealing, and it&#x27;s better than the workhorse Arko in every way except price.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use with my badger hair brush and protects my sensitive skin very well.</li>
      <li>Love this soap it has a great smell only down side</li>
      <li>Better than store shelf brand, this stuff smells great and should last for quite a few months of shaving.</li>
      <li>Better by far than the quite serviceable Proraso green because of its superior scent, protective qualities, and post-shave feel.</li>
      <li>I like this soap very much.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite soap at present.  </li>
      <li>It smells and does exactly as the description says.</li>
      <li>Definitely not purchasing any more.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;d say that this a great shaving soap that is on par with other artisan shaving soaps and is, at this price point, worth giving a try.</li>
      <li>This soap is extremely easy to lather up; I only need 3-4 swirls with my boar bristle brush and I have plenty of soap.  </li>
      <li>I would say the ease of use of pretty high with these soaps.</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy to lather, the lather is thick and slick and gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>I really like the Mahogany scent.</li>
      <li>The soap dries your face out, it makes the razor skip on your face while making a normal pass.</li>
      <li>Solid white across the face, easy to lather and doesn&#x27;t go soft on the face, it stays where you put it</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Wow it raised 5 dollars in price!</li>
      <li>I did not think my skin was that sensitive, but I suppose stumbling upon a sensitivity is part of experimentation.  </li>
      <li>The soap sticks to the brush and doesn&#x27;t rinse out and strips your brush of its natural oils.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 of their scents and so far I like them all.</li>
      <li>Black Amber and Mahogany scents were a bit too strong for me, but I can definitely see why people like them.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t make more than one pass if you don&#x27;t have a ridiculous amount of lather.</li>
      <li>The scent will definitely linger for a few hours, but lightly and not in an overpowering way.  </li>
      <li>When shaving with it I find that it provides adequate protection though maybe less than other soaps with animal product.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the soap is used up a little fast for the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good soap but I am not fond of the scent.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. I love the scent. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the soap is used up a little fast for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the lather. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great soap that builds a terrific lather. The smell reminds me of pipe tobacco, but I love it. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soaps from WSP.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I read several good reviews and looked up videos about this shave soap. This soap SUCKS!!!!! It fails at everything that the reviews praise it for. The soap makes a thick sticky lather no matter how much water you add. If you have a nice badger brush it messes that up too! The soap sticks to the brush and doesn&#x27;t rinse out and strips your brush of its natural oils. This soap leaves a white chalky film on your razor and sink. Now on to how it does on your face, the soap is slimy but doesn&#x27;t glide it makes the hair on your face stick to your face and the razor goes over it with out cutting it. You can&#x27;t make more than one pass if you don&#x27;t have a ridiculous amount of lather. The soap dries your face out, it makes the razor skip on your face while making a normal pass. I have gave this soap several shaves thinking it was me with how I was loading the brush or amount of water, but nope this soap is horrible and the sent goes away the second your done shaving.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap... Probably the best I&#x27;ve tried. The smell caught me as quite strong at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it more and more with time. I&#x27;m definitely going to get some of the other scents, too... There are some interesting sounding options in the product line.</li>
    <li> This is perfect shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;But they keep raising the price.  Definitely not purchasing any more.</li>
    <li> I like this soap very much. For the price you can&#x27;t do better. I really like the Mahogany scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this soap.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to lather, and the smell is enjoyable.  The package arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition.  The smell of this soap has hints of cinnamon, vanilla, spices and earthy notes.  The scent will definitely linger for a few hours, but lightly and not in an overpowering way.  When shaving with it I find that it provides adequate protection though maybe less than other soaps with animal product.  Overall I&#x27;d say that this a great shaving soap that is on par with other artisan shaving soaps and is, at this price point, worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> This is a shaving soap that calls for superlatives. It puts out a perfect lather, with unrivaled slickness, and a decadently luxurious scent (I&#x27;ve tried Mahogany and Blackbeard.) Better by far than the quite serviceable Proraso green because of its superior scent, protective qualities, and post-shave feel. It is at least on par with Cella, performance-wise, though the WSP soap&#x27;s scent is more appealing, and it&#x27;s better than the workhorse Arko in every way except price. Definitely give this soap a try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time trying to achieve a quality larger with this soap.  The scent just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Just got the Mahogany in today, awesome scent, awesome lather, extremely slick and moisturizing, what&#x27;s not to like !&lt;br /&gt;As the others have said, buy this soap, you will be glad you did !!!</li>
    <li> sent is amazing and leathers up and protects great! Don&#x27;t hesitate buy</li>
    <li> Great product. Better than store shelf brand, this stuff smells great and should last for quite a few months of shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 of their scents and so far I like them all. Lathers great and smells great too. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It smells and does exactly as the description says. I like the feel of it. You can always feel shaving cream on your face but this one feels as if it was made to foot your face. Good solid layer, not a thin one as we&#x27;ve all seen if you&#x27;ve been using these awhile. I would recommend buying again if your looking for a good starting bang for buck. Solid white across the face, easy to lather and doesn&#x27;t go soft on the face, it stays where you put it</li>
    <li> The most comfortable shave soap I have found. Simply the best.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this soap and Best Pre-Shave Oil, Uncented, and the combination of both has resulted in the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. And on top of that, my wife loves the scent. I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap at present.  i like the smell and it makes a nice rich and lubricating lather.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap to see what it was like and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I started with Mahogany and liked it so much that I ordered the Tobacco and Marrakech scents as well.  This soap is extremely easy to lather up; I only need 3-4 swirls with my boar bristle brush and I have plenty of soap.  I make 4 passes at night and don&#x27;t have to reload my brush.  The soap is thick and lubricates your face well.  The scents are GREAT (especially Mahogany).  I too have tried a number of different shaving soaps but WSP is something nice. For the price, this is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap for a good price, I&#x27;ve tried slot of artisan soaps such as Catie&#x27;s Bubbles, Razorock, Strop Shoppe, etc and this one is as good as any. Great lather and slickness. Post shave is as smooth as any I&#x27;ve had except for maybe Calla. I also have the SandalRose and Spring Rain scents and they are both fantastic as well!  Do yourself a favor and get some of this stuff</li>
    <li> This soap performs well and smells incredible.  Unfortunately for me there is something in the ingredients that I am sensitive to, so I can&#x27;t use it.  This is not the fault of the soap, and I would recommend it to anyone.  The smell is truly incredible.  Its killing me not to be able to use it.  I did not think my skin was that sensitive, but I suppose stumbling upon a sensitivity is part of experimentation.  I will be trying another scent of this soap when I find someone to sell or trade this with.  hopefully It will be fine.  I will update.</li>
    <li> I think this soaps performs great, and I like the scent quite a bit.  WSP makes good products all around as I also have two of his aftershaves that I quite enjoy.  If you are looking for a great shave soap with enjoyable scents, then I think you should definitely consider the WSP line.  I would say the ease of use of pretty high with these soaps.</li>
    <li> Wow! I decided to try this soap and i am glad that i did. It is quick and easy to lather, the lather is thick and slick and gives a great shave. I bought the Mahogany and it smells great. A great soap all around.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers well. Only six ingredients. What more could you ask for in a shave soap?</li>
    <li> Wow it raised 5 dollars in price! So glad I bought it before.</li>
    <li> Love this soap it has a great smell only down side is it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tin to put in to your shaving cup. Other than that it&#x27;s great I&#x27;ll be ordering it agin</li>
    <li> The smell is a fresh/spicy scent, masculine, perfect  for an evening  date or night out and about.  It is very easy to use with my badger hair brush and protects my sensitive skin very well. A little  goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. Very nice product. Read where it might be discontinued so I bought 3 more to stock up.</li>
    <li> I purchased samples of Barbershop, Mahogany and Black Amber Vannile, received Marrakesh as a gift, and purchased Spring Rain blindly.  Thought the Barbershop scent would have been stronger.  Black Amber and Mahogany scents were a bit too strong for me, but I can definitely see why people like them.  Of the two, I prefer the Mahogany.  Both had strong scents out of the sample tin, but seemed to mellow out when applied as cream (or more used to scent).  Received compliments on Mahogany.  I&#x27;ll definitely use the samples but my personal preference is for lighter / brighter Spring Rain and Marrakesh.  Of the 5, Spring Rain and Mahogany were the most &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34;.  When needed (I&#x27;m set for awhile...), would not hesitate to buy again.  Nice products.  Good service.  5 stars.  Will probably buy some other samples.</li>
