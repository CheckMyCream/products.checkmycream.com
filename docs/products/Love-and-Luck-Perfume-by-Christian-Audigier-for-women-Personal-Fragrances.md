<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One of my favorite fragrances. It is reminiscent of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue, but Love &amp; Luck lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t have the powdery dry down Light Blue has. I used to buy this at Walmart, but they no longer sell it and will be buying on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had the same experience, but I have noticed a difference in the smaller bottle v. the larger bottle: for some reason, the larger bottle is not as strong and does not smell quite the same as the smaller bottle. If you are looking for a clean, uncomplicated fragrance for summer, this is the one. I guarantee you&#x27;ll get compliments.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. Exactly the same as what I could get at a department store (same scent and look), much cheaper. Packaging was appropriate, no breaks or spills. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.....but was having trouble finding it anymore in the stores. So went on Amazon and was happy to find it for a wonderful price!!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for xmas she loves it</li>
    <li> I absolutely look this perfume. This is my fourth bottle. Would recommend this perfume. Great for everyday or a nice nite out.</li>
    <li> I love this spicy scent. Much cheaper than buying at retail store.</li>
    <li> My sister got me into this perfume. It&#x27;s very exotic smelling....great for bold personalities.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this stuff and can no longer find it in stores. it&#x27;s beyond me why they take a great product off the shelf.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever. Every time I wear I get compliments</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and the price is excellent!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume not a big fan of female perfume but I do love this one</li>
    <li> I blindly ordered this not knowing what it smelled like. I had read the notes in it and figured I would give it a shot. Happy I did! At first I wasn&#x27;t NOT a fan, but I was convinced yet. After wearing it around for an hour or two I really loved how it smells. I&#x27;m halfway through the workday now and can still smell it. Kind of has a &#x27;hippy&#x27; smell to it with the patchouli but it&#x27;s not overpowering!! Great blind purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a very great smelling product I enjoyed it very much, maybe a little too much, I almost need more!</li>
    <li> Good buy fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love it!! Smells so good. I get so many compliments when I wear it. Thank you😊</li>
    <li> Perfume is great - lasts through the day.  Transaction was ordinary.  Didn&#x27;t come fast, came in time specified.  Not sure of how it was packaged, it was a gift to my MIL.  I have used this perfume for a few years now and LOVE it, she really liked it so bought her some. Good price!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  And it&#x27;s such a great deal on here.  The cheapest I could find it in stores was $35 for 1 oz, so paying $39 for 3 oz is awesome :)</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a dude and totally wear this perfume because women love it. They pull me in by my scarf and sniff my neck. Score.</li>
    <li> I cannot begin to express how happy I am to get my hands on this scent again!! I recently finished off the bottle I purchased at Macys years ago and was sad to find out it was no longer being carried. Took me this long to use the last of it up because I didnt want to run out lol. This has to be one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve ever had!!! The scent is soft, feminine, clean and sexy all in one - my everyday go to scent! Many compliments whenever I wear it and now I have a brand new full bottle to indulge in! This is def a must have perfume ladies :) great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It was here just when they said, kept track on the site and it worked out great! Loved it! Just can&#x27;t complain! I will order there again for sure!</li>
    <li> I received a broken bottle I contacted Amazon but whatever. The scent was strong and sweet. I wish someone contacted me back but perfume was okay.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, as it&#x27;s the most complimented one that i wear! i found this product to be 100% legit.  Wish the scent lasted a bit longer but this 3.4 oz size is big and should last me quite a while!! so thankful i found this on amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom it&#x27;s hugeeee and she loves it&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Light scent,  tons of compliments,  &amp; i don&#x27;t get a headache like I do with most fragrances</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes to wear. It is light, smell fresh with an exotic edge. One of my scents to never fail me regardless of the situation or event I attend.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Definitely not too over bearing, and I get a lot a good compliments on it! Very many people ask me what perfume it is. The best one is definitely the pink one, but this one is really good too. To me it has a citrus/tangy-type scent to it. It&#x27;s not totally floral, but I love it. 5 stars especially bcs I got it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just wondering how in the heck stores like Macy&#x27;s can get away with selling this almost&lt;br /&gt;double the price, same perfume and same sexy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift from me too me and love how it does not over power you once applied.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this perfume and then I found it on here for the fraction of the cost that I find it (if I find it) at local stores.</li>
    <li> I strongly think that this was a nicely packaged knock off of the real fragrance didnt smell the same :-(</li>
    <li> The seller was great.  I received the product very fast.  Its just not my scent.  I will wear it but it is definitely not my first choice.  This to me is more of an older woman scent.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells sooooo good but beware of buying it too cheap.  I bought the largest bottle for $23 and it ended up being no good.  It was either old or fake.  It smelled a bit sour and after about 20 minutes, the smell on my wrist (where I sprayed it) was completely gone.  Weird.  I ended up buying a different bottle from someone else.  It&#x27;s worth it to pay a little more.</li>
    <li> I love &amp;#34;Love &amp; Luck&amp;#34; !!! Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> After receiving a bottle of this perfume for Christmas, I decided to order some as Valentine gifts.  Time to order again, as mine is almost gone!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume smells great good for spring</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> After looking all over, I was very  happy to find that Amazon had this product!!  I had a sample and had used it up, so now I have a nice big bottle and LOVE the fragrance.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original ...ver light and soft ...doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I always love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s a nice fresh scent that is not overpowering as some perfumes can be.</li>
    <li> For the price, 100 ml of this great smelling perfume is a steal. Other customers who wrote that they thought it was fake are mistaken-- the writing on the bottle is Japanese (and not Chinese) and is simply the name of the maker &amp;#34;Ed Hardy.&amp;#34; Best to consult educated individuals about this kind of thing before making assumptions. According to my nose and my loved one&#x27;s nose, it smells exactly the same as the one I bought at the retail store. The product seems authentic and has authentic product numbers and manufacturing numbers on it. The price feels too good to be true, yes, but it simply is not fake. Retail stores sell many things for far too much, when on Amazon we can enjoy wholesale prices much more often.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume, it is warm yet edgy &amp; the scent sticks with you all day which is great! As soon as this bottle is gone I will definitely be ordering another :)</li>
    <li> Smells great and is most definitely the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found for this perfume.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this perfume. I go through it so quickly and get compliments all of the time.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite scents!</li>
    <li> Its okay. A weird mix between kenzo flowers and light blue.</li>
    <li> I have received so many compliments while wearing Ed Hardy&#x27;s Love &amp; Luck Perfume, that it&#x27;s now the only one I wear.  Unfortunately, I no longer see it being sold at Macy&#x27;s or other major department stores, and thus far have only been able to purchase it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it if your looking for a perfume that&#x27;s not over-bearing and too sweet and can be worn everyday...I love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite right now along with Chloe.  It is slightly floral and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is finding a consistency with the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve bought these at several places and it seemed like the smell was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also test it out at different stores, and the smell is different from the first bottle I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can find one that is true to the smell, then I am in love!</li>
    <li> Not for me - smell had no depth or durability.</li>
    <li> Fresh and invigorating scent. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and was not disappointed when it arrived.  It did take quite some time to get delivered but wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
    <li> I love that I found that size at such a reasonable price, and the delivery was quick and I had a choice not to pay for fast delivery, but the delivery was fast enough! It was my birthday so It was a great present to myself;-)</li>
    <li> Smells like fabulouso cleaner</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne is Burberry Brit and this smells like a lighter sweeter version without being too sweet. I wear it for my day to day perfume.</li>
    <li> love this perfume, wonderful smell, lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Accurate description. Great price.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations</li>
    <li> Love it love and the smell last</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance, it smells so sexy yet not overwhelming, I definitely recommend this to any woman of any age. Packaging was also nicely wrapped very protected, came right when stated.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for someone that uses it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. Recommended for anyone that likes to smell great. I have received many compliments when I wear this perfume. Love it.</li>
    <li> My package was smashed and the perfume bottle was broken and empty</li>
    <li> Every person has different body chemistry and you have to find a fragrance that matches your own chemistry. I bought this without smelling it first (online) and when I got it, I didnt like the scent that much. However, the next day I did decide to put it on since I was out of everything else. All day I got compliments and people asking me what it was that I had on. I smelled my wrist and honestly, it did NOT smell the same way as it did, to me, from the bottle. So I guess my chemistry matches well with this fragrance. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> purchased for my daughter who looked for this everywhere and was selling in dept stores for twice the price, great deal at Amazon</li>
    <li> Love it, my favorite perfume. Am really excited to find it again and at a reasonable price I can afford!</li>
    <li> Such a good scent. I love it. Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> Great deal and beautiful smell for the money! My fav perfume at a great price and classy packaging :)</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this perfume with a sample from a friend and could not get over the pleasant scent. Not to strong just light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to order this because other people had posted that they had received knockoffs.  I can tell you that this product looks,  is packaged and smells exactly like every other Love &amp; Luck Ed Hardy perfume I have ever purchased.  I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; Get enough the fragrance is the best</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal and it is perfect!! it smells just like it does in the stores and it is authentic.</li>
    <li> I can barely walk any where without being complimented on this perfume! Has a very sweet, Mellow yet very sexy scent to it! By far one of my favs.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Very lovely fragrance for any occasion. One of my favorite Ed Hardy scents. Scent last all day and is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Scent didnt seem to last very long (thank God) compared to other E.H. perfumes. Didnt care for the smell either...kinda like Vanilla. I thought I smelled like an old lady</li>
    <li> I love this perfume but it is sadly discontinued. I am beyond thrilled that I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing and the price was so affordable. It came in a great amount of time and my husband is really loving this perfume as well</li>
    <li> Top notes are bergamot, blood orange and red saki&lt;br /&gt;Middle notes are black currant, nectarine, plum, pink pepper and jasmine,&lt;br /&gt;Base notes are musk, cedar, patchouli and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;This smells really good, with an opening burst of citrus, vodka and pepper. then, the peachy, fruity middle notes emerge. There&#x27;s a powdery ,woodsy finish.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bracing, uplifting and very different.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and service. It was just as they advertised and arrived when they said it would.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product  for many  years. This is the first time that the scent has been different and does not last, llike it had in the past........different formula or has it been compromised ?</li>
    <li> Buyer beware... I ordered this with high hopes due to a lower price than retail but when the product arrived I was incredibly concerned.  This was NOT Love &amp; Luck... the perfume had a gold color to it, Ed Hardy&#x27;s Love &amp; Luck is clear.  I had a bottle of Love &amp; Luck that wasn&#x27;t empty yet and smell tested several friends, it is NOT really Love &amp; Luck, the popular vote thinks this is some cheap perfume you&#x27;d buy at Kohl&#x27;s or Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Tried contacting seller regarding false advertising...no response.  After several attempts Amazon refunded my purchase.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume. i wear it everyday. nothing else smells like this and its not too strong so its perfect for someone who gets migraines from perfume scents. this one shouldnt give you any trouble.</li>
    <li> super fast shipping, thanks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s totally different from what i bought from store, smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;then i check the package precisely, they are also different.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s fake or went bad during the transportation.</li>
    <li> Considering what you are expected to pay in a retail store, I&#x27;m VERY pleased with my purchase.....came super quick, no damage and I&#x27;m happy !!!</li>
    <li> Received order exactly as I thought it would be.  My daughter loves this product so much that we bought 2 of the,</li>
    <li> I have truly enjoyed this product. It is a great summer sent and I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Woot</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume on the market.</li>
    <li> Great value for this fragrance.  It was almost triple the price in a local perfume store and it&#x27;s the same size!  Yay!  I get a lot of compliments on this fragrance.  My husband says I smell like &amp;#34;Vegas&amp;#34; when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance....nothing else to say! It is hard to find in stores so I am very glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> Great price! Great service. Product I normally pay much more for, &amp; love. What a treat to find something you love at a  decent price, &amp; delivered to your door in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Same product available at the stores, but at a noticeable savings.  If you are looking for this scent, it&#x27;s a no brainer, buy it here and save some cash.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this negative stars.  This is NOT the authentic Ed Hardy Love &amp; Luck.  The color is different, it smells different and the packaging has Asian letters.  Will NEVER order perfume from Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI--Knockoffs are ILLEGAL.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance it reminds me of Burberry but of course less expensive. Get a lot is compliments when I use it!</li>
    <li> Pleasant but nothing special.</li>
    <li> I love this one its soft yet people can still smell it.Its not an over powering scent.I would recommend it to someone who dosent like strong smells.</li>
    <li> I got this scent after getting the Women&#x27;s EDT - I love both fragrances very much - very nice winter fragrance.</li>
    <li> When I found out that they stopped selling this scent in stores I immediately went online to find a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have bought it from a better seller.&lt;br /&gt;It was super inexpensive, and shipped two days.&lt;br /&gt;Free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Killer deal.&lt;br /&gt;And it smells AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new perfume, or something as a gift, I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> For the price is the best perfume in the market, in my opinion, smell great, I received lots of compliments when I wear it and it last for a long time.  I will recomend this perfume to all women any age! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but I go through it so quickly! I can be sensitive to some perfumes but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
    <li> This is a awesome deal. Huge bottle and cheap. I looked in stores and they wanted over $80 for a bottle this size. This perfume smells really good and it stays on all day. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> she absolutely loves this perfume, it doesn&#x27;t have a real strong smell but it lasts all day. great for any women</li>
    <li> its what she wanted and it smells fine the wife is happy with it so i guess so am i</li>
    <li> Love it! So glad I could find it here at such a good price. It sticks around all day, and smells great. Extremely fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Authentic!!!!! Amazon customer services is the best........Thanks again...</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m a perfume snob, over the past 18 months I have fallen in love with collecting fragrances. I often like to buy them just by reading the descriptions of the top, middle, and bottom notes, and of course there have been a couple winners and a couple flops, and some just fall somewhere in the middle. This one is a winner, I&#x27;m so elated with this fragrance, not only with its crisp, clean, and exotic smell but also with its lasting power. The age range on this is a wide one, its not teeny-boppy and not overly mature, its just pleasant, soft, non-offensive, fresh, and entrancing all at once. I highly recommend this fragrance to anyone teetering on the ledge of whether to buy or not. I&#x27;m not an Ed Hardy fan, I don&#x27;t own a single rhinestone encrusted skull t-shirt, however, I don&#x27;t buy scents based on their labels or endorsements, I buy it based on the reviews and notes. This scent is a home-run and will be in heavy rotation at the front of my collection. It has just the right mix of clean/fresh and exotic. It would certainly work for all seasons! What are you waiting for?....BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My daughter couldnot believe I found this perfume- she had been looking in stores everywhere. She was also happy I got the big bottle!</li>
    <li> I received the gift set a couple years ago from my daughter and let it sit quite a while before I started wearing it. Now, all I have left is the mini bottle and I need more. I get more compliments on Love &amp; Luck than any other perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn and I&#x27;ve had some very good expensive perfumes. This one is the only one I want to wear now. LOVE IT!! Highly recommend everyone try it.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like the stuff that my sister got at the store and that&#x27;s what I was hoping for. It&#x27;s the exact same brand but doesn&#x27;t smell the same. Kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original perfume at all!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> I used up the bottle I bought at Ulta and couldn&#x27;t believe that this is no longer sold in stores - or at least I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE!!  So - once again - Amazon to the rescue!!  And, of course, it&#x27;s way less expensive on Amazon.  In fact, a friend liked the scent on me and when she told me she couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, I told her to order it from Amazon.  She did and is very pleased!</li>
    <li> Smells great, my husband says this is the best perfume smell on me.  Will purchase again, light and not too musky, just right.</li>
    <li> When I first sprayed this on at the store, the smell was so great and I fell instantly in love! Naturally, I saw that Amazon sold it cheaper, so I ordered it from here. It arrived and when I sprayed it, it smelled almost sour, not at all like when I sampled it in the store. Bottom line, just be aware that it may not be exactly what you expected from Amazon.</li>
    <li> not the real Ed Hardy, fake as heck, I am so upset Chinese Writing, I have bought enought authentic Ed Hardy to know the real deal, the first hint was the Chinese Emblems all over the bottle and contain</li>
    <li> I love this!  I&#x27;m not into flowers and such and this is perfect.  It&#x27;s not too over powering and works for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. out of all the perfume on the market ed hardy did a good job</li>
