<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This item works perfect I never had a problem with it get rid of pimples and acne really quick</li>
    <li> Black head and blemish remover kit is great that comes with 5 instruments for all use. I had blackhead on my nose so wanna try this and it done a great job. I am a beautician so I need this for facial, acne, pimple remover so I bought this one. This done a great job it removes easily the blackheads without pain, marks on a face.when you are ready to remove do steaming on your face by boiling the water and let the steam pass on your face for 3 mins so the pores opens and then use this kit to remove. It clearly removes all. Excellent quality and this comes with the case so that if you want to carry out is easy and compact. I bought this product for trying out and in exchange of reviews and i honestly done. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s five different  tools in this set. The case is very sturdy  and has a spot for each tool. I wish it included  tips on which tool is best for what blemish  so it will  take some figuring out. It&#x27;s great  for getting those difficult  blackheads I&#x27;ve had for so long. I received  this  product  in exchange  for  my  honest  review</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions. I wonder if the tools wood be working if I understood how to use them.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and as described. I deal with a lot of blackheads on and around my nose area. Initially, I was curious if the product would have any effect with dealing with my blackhead issue. I was surprised with the effectiveness of the product; in following the instructions, I was able to carefully remove most of the larger blackheads fairly easily. The smaller ones take a bit of effort but it&#x27;s possible. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received at a reduced price, by the manufacturer, in order to facilitate a review. Please contact me if you have any questions.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit with very handy and easy to use tools! Fast and friendly service! Highly recommend this product! Fast delivery and great price! I got this through AMZ review trader.</li>
    <li> There are two camps of people when it comes to pimples and blackheads. Those that think you should just let them be, and those that think you should remove them. I am firmly in the remove them camp. A lifetime of really good skin, with the occasion pimple has taught me that removal really is the best way to handle blemishes. This kit arms you with everything you could need to rid yourself of unsightly blackheads and blemishes. With five different options you are sure to never meet a blemish that you cannot beat. I like to do this after my shower but before I wash my face for the night. Granted it is not a nightly thing for me, as I do not have blemishes all the time. I do get blackheads pretty often and this has helped greatly with that. I love that they all come in a traveling case, so they are easy to find, and easy to keep clean. I do sanitize them as suggested in rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All the opinions expressed are completely my own.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get to try this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am not terribly prone to acne, but have the occasional blemish and I feel like my nose has been looking more like a strawberry lately. So when I got this in the mail I was eager to try it out. I opened it and its in a nice zippered case and everything is laid out in a nice organized manner. However...there is nothing in the kit telling me which tool does what. I have no idea what a blemish extractor looks like or a blackhead remover. There&#x27;s also something that resembles a shovel. I have no clue what to do with that one. I used the power of the internet and got a rough idea of how to use the tools. There are some instructions on the box, and I followed those. I was able to get my nose scraped nice and clean. Its looking much less strawberry now, thanks to these tools. It&#x27;s a set of 5 stainless steel tools, just like in the picture. I just wish there had been some labeling somewhere telling me the name of each tool so I could have a better understanding of how to use them. I feel like there&#x27;s only 1 or 2 out of the 5 that I will actually use.</li>
    <li> This blackhead &amp; Blemish remover kit is great. It is easy to use and the products are very professional. They are quality made and come in a nice case. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, I recommend giving this product a try if you have trouble skin. These tools help prevent the scarring and pain that you get when squeezing and popping. It&#x27;s a money saver to have the tools to do it yourself at home vs going to a dermatologist to have your blackheads and blemishes removed.</li>
    <li> I just received this in time to test out on a huge pimple!  Worked great!  Nice that I dont have to pinch my skin like crazy with these.</li>
    <li> This kit was better than I expected... Each part of the tools were designed to tackle any kind of blackhead/whitehead possible. Used this on the boyfriend last night (I made sure to follow the instructions of steaming his face beforehand to open up the pores) and I was able to get the blackheads that were on his nose and the hard to reach spots on the sides of his nostrils. He complained that it hurt when I applied pressure, but I may have used the wrong tool end; all it took was trial and error and we were able to get them all. A nice plus was the red/black carrying case that it came with. I&#x27;d recommend this kit for anyone who is prone to blackheads or have large pores. Do follow the instructions on the box for best results.</li>
    <li> My teenager son has typical teenage acne, but he also has a lot of blackheads. I got this for him&lt;br /&gt;to see if it helps with the blackheads. I had him do a warm/hot washcloth on his face first to steam&lt;br /&gt;open his pores. Then he tried to use the tools, which for someone who has never picked at his face&lt;br /&gt;before, he has sensitive skin, so it took a little bit for him to get use to the amount of pressure he&lt;br /&gt;needed to use, which you don&#x27;t need to use much. And they work, we were both impressed, he still&lt;br /&gt;has a lot to take care of, but I didn&#x27;t want him to do it all in one day and aggravate his skin. These tools&lt;br /&gt;are simple but effective.  I  bought this product at a promotional price for review. All of my reviews are&lt;br /&gt;honest and based off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experiences.</li>
    <li> this product is great! Use caution, as you have to know how to use the devices or you could damage your skin.  The different size options and the carrying case is a great feature to keep the product sterile and clean when not in use.  We did receive this product free for conducting a review, but have been very pleased and would purchase!</li>
    <li> This is one of the smartest things I&#x27;ve ever bought!  I get blackheads just under my eyes that are almost impossible to get out by squeezing with my fingers.  When I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works incredibly!  Follow the directions and  make sure you skin is hydrated (I put a warm towel on my face for about 10-15 minutes) and then use these tools to easily remove those gross blackheads and whiteheads.  I was surprised how easy the process was and how much it cleaned up my pores!  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. This makes getting rid of piples and blackheads way quicker and less painful. I have used it on a few pimples on my face and one on my back and have to say it works great. Simple to use the remover kit is built of quality materials and will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Lots of different sizes perfect for any size problem!</li>
    <li> Great set received at discount for review. Nice to have around the house.</li>
    <li> Works great, exactly as described. Tools are of quality metal and fit nicely in carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received a discount for reviewing this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great kit. I have really bad acne and this has helped get rid of them without pain</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Quality product as advertised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Every tool you could need! With these and a mud mask, you can have could at-home spa facial for pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look to be made of high-quality of stainless steel, with excellent grips and nice carrying case, which has a protective lining and cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: While I was given a discount on this item, I was not paid for my review and it is my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below.
