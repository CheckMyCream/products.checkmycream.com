      <li>Bought several times, love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I bought it for someone who is somewhat of a &#x27;hippy&#x27; and a vegetarian, and was pleased that these HEMP products were not only well-received by her, but did not contain any &#x27;offensive&#x27; ingredients.</li>

      <li>Within a month of regular use, my dandruff woes are almost completely gone!  </li>
      <li>it was different from no other suave conditioner i ever tried</li>
      <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again which is unfortunate since I love HEMPZ products in general.</li>
      <li>which is fine by me since I have thin hair</li>
      <li>Due to genetics and the arid climate I live in, I felt that it was just going to be part of life for me.  </li>

    <li> Hemp Conditioner Hydrating is great and i love the smell. I found that it done what it clams to. For me anyway.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, but leaves my fine hair lifeless and flat. It may work for other hair types.</li>
    <li> After just one wash with the shampoo and conditioner combination my hair feels baby soft. I have tried many expensive products to make my hair feel healthy not just look healthy. This by far surpassed my expectations, and my hair smells clean and fresh and I&#x27;m going on about 48 hours since I washed it and it still feels soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Amazing im allergic to a lot of shampoo and this one fix that and my dandruff also pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> thank you  great stuff  makes hair really soft</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner!! very hydrating and great with splitends and frizzy</li>
    <li> This product will make your hair so soft to the touch.  Your hair will gleam and look healthier and feel thicker.  I will only use this brand and have it in stock at all times.[[ASIN:B0073SB73G Hemp Conditioner Hydrating 13.5 oz.]]</li>
    <li> I have intense scalp issues and I have struggled to battle the dandruff and itching all my life.  I have used ever sort of dandruff/dry scalp/hydrating shampoo you can imagine, prescription and not.  Due to genetics and the arid climate I live in, I felt that it was just going to be part of life for me.  Until I found this stuff!  Both the shampoo as well as the conditioner have totally transformed the look, feel, and make-up of my hair and scalp.  Within a month of regular use, my dandruff woes are almost completely gone!  I cannot express to you enough... If you have the same problems I did, you NEED THIS!</li>
    <li> Too thick to get out of the bottle , so you have to open the top.. It&#x27;s okay..It smells like Lemon grass..</li>
    <li> I think i got ripped off!</li>
    <li> love it, love the way my long hair feels after using this product. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> It was not as I expected, it leaves my hair feeling greasy.  Not something I would buy again.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> My gf has a problem with her hair frizzing after it dries so I bought her this and the matching shampoo. Sad to say she told me it left her hair clumpy and didn&#x27;t resolve the frizz issue. She used it for a week and then stopped since it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair super soft and with no tangles. I didn&#x27;t read anything about it helping with frizziness...but then again i use something separate for that since I have bad frizziness too after showering. It did untangle my hair and leave it extremely soft. I use the conditioner with the shampoo and my hair is so shiny, full of life, soft, and smelling really good. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I wish I had researched into the stuff companies are putting into these sorts of products before I bought this. This one has just about everything bad that&#x27;s commonly used. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), Propylene Glycol (PPG), Methylisothiazolinone (MIT), and more. It does have more good ingredients than many of the well-known brands do, but I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for conditioner that is healthy. I&#x27;m not taking the risk with known dangerous ingredients when I don&#x27;t have to. I will try to remember to upload a \\&quot;customer image\\&quot; of the ingredient list when I have some time.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the Hempz brand ... my fault for not paying attention. Don&#x27;t waste money on this knock-off.</li>
    <li> Bought several times, love this conditioner. Arrived fast, great seller</li>
    <li> Nice smell, but very thick, and difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, along with HEMP Hydrating Shampoo 13.5 oz. and Hempz Herbal Lip Balm .44 oz (14 g) as a gift for a loved one. She loves the way her hair looks, feels, and smells. I have not used any of these items personally. I bought it for someone who is somewhat of a &#x27;hippy&#x27; and a vegetarian, and was pleased that these HEMP products were not only well-received by her, but did not contain any &#x27;offensive&#x27; ingredients.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and condition smell yummy!  However, the condition is super thick and no matter how hard you try, you will not get it through that tiny hole. I have to take off the top and squeeze to get a good amount without hurting myself.  Conditioner doesn&#x27;t really condition in my opinion but sort of dries my hair out which is fine by me since I have thin hair anyway so it volumizes rather than hydrates.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again which is unfortunate since I love HEMPZ products in general.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used Hemp shampoo and conditioner.  Not sure how she started but she just absolutely loves how her hair smells and feels when she does use it.</li>
    <li> I Use This it all natural and smells good to. so far it is a good and safe conditioner and makes my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
