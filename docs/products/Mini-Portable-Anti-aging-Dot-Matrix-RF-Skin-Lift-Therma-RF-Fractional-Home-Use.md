      <li>So far so good, very nice!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s packaged beautifully and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Having had a pretty great results with at-home fraxel I was looking for something that firms the skin as opposed to just clearing it.</li>
      <li>but I am sure at my age, it takes time.  </li>
      <li>and hopefully it gets better and will re-evaluate my review but as of now, no difference.</li>
      <li>I will say my turkey neck is probably 20 percent better already</li>
      <li>However, a word for the wise...when you order this, be sure to order some sort of conductor gel with it so that you can immediately begin using your Norlanya.</li>
      <li>but I can tell you this device has truly done wonders and helped get rid of many.</li>
      <li>A bit time consuming, but okay product.  </li>
      <li>I love this unit.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Do not fret, worry or obsess let your body heal and you&#x27;ll be so glad you did.</li>

      <li>Okay, I never write reviews.</li>
      <li>and my chin and jawline are becoming more defined looking again.  </li>
      <li>It might be great for others, but my skin was too sensitive.</li>
      <li>Especially great at getting rid of deep laugh lines.</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t burn the home user&#x27;s face easily</li>
      <li>Maybe the manufacture could consider to improve on the size of indicating light.</li>
      <li>so far so good...</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pay attention the garbage instructions that come with it because I, to believe that the company wants to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
      <li>so I firstly tested it on my inner forearm to make sure no allergic reaction and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m ok with the heat.</li>
      <li>I am seeing results so quickly.  </li>
      <li>I use an organic aloe vera gel and hold it on high in one spot until I can&#x27;t stand the heat any more.  </li>
      <li>But it does get HOT!</li>
      <li>This little gaget works great</li>
      <li>it well worth</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the funds right now to buy another.  </li>
      <li>If anyone wants to buy my unit, I am willing to sell it to them at a reduced price!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the effectiveness, and I bought a second unit to do my face faster.</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference from the first use</li>
      <li>It does get hot</li>
      <li>but so does a hot iron on your face.  </li>
      <li>I had to look it up online first, and eventually found videos demonstrating &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34</li>
      <li>would like to leave more feedback once we have had the chance to use long term as it has only been approx a week thus far.&lt;br /&gt;We are happy with what we are seeing at this point and hopefully will see long term results once we use it over an extended period of time..</li>
      <li>So, be fair, since it requires regular routine usage over a period of time to see the result, I&#x27;m gonna give it a 6 month try, then I will come back here to update</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think to much about it when I use it for the first how hot it was getting.</li>
      <li>I know heat plays a very important role in the success of &amp;#34;thermage&amp;#34;, and I find the heat is not consistent in this machine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using the head to stamp on my face, stamping technique, I feel fine to stay on one spot for 5 seconds (moderate heat)</li>
      <li>I have always done IPL treatment with very high heat, so</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say it has really &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; in one way or another.</li>
      <li>I spend almost an hour per session- 3x per week using this and have followed some reviewers&#x27; comments to keep it on one spot till you really feel the heat which is why it takes me almost an hour per session.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to test it on my husband as well, haha.</li>
      <li>They say Aloe Very gel works, so I think you can find this at Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>This device really does deliver results.</li>
      <li>Because I use the Arctic Ice Analgesic gel (from the Dollar Store)  with this unit, it keeps it totally pain free.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using long so as far as producing more collagen</li>
      <li>and I really think it takes more than this to get any real change, but as for wrinkles, well this nearly 50 year old has next to no wrinkles, yeah</li>
      <li>Also, the area just above my lips is much more sensitive and easily feel sting than other areas.    </li>
      <li>Sometimes it gets hot enough that I feel it&#x27;s doing something; other times, it barely feels warm.</li>
      <li>absolutely can recommend this, any fine lines and wrinkles improve and disappear in very short time, the pore claim, hmmm jury is still out on that simply because like a lot of people I have a lot of enlarged pores on my nose</li>
      <li>The professional treatment really hurt-</li>
      <li>So far I really like this device.  </li>
      <li>Also, a charge only lasted about 7 minutes worth of use.  </li>
      <li>My face is very sensitive</li>
      <li>Has this been tested to see if it is actually putting out RF&#x27;s or does it just gets hot to make us think it does ...</li>
      <li>Only came with one head and it intermittently gets hot on and off and that&#x27;s on level three,</li>
      <li>I put it on my face for sometimes over a minute in different areas and move it when it gets hot to another area.  </li>
      <li>but it turned out OK, not much discomfort and minimal redness when I use sliding technique.</li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 2 months now and it hasn&#x27;t done any difference to my eyebags/dark circles and the lines from my nose to my mouth (nasolabial lines) or my neck.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s just</li>
      <li>I really would like to see some solid scientific studies.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 39 years old.</li>
      <li>I had Thermage done professionally about 15 years ago.</li>
      <li>Professional machines have to be by a derm or surgeon.</li>
      <li>So far my daughter and I have seen results with some lifting of sagging skin and scars reduced/ plumped in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>WOW.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this device my face was very red the next day, however I didn&#x27;t let that stop me.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that something so small can have such fabulous results!</li>
      <li>sometimes while in high the heat could not be felt, then switched to low and it burned my skin!</li>
      <li>NORLANYA Mini Portable Anti-aging Dot Matrix Skin Care RF Thermage Fractional RF Device with NEW Head (Updated Energy)&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be used if you have facial fillers in place.  </li>
      <li>I just think the indicating light of low/moderate/high is too small dot making it somewhat not noticeable enough to see which mode I&#x27;m using.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really let you know a lot about it.</li>
      <li>To really do your whole face, to &amp;#34;stamp&amp;#34; it and maybe get a few red marks&lt;br /&gt;Takes</li>
      <li>I let it go a little and press the right strength to just feel the heat work on face.</li>
      <li>I personally do not believe this is product is worth the small improvements I had.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Noticed a difference from the first use</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s just o.k. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really let you know a lot about it. SORRY</li>
    <li> absolutely can recommend this, any fine lines and wrinkles improve and disappear in very short time, the pore claim, hmmm jury is still out on that simply because like a lot of people I have a lot of enlarged pores on my nose and I really think it takes more than this to get any real change, but as for wrinkles, well this nearly 50 year old has next to no wrinkles, yeah some is def due to genes and care but I can tell you this device has truly done wonders and helped get rid of many.</li>
    <li> so far so good... I will update post in 3 months</li>
    <li> I am 62  and have used the unit 3 times in 2 weeks.  The day after each use, I can see results.  I don&#x27;t look younger yet but I am sure at my age, it takes time.  I will say my turkey neck is probably 20 percent better already and my chin and jawline are becoming more defined looking again.  WOW.  But, I don&#x27;t use it like they say.  I use an organic aloe vera gel and hold it on high in one spot until I can&#x27;t stand the heat any more.  Then I move close by to that area.  Let&#x27;s say when I am finished my face and neck are red and I think they should be.  I do not keep it in one spot until it hurts bad, just until it barely begins to sting.  I have great expectations for the Dot Matrix.  I am seeing results so quickly.  I will use it once per week for 12-14 sessions and then monthly.  After each use, I use a hydrating mask.  Otherwise your skin will become very dry.  I plan to try it on my hands also.  Definitely recommend.    HOWEVER, could someone - maybe the seller or manufacturer answer me.  In cleaning, I popped off the head and the little white rubber piece that fits onto the unit before you put the head back o n.  Well I lost this little rubbery piece and now I am afraid to use the machine.  Can someone tell me what to do?  I don&#x27;t have the funds right now to buy another.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far my daughter and I have seen results with some lifting of sagging skin and scars reduced/ plumped in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to leave more feedback once we have had the chance to use long term as it has only been approx a week thus far.&lt;br /&gt;We are happy with what we are seeing at this point and hopefully will see long term results once we use it over an extended period of time.. glad I made the purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 39 years old. I had noticable difference in frown lines on forehead after 2nd use!</li>
    <li> I love this unit. I faithfully use it and it does work. Especially great at getting rid of deep laugh lines.</li>
    <li> I have read and re-read reviews for this product on numerous occasions before ordering. Having had a pretty great results with at-home fraxel I was looking for something that firms the skin as opposed to just clearing it. Having done research on ultherapy and thermage I figured that for this price to just give it a try knowing that I could return it if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it works! Don&#x27;t pay attention the garbage instructions that come with it because I, to believe that the company wants to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself. I have been using now for two weeks/3x a week. I followed there directions and was pretty much disappointed but having remembered another reviewer that keep it directly on until you literally can&#x27;t take it anymore. I went ahead and did that and BAM! I literally felt the skin shrink under my eyes and saw how it seem to weld the collagen that was loosely dispersed together almost sealing my under eye bag. It seems to shrink the puff and if you leave the heat on long enough you can actually feel the skin tighten and it kinda scares you a bit. I haven&#x27;t been using long so as far as producing more collagen well that takes time but if this little sucker can seal the under eye bags that have plagued me from birth it well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP THE HEAT ON LONGER THAN RECOMMENDED. YES, you are gonna be red. YES, you are gonna be puffy. NO, you aren&#x27;t gonna suffer from third degree burns. YES, you are gonna look slightly off the next day. Do not fret, worry or obsess let your body heal and you&#x27;ll be so glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the effectiveness, and I bought a second unit to do my face faster. This device really does deliver results. FANTASTIC product, and great customer service.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this device my face was very red the next day, however I didn&#x27;t let that stop me. I have used it several times in a few weeks so I can&#x27;t say it has really &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; in one way or another. I have hope though! I am going to u-tube the possibilities in using the device I may have missed and assure I am using it in the most efficient way. Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> The packaging is beautiful. The box is unusual,and it is lined in a pink satin-like material.. I was impressed with that. However, a word for the wise...when you order this, be sure to order some sort of conductor gel with it so that you can immediately begin using your Norlanya. They say Aloe Very gel works, so I think you can find this at Wal-Mart. I didn&#x27;t order any with mine, and found some online to order, so I had to wait till that order came in before I could begin using it. I&#x27;m not a very patient person, I guess, especially when I have a new product I am anxious to try.&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out on this product. I know heat plays a very important role in the success of &amp;#34;thermage&amp;#34;, and I find the heat is not consistent in this machine. Sometimes it gets hot enough that I feel it&#x27;s doing something; other times, it barely feels warm. Also, the instructions are rather confusing. I had to look it up online first, and eventually found videos demonstrating &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34; it. Otherwise, I might still be sitting here staring at it.&lt;br /&gt;If, in the future, I see some sort of miracle results from this, I will let you know. But, for now, I&#x27;m not counting on it.</li>
    <li> I will write another review later.  I have not had this but a month,in the beginning I had problem using it but Lisa at customer service walked me thur the  things I was doing incorrect and answered all my question. I guess I should do a 5 star with all her help, but just have not used it long enough.  I do feel like it&#x27;s going to help I can see a little diference  in my pores and jawline.  After I use the device I put a really cold wash cloth on my face about 10 to 15 minutes then I use Vitamin C on my face let it dry, then I used Hyaluronic Acid cream. I used the vitamin C and cream everyday morning and night plus a sun screen in the mornings.</li>
    <li> So far so good, very nice!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 2 months now and it hasn&#x27;t done any difference to my eyebags/dark circles and the lines from my nose to my mouth (nasolabial lines) or my neck. I&#x27;m hoping this will take care of those but it has not. I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully it gets better and will re-evaluate my review but as of now, no difference. I spend almost an hour per session- 3x per week using this and have followed some reviewers&#x27; comments to keep it on one spot till you really feel the heat which is why it takes me almost an hour per session.  I would welcome any helpful ideas from my fellow reviewers  (and/or seller!)  Like I said I will reevaluate my review once I see any good developments but as of now, literally no difference at all.</li>
    <li> This product works great</li>
    <li> I had Thermage done professionally about 15 years ago. The professional treatment really hurt- but did see results and it was costly. This unit takes more time to see the results, but the price is considerably less, and certainly is less painful.  Between this unit and the Derma Roller (also purchased through Amazon)  I think I am seeing results. Because I use the Arctic Ice Analgesic gel (from the Dollar Store)  with this unit, it keeps it totally pain free. I use this every third day. This is inexpensive and like the results.</li>
    <li> i dont know if anyone else experienced this but where i used it i broke out really bad in red dots. dont know what or why this happened . has anyone else had this happen to them?</li>
    <li> Very unhappy.  I tried all the suggestions on the reviews and it actually burnt my skin.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have used the system now for two  months and I have not seen any changes in my skin no smaller pores no tightening of the skin ..I keep hoping to see something ...I may have to return it.. save your money don&#x60;t buy it</li>
    <li> A bit time consuming, but okay product.  You must use it regularly to see results and continue it&#x27;s use. I do like to use it with a collagen serum.  Make my skin feel rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> Okay, I never write reviews. But I read the reviews before I brought one. So I purchase one. I have always done IPL treatment with very high heat, so I didn&#x27;t think to much about it when I use it for the first how hot it was getting. I just want you to know to be very careful because before I knew it I had burned my face in several places. I just hope it does not leave scars. But I have not given up. But I will be extra careful the next time. I am not going to rate it until I get to try it again. But it does get HOT!</li>
    <li> Just bought mine... cant wait !</li>
    <li> So far I really like this device.  I think it does what it says.  Went on youtube to watch tutorials on usage...that helped a lot.  I use every few days and can feel a difference.  I will review again after I&#x27;ve had it for awhile but so far so good.</li>
    <li> NORLANYA Mini Portable Anti-aging Dot Matrix Skin Care RF Thermage Fractional RF Device with NEW Head (Updated Energy)&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be used if you have facial fillers in place.  Nowhere did I find this info in the description of the product.  I am disappointed and thought this information should be made available to future purchasers.  Delivery was swift,just wish I could use it.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for this aestheician</li>
    <li> It worked once, as in, produced heat, and then not again. After contacting the manufacturer, a round of emails ensued. Having to troubleshoot a new purchase over emails is not a good business model. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> so far so good. it&#x27;s packaged beautifully and fast delivery. nice instruction booklet with illustration is enclosed, however, I found no mention about how to use it for forehead, I guess I could do the usual way just like my other facial massager on forehead?    I just tried it today. My face is very sensitive so I firstly tested it on my inner forearm to make sure no allergic reaction and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m ok with the heat. Then I used moderate heat on my face and low energy below my eyes with gel applied of course, I thought my face skin would get really red &amp; dry/peeling on moderate heat but it turned out OK, not much discomfort and minimal redness when I use sliding technique. I&#x27;ve tried using the head to stamp on my face, stamping technique, I feel fine to stay on one spot for 5 seconds (moderate heat) but if it stays longer I will feel sting and hurt feeling,,,well, the instruction says no more than 5 seconds stay on moderate, so I should never overheat myself!    One thing I noticed is if I pressed the head too hard onto my face I could not feel the heat well, anyway, I think it&#x27;d probably not good to press that hard, so I let it go a little and press the right strength to just feel the heat work on face. Also, the area just above my lips is much more sensitive and easily feel sting than other areas.    As for the effect, I cannot comment at this time because I do think it takes time to achieve the desired result. This home used product is definitely not strong as the RF machine or laser treatment used at clinic. I would say it delivers softer energy so it won&#x27;t burn the home user&#x27;s face easily, otherwise, it&#x27;s very dangerous to be used by non-medical professional and there might be many damage claims. So, be fair, since it requires regular routine usage over a period of time to see the result, I&#x27;m gonna give it a 6 month try, then I will come back here to update, maybe I will update at 3 months interval....I&#x27;m going to test it on my husband as well, haha.As for the product design, I like how it looks. I just think the indicating light of low/moderate/high is too small dot making it somewhat not noticeable enough to see which mode I&#x27;m using. Maybe the manufacture could consider to improve on the size of indicating light.</li>
    <li> Used it faithfully for a few weeks as directed.  I saw only tiny improvements.  I personally do not believe this is product is worth the small improvements I had.  If anyone wants to buy my unit, I am willing to sell it to them at a reduced price!  :)</li>
    <li> This little gaget works great but you do need to give it time!!</li>
    <li> Only came with one head and it intermittently gets hot on and off and that&#x27;s on level three, level one and two are non existent. To really do your whole face, to &amp;#34;stamp&amp;#34; it and maybe get a few red marks&lt;br /&gt;Takes FOREVER ,and the charge won&#x27;t even last that long . Beautiful packaging and instructions, but I think a lot of kinks need to be worked out still. Don&#x27;t even know why they even bother with level one on it. Sent it back</li>
    <li> In my case I didn&#x27;t see the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every other day for the past week and really have not notice if it&#x27;s working.  I put it on my face for sometimes over a minute in different areas and move it when it gets hot to another area.  I am using the &amp;#34;High Mode&amp;#34;. It does get hot but so does a hot iron on your face.  Has this been tested to see if it is actually putting out RF&#x27;s or does it just gets hot to make us think it does ... I really would like to see some solid scientific studies.  I&#x27;ll give it another week if I see no difference I will send it back.  Thank God for Amazon Prime&#x27;s great return policy.</li>
    <li> Only used it three times, but I can see a difference the next morning.  It&#x27;s already lightened up a spot I have on the side of my face.  Radio frequency is a great treatment for the skin.  I&#x27;ll be keeping track of my progress.</li>
    <li> Sent this product bAck</li>
    <li> used it a few times so no results</li>
    <li> Will never buy anything from Norlanya. There were no instructions no charger and the pad that goes on the head was also missing. Extremely disappointed. A total waste of money. I wish there were negative stars in the ratings. This would definitely get a negative 5star rating.</li>
    <li> I noticed results almost immediately. The only thing was I sometimes felt mild shocking in my fingers, but was advised how to reduce the chances of this happening.</li>
    <li> Only had it a week or s I see results. On UTUBE I have been watching and have ordered Mini Claire from Christine Byer Master Esthestician gave a good review for a home use. Professional machines have to be by a derm or surgeon. She told me up front sagging skin needs RF. GUESS WHAT-My chin, around my mouth, SAGGING UPPER EYE LIDS are up in one week. Watch her review on UTUBE  as well as comment on amazon and manufactors directions. HOPE you have good results like I. Gonna order two to save time.</li>
    <li> Seemed like it was going to work well, but the settings and heat would go up and down without warning...sometimes while in high the heat could not be felt, then switched to low and it burned my skin! Also, a charge only lasted about 7 minutes worth of use.  I sent it back</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that something so small can have such fabulous results! My pores seem smaller already and it&#x27;s a great product for a great price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product did not react well with my skin. It might be great for others, but my skin was too sensitive.</li>
