<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great item great price</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t bought this toothbrush, you need to purchase it. My teeth have been classified for a military secret weapon since they became a super-mirror like finish.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!  Exactly as promised...</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush and HX6062 heads, they come on time, every time!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my Sonicare toothbrush</li>
    <li> So far so good this is the 3rd replacement</li>
    <li> A little pricey but it is worth it. Does a great job, the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE my Philips Sonicare Diamond toothbrush! These replacements have always worked great.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if Phillips thought to take a picture of these units from the bottom, so that people could &#x27;see&#x27; if they fit the drive unit?!</li>
    <li> Got a killer deal on these brush heads. I love the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling after brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> this tooth brush is as described, smart easy to use, not a complicated charge and very cool looking, which is a plus</li>
    <li> Great replacement product</li>
    <li> Nothing beats OEM for the Sonicare.  I&#x27;ve learned that trying to save a few bucks by buying the generic heads is not worth it.  These work much better and are worth the extra coin.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare toothbrushes have served me very well for over a decade, and the Diamond Clean brush heads have made my experience even better.  I am impressed not only by the quality of Sonicare brush systems but their continuing improvements such as the class holder, the black color, and the Diamond Clean brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my diamond toothbrush and these replacement heads work with it perfectly.</li>
    <li> The quality is good.I love this product, because its very hard to buy this color in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buy it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has really made a difference when having my teeth cleaned (yesterday) really minimizes the plaque.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever purchased</li>
    <li> These are legit Diamond Clean brush heads. Very pleased. Good price.  Wish they had a larger pack for further savings.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic. My only complaint is the packaging. It is the sealed plastic retail type that requires a knife and significant effort to tear open.</li>
    <li> Great product, just don&#x27;t like the value. Where is the 6-pack for the black Diamond Clean?!  Make sure you don&#x27;t force the brush on you teeth. Just put it in your mouth and let it do its job. (Giggity)</li>
    <li> These brush heads work really great! When I go to the dentist office, I&#x27;m usually out within 15 minutes. The only times it takes longer is if they have to do X-rays.</li>
    <li> Love our Sonicare Diamond!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for years, and it is no hype to say that it&#x27;s the best toothbrush ever! When the sleek black Diamond was released, I HAD to have it, so I sadly retired my white handle. My hygienist, the world&#x27;s most demanding (but immensely likable) woman told me yesterday that she has never seen my teeth and gums in better condition, and I was ecstatic - no scaling needed! I highly recommend this product to everyone who dislikes spending time in a dentist&#x27;s chair. Despite its price, the Sonicare paid for itself in two visits.</li>
    <li> Amazing product by philips! incredible performance &amp; amazing improvement after just 2 days of usage! Cleaner &amp; more polished teeth!</li>
    <li> Compatible with my Philips Sonicare HX9352/04 Diamond Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. I wanted black, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement heads from the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get enough of this toothbrush, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in the last year.  To have a convenient option for replacement heads is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Love this toothbrush and amazon had the best price in town plus a instant rebate!</li>
    <li> Works well.  If only there were less expensive but good quality versions</li>
    <li> Bought these after &amp;#34;discovering&amp;#34; an old Sonicare toothbrush during a recent move. These replacement heads work great and am very satisfied with my purchase for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Two pack so both the wife and I have our own (I make her put a dab of nail polish on hers so we don&#x27;t get them mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Fit snugly and don&#x27;t come loose with vibrations like another brand I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Small brush head really is able to get in the small spaces necessary to get everything clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Make a good foaming lather that makes my teeth feel dentist clean.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipping time!</li>
    <li> This brush is very good although it does NOT last as long as Philips claims...at least for my wife and myself who both use the product.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush to date! Great product, and works wonderful.</li>
    <li> This the most amazing in product I have ever purchased ! I was a manual toothbrush user for years! This was worth every dollar! Gives me the clean feeling as if I have my personal hygienist in a brush! Would recommend it, if you like to smile like me, put your money where your mouth is!</li>
    <li> They are toothbrush heads. Period.</li>
    <li> This was the best value for my money. After using the diamond clean from Sonicare, I will not use anything else. The results on my teeth could be seen and felt in just one day. After a week of brushing, teeth are whiter. No special toothpaste needed. Purchased the Sonicare Airfloss and also love this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good deal.</li>
    <li> It was an OEM replacement for about half the price of our local store. So I now have a years worth of brush heads. :)</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush heads are perfect! Exactly what I needed and wanted. They arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> i think these are great just too expensive</li>
    <li> As much as I hate the DiamondClean toothbrush bc of the mess it does around, this is a very good head which fits perfectly and works well for a deep clean.</li>
    <li> Love my sonicare diamond, and this replacement brush is just right. Right price, fit and delivery. Much better than paying big bucks for the same item elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great product...the only way to go is the manufacturer brush heads....the after market ones just don&#x27;t work that great....imo.</li>
    <li> High quality that matters! Will continue to purchase with this great vendor</li>
    <li> Works great as advertised !!</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for the diamond brush, great quality, reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;They last a long time and are sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I use them all the time!</li>
    <li> No complaints, love the multiple settings and the charge lasts for weeks. I would recommend this to anyone who likes clean teeth.</li>
    <li> We have had our Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for over a year now and they are excellent. We replaced the brush heads with the Diamond Clean models and they have easily met our expectations. We will never go back to ordinary toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Theses are so nice and work so good on your teeth.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are the exact same ones I got with my sonicare toothbrush (HX9352). Using them after one has worn out will leave you with a definite smile as it did for me because I start to remember how well these brushes actually clean your teeth. I wouldn&#x27;t look for any other brush heads.</li>
    <li> This is the OEM replacement set of diamond brush heads. I have been extremely pleased with the Philips Sonicare, and my latest dentist visit was proof enough that I will never go back to manual brushing. My hygenist said she had never in 20 years spent as little time cleaning a patient&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wanted to point out here is that I noticed a HUGE difference between my old brush head, which was only about 6 months old. It&#x27;s a night and day difference! The brand new head is gentler, firmer, and for some reason it doesn&#x27;t make as much noise as the older brush head. Replacing these every 3-4 months seems correct as Philips recommends.</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes, but a little pricey. They will usually never go wrong when you order them unless you bought the wrong toothbrushes or broken bristles - highly unlikely.</li>
    <li> I feel like my teeth get professionally cleaned every day, plus this toothbrush is gorgeous! all in all a great addition to my life and my bathroom!</li>
    <li> These were purchased with our Philips toothbrush as spares so they&#x27;re still in the package but they are the right tips and the original ones work great!</li>
    <li> Work better than the standard heads that came with my base unit. These hold back the plaque build-up.</li>
    <li> Great product fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> My dentist brothers told me to ditch what I was using for teeth cleaning and get a sonicare years ago. They assured me this was the route to better oral care and good ceckups.  Years later this has proved to be great advice  DO UPDATE TO THESE NEW BRUSH HEADS! If you and your teeth can tolerate&lt;br /&gt;These stiffer brushes, I&#x27;m sure they are doing a superior job, especially between my teeth. They did take a few brushings to become accustomed to.</li>
    <li> really like the brush will buy again, but i guess I have to if I want to use the tooth brush</li>
    <li> In addition to expensive, everything else was fine. Philips toothbrush to my mouth brings more healthy, I will insist, I hope Amazon do this type of trade promotion activities</li>
    <li> I really like my Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush - it keeps my teeth and gums nice and healthy with regular use, which also makes for better dentist visits. I like the black color of this toothbrush, so it&#x27;s great to have replacement heads that match. Amazon&#x27;s prices beat Target, so this is the place to get them.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare and receiving the brush heads just as I needing them was quite timely, just great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for replacing my Diamond Clean brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;There are some Diamond Clean brush heads on sale around my local area, but they are all white, so Amazon is only place where I can buy black ones.&lt;br /&gt;They work perfectly with my Diamond Clean brushes. 2 brush heads last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe it and problem solved.</li>
    <li> I already have a white Sonicare Diamond Clean and am very pleased with it based on my dentist&#x27;s comments (your teeth and gums look great).  I bought the black version too and its very striking.</li>
    <li> Great brush. great system. I replaced the old brush and could really feel the difference.  A very good system indeed.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product from Sonicare that has exceeded my expectations on cleaning my teeth while taking good care of my gums.</li>
    <li> This Feels better than going to get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. I would highly reccomed this to anyone.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.. I love my Sonic Diamond. You will not be disappointed in this brush head..</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush system, it is pricey, but clean teeth and whiter teeth is the end result</li>
    <li> Well this is the brush head that comes with my toothbrush(black). I love it, it&#x27;s soft and small enough to brush in the back of my teeth.</li>
    <li> My sonicare has been super helpful for a long time so it just figures that I would be needing replacement brush heads.</li>
    <li> Purchased for gift for boyfriend &amp; he loves it!</li>
    <li> Works great and a very nice color. Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Great! A very nice product! Love it! You can buy it that will not regret! Very good product for sure!</li>
    <li> These little brushes do a nice job but they are over priced!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Sonicare tooth bushes</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Will be replacing heads as usual every 3-6 months.</li>
    <li> perfect fit to my Phillips toothbrush</li>
    <li> Cleans your teeth really well. But the bristles aren&#x27;t built to last that long. It will easily spread if you apply more pressure during brushing, causing you to have to replace it quite often.</li>
    <li> You get several 2-pack packages for this price.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush on the market but expensive everywhere you look.  Essentially same price here as everywhere else.</li>
    <li> Genuine product. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> Really good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Got the Sonicare Diamong toothbrush about a year ago.  Best toothbrush that I have used for cleaning and helping to whiten teeth.  Dental check-ups have improved and I believe a result of this toothbrush.  Replacement brushes are excellent but cost is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Great product.... good price</li>
    <li> Not much to say here.  OEM heads for the best toothbrush on the planet.</li>
    <li> Quality, design and effectiveness is unsurpassed. This is my 3rd Sonicare purchase in 15 years and each one exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> great price and came quickly and nice to have a extra laying around.</li>
    <li> Great quality,.. very very costly for two tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Favorite tooth brush !  Delivers results just as it claims.  Worth every penny</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my sister.  She has told me that she loves the toothbrush.  Her teeth feel really clean and fresh.  Is it very cool looking, takes up little room in her bathroom.</li>
    <li> Man, these things are firm!  Why?  I would give up a month or two of usage to have softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t pay attention to the colors.  I use them until they no longer work as needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but expensive and the black is a third more expensive then the regular white expensive one. Another great product is Oral B and the brush heads are way cheaper.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is awesome and cleans my teeth better than a manual tooth brush. I like the black finish on this tooth brush I hope I do not have problems find black replacement heads in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great subscribe and save product!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Kind of expensive but it&#x27;s worth it for that extra clean feeling.  It shipped quickly and in nice packaging.</li>
    <li> So glad accessories were available.  Recommend purchasing the brush heads when purchasing the electric toothbrush so they&#x27;re conveniently stocked when replacement is necessary.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly onto my Phillips Diamond Clean toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These work as advertised. Pricey though.</li>
    <li> Best automatic toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.  Good plaque &amp; stain control.  I like the travel case design.  Good job, Philips!  Winner.</li>
    <li> Great fits perfectly on my Sonicare premium toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great product, good price</li>
    <li> Totally love it . My first time with these an glad I got it!!! Teeth feel dentist clean every time!!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever!</li>
    <li> These are excellent brushes, however, they are egregiously expensive and there is no alternative I know of. It is recommended that they be replaced monthly, which is the same as buying an extremely expensive toothbrush every month. I cannot believe the cost of production justifies the cost to the customer. My cynical side believes that Phillips has found a way to inflate their profit by selling lots of these. A fair profit is a good thing--taking advantage of a captive market by gouging them is not. Shame on you, Phillips!</li>
    <li> The absolute best toothbrush head ever. Top of the line for SonicCare. Worth every penney, and your annual tooth cleaning and check-up at your dentist will validate that statement for you!</li>
    <li> Great product that is hard to find locally, lower price and very fast shipping.  My second order and will order again.</li>
    <li> The last brush head that I used was on for wayyyy too long since it started to make my toothbrush sound like a lawnmower. The new heads helped.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned and great prices on Amazon.  We own the white and black brush - wish they offered in the larger pack like the white ones I find, but I should have assumed that when purchasing the limited edition color.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare in black and the only place I can find the diamond brush heads is at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is excellent product just as advertised.  It was sold for a great price and delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> I love these but I grabbed the wrong color by mistake</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and have been working great.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sonicare Black Diamond edition.  Very, very nice compared to my old Sonicare.  It was pricey ($190), but it works great and comes with multiple charging methods, lasts two weeks between charges, has about 6 different cycles, etc.</li>
    <li> I can really feel the difference using this head over my old sonicare one! My mouth feels so clean!</li>
    <li> Excellent device to clean your teeth.Easy to clean. I would recommend this device to anyone who wants clean and healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> Works great. Bought some cheaper brush heads before the official ones and they didn&#x27;t work out. Definitely go with the official replacements.</li>
    <li> great quality brush refills.</li>
    <li> Hay This really works.  Great  buy and  l LOVE the  results.</li>
    <li> Work great and inexpensive</li>
    <li> Love this brush ! This company has perfect quality brushes for the diamond series. I have the Sonicare  Black Diamond edition and these fit perfectly to them. I have to order them in bulky seen one brush head last about 4 months, which is not bad at all. You get two in a pack which is perfect, and you can storage them any where since they each come with a protective cap to help keep them in shape, from getting damaged and for drying as well. These will last a long time! If you need to stretch these out a few more days, like if you are traveling. I found sticking them in very hot water then placing the cap back on to dry the bristles will form back to normal.</li>
    <li> I need them so I bought them, but the tooth brush is awesome</li>
    <li> All my relatives in Mississippi are jealous of how clean my tooth is.</li>
