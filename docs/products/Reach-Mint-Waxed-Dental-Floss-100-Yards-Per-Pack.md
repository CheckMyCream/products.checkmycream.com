      <li>Happy to be able to get it so efficiently through Amazon</li>
      <li>Now I can have a handy box of dental floss</li>
      <li>My dentist told me a handy hint on the use of floss.  </li>
      <li>This item is exactly as described - great deal for purchasing 5 at once rather than one at a time.</li>
      <li>The perfect dental floss with enough length not to run out often and the strength not to break apart and leave strands in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

      <li>The floss is nice and strong and the wax provides a nice smooth action.</li>
      <li>Not much more to say, arrived on time and in good order and a great price.</li>

      <li>Still, not bad.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and very quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Came in good condition and as expected</li>
      <li>More and more studies tie heart and overall health to healthy gums and daily flossing.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are closely set together and the waxed floss slides right in between my teeth, extracting all the particles.  </li>
      <li>Standard J&amp;J dental floss, in a large size and handy</li>
      <li>I purchased because it was the cheapest per yard, but definitely would have been worth it to buy a better product.</li>
      <li>I bought these in an effort to be more environmentally conscious, I forgot how much the string breaks though.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping , quality product !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it really cleans in between my teeth very well.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>even though it&#x27;s thinner, it doesn&#x27;t slide between my teeth as easily as the other floss I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
      <li>I normally use glide floss.</li>
      <li>More floss in each container meaning less chance for me to run out!</li>
      <li>The boxes of floss came quickly and were as expected.</li>
      <li>Children should be taught to do this at an early age so they can carry on the brush/floss habit through their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mean, what more can you say about dental floss?</li>
      <li>ever if you&#x27;ve tiny gaps in teeth, breaks and frays very easily, barely &#x27;waxed&#x27;</li>

<li> some unknown reason retailers in my area do not stock this product.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s so rough that it makes me cringe.</li>
<li> As so often your hands are wet when flossing, he suggested to tie a knot into a longer length of floss (a knot like is tied in sewing thread).  </li>
<li> Exactly as expected</li>
<li> but it is certainly not over powering.  </li>
<li> It seems to have much less wax too, so</li>
<li> This is a little thicker so its stronger and slightly mint flavored.</li>
<li> Food particles between teeth generate bacteria, destroying gums and therefore the teeth.  </li>
<li> Reach floss may be less expensive, but it&#x27;s not a better value because of its low quality.  </li>
<li> The floss also splits into strings much easier than the other brand, which is a bit annoying.  </li>
<li> No more &amp;#34</li>
<li> With the small space I have in between my teeth</li>
<li> Worse floss</li>
<li> If the other stuff you use is breaking on you, or cutting the blood flow in your finger or cutting the flesh of your finger, switch to this floss.</li>
<li> It feels horrible on my teeth.</li>

    <li> Items were delivered on time and as described; thanks for a smooth sale!</li>
    <li> My favorite floss. Doesn&#x27;t fray like most.</li>
    <li> We love the product and the flavor.  We put one in each of our bathrooms so its easier for everbody. No more &amp;#34; Mom! Where is the dental fuss?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product.  I like Johnson &amp; Johnson products, so this is just another product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Reach floss may be less expensive, but it&#x27;s not a better value because of its low quality.  It&#x27;s thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it really cleans in between my teeth very well.  It seems to have much less wax too, so even though it&#x27;s thinner, it doesn&#x27;t slide between my teeth as easily as the other floss I&#x27;d been using.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize these are much bigger than the ones I get at grocery stores! More floss in each container meaning less chance for me to run out!</li>
    <li> Totally happy with the product - have tried many different brands this surpasses all.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Came on time and an excellent size.</li>

    <li> I bought these in an effort to be more environmentally conscious, I forgot how much the string breaks though. Still, not bad.</li>
    <li> My favorite dental floss. Please keep making it.</li>
    <li> If you are concerned with your dental health, do not hesitate to buy this product. It&#x27;s the best for its price and ability to clean well in between teeth.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I normally use glide floss. My wife got this from the orthdontist and it&#x27;s so rough that it makes me cringe. It feels horrible on my teeth. It reminds me of the sound of a nail scratching a chalk board.</li>
    <li> Ive tried a bunch of different brands and none of them compare with Johnson &amp; Johnson. With the small space I have in between my teeth I found this one to be a perfect size and strength.</li>
    <li> only four units shipped...one must have fallen out in the warehouse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as any you can buy.</li>
    <li> Good price and I won&#x27;t be running out of floss for a while.  Basically same as off or store brand item at same price.</li>
    <li> The perfect dental floss with enough length not to run out often and the strength not to break apart and leave strands in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some unknown reason retailers in my area do not stock this product.  Happy to be able to get it so efficiently through Amazon</li>
    <li> so far good. little thin but ok.</li>
    <li> Very good product at a good price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good - I mean, what more can you say about dental floss?</li>
    <li> Product as described. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Worse floss ever if you&#x27;ve tiny gaps in teeth, breaks and frays very easily, barely &#x27;waxed&#x27;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s floss...works like it should.</li>
    <li> Great product! A big improvement over competitive products. Greatly improves teeth hygiene.</li>
    <li> Its floss what do you expect</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> The review is for the 5-pack sold by &amp;#34;DaintyDeals&amp;#34; and fulfilled by Amazon prime. I got 5 individually sealed single packs. They are identical to those sold at local supermarkets.</li>
    <li> Good floss and a great value here on amazon.  This is a little thicker so its stronger and slightly mint flavored.</li>
    <li> More and more studies tie heart and overall health to healthy gums and daily flossing.  Food particles between teeth generate bacteria, destroying gums and therefore the teeth.  All of this is directly related to heart disease.  Along with a good regimen of brushing it is also imperative to floss daily.  Children should be taught to do this at an early age so they can carry on the brush/floss habit through their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that Reach Mint Waxed floss does the best job of between the teeth cleansing.  My teeth are closely set together and the waxed floss slides right in between my teeth, extracting all the particles.  My dentist told me a handy hint on the use of floss.  As so often your hands are wet when flossing, he suggested to tie a knot into a longer length of floss (a knot like is tied in sewing thread).  Then when flossing, slowly go around the loop, always flossing with a new area of the thread.  Put your hands inside the loop and use only one thickness.  I find that I can hold the floss taught and I don&#x27;t carry the particles removed to another tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the minty flavor but it is certainly not over powering.  The floss is nice and strong and the wax provides a nice smooth action.</li>
    <li> Best purchase this week!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
