### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>just great!</li>
      <li>Great hair color!</li>
      <li>Great hair dye !</li>
      <li>Gorgeous!</li>
      <li>This color is just beautiful on her.</li>
      <li>It turned out beautifully.</li>
      <li>After toning it, it still wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>I use this hair color for the 1st time this May still looking great.</li>
      <li>Color coverage is great.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled!</li>
      <li>The formula is very good and not drying, but I have auburn/graying hair and wanted to lighten it so that the white/gray blend better while growing out.  </li>
      <li>When I am done my hair is evenly colored and feels better than before I applied the color, my own hair dresser said it is one of the best home dye jobs she has ever seen.</li>
      <li>have fair skin (I am an Autumn, if that helps anyone picture my coloring) with ruddy undertones.</li>
      <li>I will still use Loreal&#x27;s hairspray, with the finest sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the ammonia fumes, from Loreal&#x27;s haircoloring, is SO overpowering, it surely cannot be good to breath it, burning my eyes, nasal and respiratory track.  </li>
      <li>no hint of Rose</li>
      <li>(But, Nutriese does not have any Medium Rose Gold</li>
      <li>It was a perfect shade of blonde-very natural looking.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it to have a great summer color.</li>
      <li>Also seems to be more hair loss than with the others.  </li>
      <li>Love the color, love the product.</li>
      <li>This color is perfect and looks just like on the box - kind of a light rosy blonde.</li>
      <li>, however many of the colors looks too yellow/goldish.</li>
      <li>On my non-grey hair, the color was okay --</li>
      <li>but blonde is the best for me</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair but my hair is lighter on the top of my head</li>
      <li>I love this color and don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this color in my local stores, and it is perfect for my hair and complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was price reasonably for an item that seems be very popular.</li>
      <li>I never would have thought that a rose blonde would look so beautiful</li>
      <li>The product was easy to apply and not messy/drippy and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>and it does have a strong smell which my husband hates.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much rose color in it, which is good, actually.  </li>
      <li>My favorite color delivered right to my door!</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly!</li>
      <li>She has light brown, chemically highlighted hair.  </li>
      <li>Quite unique.</li>
      <li>nothing special that I could see --</li>
      <li>Loreal Preference 8RG rose-gold is a beautiful color, not brassy, not orange, not pink, but a soft warm and natural look.  </li>
      <li>This one has an excellent balance of blonde and strawberry blonde hints without an overly brassy look.</li>
      <li>I was lucky that none of the containers inside didn&#x27;t get puncher &amp; leaked.</li>
      <li>Loyal customer here.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; component is mild, and could be &amp;#34;beefed up a bit&amp;#34; for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so my hair was in very healthy condition prior to use.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t color my whole head, just large streaks underneath the top layer to avoid retouching my roots.</li>
      <li>The Rose gold descriptor is the key with the emphasis on the Rose (read as red).</li>
      <li>I love how it blends with my natural color.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m puzzled that this color is an 8 rather than a 9 since its so light, I like it better than any of the blonde shades</li>
      <li>I am giving this 8RG rose gold color 5 stars for the color proposed, WITHOUT HAVING GREY HAIR.  </li>
      <li>i wanted color in my blonde and this was perfect, not pink, not red and not orange.</li>
      <li>Its just a nice bright blonde, not too golden and not too ashy, at least on my hair.</li>
      <li>I put this Rose Gold Blonde dye over top of that bleach hoping to make it a little more natural looking.</li>
      <li>is a very stubborn color to get out, even with nonpermanent color!</li>
      <li>I just tried this color for the first time today</li>
      <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it had done much of anything</li>
      <li>So, I am considering changing to Nutriese Garnieir products, without the ammonia fumes, and better grey coverage.  </li>
      <li>It was an absolutely even, rosy gold shade.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Just a light shade of strawberry blonde.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>So I am bummed out because I really like this color...</li>
      <li>I really hope it works, or I will be discontinuing Loreal haircoloring products.  </li>
      <li>I found it very complimenting for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>but it really does.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go to an ash blonde as my natural color is much more of a gold.</li>
      <li>Result was a nice soft gold blonde with the slightest touch of red.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this particular shade in stores so when I found it online</li>
      <li>This is very close to my natural hair color in the summer</li>
      <li>anyway if you have very sensitive skin you may want to avoid this one.</li>
      <li>I am planning on growing out my natural color now, but if that ends up not being such a pretty shade at age 32 now...</li>
      <li>After letting that fade a bit through washings, I became impatient and bleached my hair from light coppery orange back to blonde (used L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>desired this color so much, I order several month&#x27;s supply.  </li>
      <li>I will note that my hair was fully natural underneath the Manic Panic</li>
      <li>I am just trying to warn anyone who may be thinking she&#x27;ll have grey coverage and a pretty color.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;oreal Preference Paris Couture Hair Color in Rose Gold Blonde (8RG), dyed my hair evenly and without an atrocious smell; but I was hoping for more of a reddish hue.</li>
      <li>(Maybe, I&#x27;ll try experimenting in mixing a touch of red with Nutriese&#x27;s medium golden blonde.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for just the right blonde shade and thought maybe a honey blonde</li>
      <li>It covers grey fairly well or at least they blend into the blonde.</li>
      <li>Also, it was a falsehood for my mother, after multiple attempts with various Loreal Preference colors, and having tried leaving it on for a torturous full 45-50 extended minuties to cover grey hair, as directed..</li>
      <li>I have used ONLY L&#x27;Oreal hair color for 30+ years, and have never had ANY problems (aside from trying to use a gold on top of an &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; blonde which &#x3D; green, but never mind that.)</li>
      <li>A very soft, romantic color.</li>
      <li>I have naturally strawberry blonde hair but am going grey fast.</li>
      <li>(well, the last time I saw my natural color -- about 13 years ago!)  </li>
      <li>normal with bleach, it turned my hair a yellowy blonde with some remnants of orange as red</li>
      <li>Sadly, my white / grey hair, at the roots, and along the hairline by my face REMAINS GREY AND WHITE (for the last (3) three months of repeated extended times worth of coloring,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I shampoo my hair every other day) and have very curly and coarse hair, so that could have played a part.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually my hair processed a lighter color than shown, possibly because I have about 25% grey, along with &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34; deep mousie blonde natural hair.  </li>

<li> the &amp;#34;Ardell&#x27;s&amp;#34; grey drop additive for all haircoloring.  </li>
<li> A few weeks prior I had tried a strawberry blonde shade, same brand, and it didn&#x27;t hold, at all.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair auburn for years, but I have so much gray now that auburn is not sustainable, so I&#x27;ve slowly been phasing the auburn out.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does tend to dry my long color treated hair, so before I spread the color through the rest off my hair after the roots are done, I put conditioner on the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
<li> This is not exactly a strawberry blonde, but closer to a pale honey blonde with just a smidge of red.</li>
<li> I had been coloring my hair a dark shade of red by Manic Panic for about a year.</li>
<li> I have dark blonde to medium brown hair.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t dry out my hair even after the bleach, which I impatiently used the same day.</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve used every other L&#x27;oreal hair color product with very little irritation: Feria, Dream Blonde, Excellence, the regular Preference line.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gorgeous! This is very close to my natural hair color in the summer (well, the last time I saw my natural color -- about 13 years ago!)  I had been coloring my hair a dark shade of red by Manic Panic for about a year. After letting that fade a bit through washings, I became impatient and bleached my hair from light coppery orange back to blonde (used L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As normal with bleach, it turned my hair a yellowy blonde with some remnants of orange as red is a very stubborn color to get out, even with nonpermanent color! After toning it, it still wasn&#x27;t great. I put this Rose Gold Blonde dye over top of that bleach hoping to make it a little more natural looking. I didn&#x27;t want to go to an ash blonde as my natural color is much more of a gold. This didn&#x27;t bring out awful red/orange tones like many gold-based hair dyes can do. It was an absolutely even, rosy gold shade. Highly recommended! Didn&#x27;t dry out my hair even after the bleach, which I impatiently used the same day. I will note that my hair was fully natural underneath the Manic Panic so my hair was in very healthy condition prior to use. Definitely recommended. I am planning on growing out my natural color now, but if that ends up not being such a pretty shade at age 32 now...I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this shade!</li>
    <li> Love the color, love the product. It was shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> I have naturally strawberry blonde hair but am going grey fast. For years any product I have tried either just turned my hair red and brassy or blonde and ashy. This one has an excellent balance of blonde and strawberry blonde hints without an overly brassy look. It covers grey fairly well or at least they blend into the blonde. When I am done my hair is evenly colored and feels better than before I applied the color, my own hair dresser said it is one of the best home dye jobs she has ever seen. My only complaints are not many places stock it and it does have a strong smell which my husband hates.</li>
    <li> If you have any red in your hair, do not use this color.  The formula is very good and not drying, but I have auburn/graying hair and wanted to lighten it so that the white/gray blend better while growing out.  The Rose gold descriptor is the key with the emphasis on the Rose (read as red).</li>
    <li> Great hair color! I have been every color but blonde is the best for me and now I wanted a blonde with color and this is it. I have medium brown hair but my hair is lighter on the top of my head so it looks like I have highlights. i wanted color in my blonde and this was perfect, not pink, not red and not orange. Just a light shade of strawberry blonde. I know I will have to do it every 3 weeks because red hair colors fade the fastest but it is worth it to have a great summer color.</li>
    <li> This color has been hard to find. It lasts 8 weeks. I love how it blends with my natural color.</li>
    <li> Loreal Preference 8RG rose-gold is a beautiful color, not brassy, not orange, not pink, but a soft warm and natural look.  The &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; component is mild, and could be &amp;#34;beefed up a bit&amp;#34; for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually my hair processed a lighter color than shown, possibly because I have about 25% grey, along with &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34; deep mousie blonde natural hair.  I am giving this 8RG rose gold color 5 stars for the color proposed, WITHOUT HAVING GREY HAIR.  Sadly, my white / grey hair, at the roots, and along the hairline by my face REMAINS GREY AND WHITE (for the last (3) three months of repeated extended times worth of coloring,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loreal&#x27;s claim for 100% grey coverage is a falsehood, for me.

I really hope it works, or I will be discontinuing Loreal haircoloring products.  I will still use Loreal&#x27;s hairspray, with the finest sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the ammonia fumes, from Loreal&#x27;s haircoloring, is SO overpowering, it surely cannot be good to breath it, burning my eyes, nasal and respiratory track.  So, I am considering changing to Nutriese Garnieir products, without the ammonia fumes, and better grey coverage.  (But, Nutriese does not have any Medium Rose Gold color,......yet).  (Maybe, I&#x27;ll try experimenting in mixing a touch of red with Nutriese&#x27;s medium golden blonde. (?)</li>
    <li> My 15-year-old wanted to dye her hair, chose this and we did it yesterday evening. It turned out beautifully. She has light brown, chemically highlighted hair.  When she was a toddler it was a medium blonde. This color is just beautiful on her. A very soft, romantic color. Not brassy. Not platinum. I never would have thought that a rose blonde would look so beautiful but it really does. Quite unique. I hope this color is not discontinued.</li>
    <li> I just tried this color for the first time today and I really like it. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair auburn for years, but I have so much gray now that auburn is not sustainable, so I&#x27;ve slowly been phasing the auburn out. I&#x27;ve been looking for just the right blonde shade and thought maybe a honey blonde, however many of the colors looks too yellow/goldish. This color is perfect and looks just like on the box - kind of a light rosy blonde. The product was easy to apply and not messy/drippy and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering. I will continue to use this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this color in my local stores, and it is perfect for my hair and complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin (I am an Autumn, if that helps anyone picture my coloring) with ruddy undertones. Some hair color with red tones can look brassy, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;My grays turn out as lighter strands of hair, giving this color a multi-dimensional effect.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a full month, at least, or until my roots drive me crazy, without losing color and shine.&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to dry my long color treated hair, so before I spread the color through the rest off my hair after the roots are done, I put conditioner on the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works just great!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m puzzled that this color is an 8 rather than a 9 since its so light, I like it better than any of the blonde shades I&#x27;ve used previously.  I don&#x27;t see much rose color in it, which is good, actually.  Its just a nice bright blonde, not too golden and not too ashy, at least on my hair.</li>
    <li> I was appalled at the fact that, after using this kit as directed, I was left with grey -- no, white, roots!! I should have realized that &amp;#34;translucent color&amp;#34; in this case, was transparent! I have used ONLY L&#x27;Oreal hair color for 30+ years, and have never had ANY problems (aside from trying to use a gold on top of an &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; blonde which &#x3D; green, but never mind that.) On my non-grey hair, the color was okay -- nothing special that I could see -- but oh my gosh!! I was so looking forward to getting rid of my grey roots, and was horrified that I&#x27;d have to go out and about like that until I could re-color. I am just trying to warn anyone who may be thinking she&#x27;ll have grey coverage and a pretty color. This was NOT what happened to me. I am still going to only use L&#x27;Oreal, but never anything described as &amp;#34;translucent.&amp;#34; Except maybe lip color . . .</li>
    <li> Great hair dye ! Does not irritate my scalp like others. Color coverage is great. Color lasts me a month. Loyal customer here.</li>
    <li> My favorite color delivered right to my door!</li>
    <li> My goal with this color was to cancel out the green tinge I had from using ash blonde once too often, and it did do that.  Result was a nice soft gold blonde with the slightest touch of red.  Covered all grays too (am about 10% gray).  BUT--extreme scalp irritation!  And I&#x27;ve used every other L&#x27;oreal hair color product with very little irritation: Feria, Dream Blonde, Excellence, the regular Preference line.  It&#x27;s 3 days later and my scalp is still irritated.  Also seems to be more hair loss than with the others.  So I am bummed out because I really like this color...anyway if you have very sensitive skin you may want to avoid this one.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it would be a pinkish blonde, but it just blonde color no hint of Rose what so ever.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this particular shade in stores so when I found it online I was thrilled! I didn&#x27;t color my whole head, just large streaks underneath the top layer to avoid retouching my roots. The product arrived on time but the box was damaged and looked like it had been sitting under a leaky sink. I looked through the contents and everything was there so I decided to go ahead and try it. I followed all of the instructions and everything you&#x27;re supposed to do before coloring. I have dark blonde to medium brown hair. At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it had done much of anything but once my hair was dry the next morning you could see the color. However, this lasted about a day. It&#x27;s already faded and gone. I workout and shower just about every day (I shampoo my hair every other day) and have very curly and coarse hair, so that could have played a part. A few weeks prior I had tried a strawberry blonde shade, same brand, and it didn&#x27;t hold, at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed as this is the only brand I can find that carries &amp;#34;Rose Gold&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use this hair color for the 1st time this May still looking great. It was a perfect shade of blonde-very natural looking. I found it very complimenting for my skin tone. Others must feel the same because this shade can because it&#x27;s very hard to find; that&#x27;s why I turned to Amazon. Once in a while I will find it @ a store-usually when I am NOT looking for it-go figure. Packaging-it should of been in a shipping box proper because it will get crushed in a complex-apt. mail box-small. I was lucky that none of the containers inside didn&#x27;t get puncher &amp; leaked. Other than that complaint; it came in a timely manner. It was price reasonably for an item that seems be very popular.</li>
    <li> Convenient delivery of a product I sometimes have difficulty finding locally.  I love this color and don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal Preference Paris Couture Hair Color in Rose Gold Blonde (8RG), dyed my hair evenly and without an atrocious smell; but I was hoping for more of a reddish hue. This is not exactly a strawberry blonde, but closer to a pale honey blonde with just a smidge of red.</li>
