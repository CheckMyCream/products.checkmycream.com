<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CASE!! I have a TON of make up and brushes and this case fits it all - with room to spare! Beautiful case, well made, just wonderful!</li>
    <li> It is Awesome! I may need a bigger one  but for right now it is what I need. It&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
    <li> Daughter LOVED it.  She goes to vintage photo shoots and needed something large enough to hold all her cosmetics. This fit the bill. Soft pink case  appears well built and color is soft and attractive.</li>
    <li> This is a definitely a professional make-up case! My teenage daughter and I LOVE it! It is sturdy, well made and not flimsy. We compared this to the make-up trains that Ulta carries and wow, what a difference! Ulta&#x27;s cases were the same price but poorly made in comparison to this one. Yes, you pay more but it is worth it! This case was the larger size and it is big. Yet, you can also purchase the smaller size. I plan to get the smaller one for brushes as a birthday gift. It is AMAZING! If you are a serious make-up person, make-up professional or someone in theater or dance, this is a must purchase! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  So do I!!!  All of her make up is one place and ready to go.  The case is beautiful!  This case could be used for almost anything.</li>
    <li> I bought this case as a birthday gift for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a large carrying capacity and comes with a lock.&lt;br /&gt;The hinges seem durable enough to last through some use and I have not noticed any flaws with this case</li>
    <li> This makeup box is really pretty and its big but mine has some marks on it.</li>
    <li> I have recently expanded my makeup collection and I finally busted out of all the bathroom cabinets so my husband purchased me this! I took hours deciding which one I wanted, we looked at tool boxes, other beauty boxes, etc and we finally settled on this one! I am so happy with this box. It fit&#x27;s all of my things(we&#x27;re talking 4 blushes, a few different primers, many chapsticks and lipsticks, 2 foundations, my huge coastal scents palettes,All my eye products, and hair things, all my brushes(i have like 3 sets) and so much more more!) Even with all that there is still room to spare!&lt;br /&gt;This also held up under the sink even when we had a leak!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this item, loved it, the style, size, it was great!! but it was beyond damaged, it had a lot of scratches, lots of dents on the sides. the pink cover on one corner was coming off! did return it and replaced order hopefully this one is not damaged!! fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> It is too small for me</li>
    <li> Love this case, it&#x27;s the perfect size to fit my cosmetic and skincare products neatly and attractively. I would definitely recommend this - I may get a second!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these train cases for my teenage daughters for Christmas. They are wonderful at keeping them organized. No more arguing about whose make-up is whose. I got the pink rose case for one and the silver industrial for the other.</li>
    <li> I just got mines today and i love it.... sooo big is perfect and beautiful. I read some of the reviews how it falls apart, and i was a little nervous. Hopefully mine dont fall apart</li>
    <li> Love this case. Holds all my makeup and face lotions with plenty of room left.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated.  Large size, works well for the intended use.</li>
    <li> Bought this case for my daughter who has a ton of makeup! She absolutely loves this case! Perfect for her needs.</li>
    <li> Works good very spacious and keeps all must stuff nice and organized .</li>
    <li> Love it, I use it for all my dog&#x27;s collars, bling, bandana&#x27;s and id tags.  It holds a lot of things and opens up beautifully to display all inside.</li>
    <li> Was great until the bottom fell out.... Broke after a few months.</li>
    <li> Best train case I have ever found. When I got it I was surprised at how big it was.  Love it !</li>
    <li> This is larger than you think and very well made. My daughter shows horses eastern style so she must be perfectly presented as does her Saddlebred. There is enough room for both her and horse supplies for styling(ribbon, clips, studs for horse mane). Holding up well with lots of abuse in the stall.</li>
    <li> amazing case worth the money, wonderful service great seller</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful case. Very roomy and large. It fits my needs. I did not buy it for travel but for storage. It makes it so easy to find just what I want and not be rooting around for 10 minutes. Keeps my makeup in pristine shape too. Very well made.</li>
    <li> Handle was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN WANTING THIS MAKE UP TRAIN CASE 4EVER! NOW I HAVE ONE &amp; I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It is a nice strong case for anything make-up, manicuring carry supply case, anything beauty.  I wish it  was a bit deeper.  Nicely lined, very durable.</li>
    <li> Got it for my girlfriend and she loves it. Tons of space. She does her own nails and all that fits in there. With some face stuff and 3 brushes and a bunch of other little things there.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME. For one thing it gorgeous, it looks more pink in person, and it is about twice the size I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;Normally train cases are around $30-$60 and they are small, but this one is pretty big, like twice the size of most I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems reasonably well made, as good as any other train case I have seen. The pull out shelves are a little bit flimsy seeming, but this is true of any train case I have seen that is not like $400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome buy for the price, and super fab looking. I think I am going to give one to my BFF for her birthday!</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking case that holds a great deal of makeup. I had four makeup bags filled with makeup, so I bought this to consolidate and organize. It fits all of my makeup with ease, with plenty of room to spare. In addition to the main compartment, there are four small trays that fold out when the case is open. These were the right length for eyeliners (only one of my pencils was too long to fit in one of the small trays), eye crayons, lipsticks, etc. The main compartment is where I keep larger shadow palettes and pressed powders, as these are a little too bit for the four small trays. I still have tons of room for more stuff. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Product was exactly what I needed!! Strong and perfect for my cosmetics!</li>
    <li> A litller bigger than expected but i love it</li>
    <li> This makeup case is absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s much larger than I had anticipated but that&#x27;s not a problem for me. It shipped quickly and was packaged neatly. I can&#x27;t get over how pretty it is! The inside has many compartments that will fit all your makeup brushes and cosmetics. I&#x27;ve never had such an awesome case before. It&#x27;s so beautiful...AND it comes with a lock and keys! I can keep my toddler out of mommy&#x27;s stuff! This is an awesome gift for anyone who loves makeup!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great for a stationary position but I was carrying mine and dropped it and it kind of busted open. I still use it but I just try not to move it around as much.</li>
    <li> very cute and holds all of my make-up and brushes; however, the locks are very cheap!!!  If you are wanting it to lock to keep someone out, do not buy this case!  I am only trying to keep my 4 year old out and so far it works for that.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great product and even better price</li>
    <li> Even seeing the measurements, I was surprised/pleased with how big it is! I bought it for my 6 year old daughter to put her nail polish, lip gloss, earrings, necklaces, and there&#x27;s plenty of space.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday after finding out she needed a good box for her make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the quality of the box is very good, feels very sturdy and not fake. Very spacious on the inside. My girlfriend really likes the box, the only reason why i give it 3 stars is that the locks on the top of the box are quite useless. They provide no sense of security if that&#x27;s what you are looking for in this box. My 2 year old daughter was able to break into it while both sides were locked. Dont know if this is just the way the locks were designed or if i got defective locks on mine.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic case is beautiful but very large! It barely fit on my counter. Great for traveling but not so much for just using at home if you have a small bathroom, although is keeps your cosmetics so neat and organized. It is made extremely well for the price and is not cheap or flimsy. The pink is a very pretty light pink. I plan on exchanging it for the smaller one but otherwise it is a wonderful case.</li>
    <li> Too small and I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months and the shelves are already falling apart. Its not a good quality. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The box itself is bulky, which wouldn&#x27;t be that much of an issue if the interior compartments were a bit larger. The majority of makeup ended up loosely scattered in the main bottom compartment as the smaller sections couldn&#x27;t fit larger pieces (brushes, etc.). I wanted more organization, which is why I didn&#x27;t end up keeping the case.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it she organized her makeup</li>
    <li> Very poorly made. Came with dents and scratches all over. Compartments are very rigidly.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this make up case.  It&#x27;s larger than we thought it would be, but folds nicely and has lots of storage.  The only problem is it comes with two keys that don&#x27;t fit into the locks.  Just can&#x27;t figure that part out.  If you use this professionally and want to be able to lock it, this is not the right case for you.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, I liked the case initially because it held all my makeup and the inside is really nice with compartment that fit all my makeup and kept everything organized. However, after three days of using it at HOME not even traveling with it the locks stopped working and the handle came off. Very disappointed made with cheap material.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  A little more pink than I had anticipated but still love the color.  Roomier than expected also. Will be ordering another one in the future.</li>
    <li> Wonderful item and seller.  Item arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I exchanged it for the smaller size because 1. It wasn&#x27;t m as heavy and 2. This one didn&#x27;t have any long compartments to hold my brushes. Only squares for eyeshadow and tiny stuff.</li>
    <li> THIS IS HUGE!!! I just got this for my birthday, and while my interest in make up is mainly in the day to day this looks and feels like what someone would employ if they were a professional. Very well made and sturdy. The floral design is a part of the metal, not some cheap decal. I haven&#x27;t tried out the locking mechanism yet but it looks standard and non-complicated(deterrent/not fort knox).</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my sister. My sister is in LOVE with her makeup organizer!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute case! It has lots of room. HOWEVER, it is kind of flimsy and doesn&#x27;t close well on one side. I literally have to fight with it every time I close it. I would send it back, but I&#x27;m busy and don&#x27;t want to eat the shipping cost. Overall, I am disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a birthday present, it has a lot of room, great quality and fast shipping, she love it,was rreally happy.</li>
    <li> The case was gorgeous, well constructed, but it was way too big. I didn&#x27;t think 14&amp;#34; was that large when I read the description so I should&#x27;ve measured it out first or ordered the 10&amp;#34; but even that may have been too big for me. I purchased just for personal use. Not a professional makeup artist but I did love that the case had locks (similar to a diary lock) on both latches. Was hoping to use this so my kids wouldn&#x27;t have access to my makeup but as I said it was ginormous. It took up my entire vanity.</li>
    <li> Perfect case perfect size great seller perfect product</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a Pom Squad to carry their competition make-up in.  They love it!  It is the perfect size, very well made.  This girls are very happy with it.  Received it within 3 days, and free shipping!  Awesome......</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for her make-up she loved it.  She says ,nice and spacious.</li>
    <li> I love the size and the design. The shelves seem kind of rickety but haven&#x27;t broken or anything yet. The bottom is a little hard to keep organized and reach into. But...does the job of housing my make-up so...4 stars!</li>
    <li> The case interior was not designed for my preference.  It is quite heavy empty, so it would be too heavy for me so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Product had a beautiful design.  But I would not call this high quality professional.  Cheaply made exterior that more than likely will not last very long.  I paid a very high price with the assumption that this was a professional quality made item.  I would have gotten better with a Walmart brand.  Case appears larger when closed up than it actually is on the inside.  Small flimsy trays and a bar across the bottom that will make it difficult to acess makeup placed there.</li>
    <li> This case was exactly what I needed to put all my things together. I got exactly what I ordered.... Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Good construction.</li>
    <li> This was really pretty in real life.  I have no idea how it is holding up to daily use because I gave it as a gift, but when she opened it everyone was struck with how nice it looked!</li>
    <li> Got it in the pink color. Stunning! I was able to fit more in it than I had thought. Seems very well-made. Not too heavy either!</li>
    <li> Excellent product with lots of storage space for make up with fold out storage.  Got it for daughter-in-law and she loves it!</li>
    <li> beautiful and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Just received my 14\\&quot; pink makeup train and am very happy. It&#x27;s not only pretty, but exactly what I was looking for.  It is nice and spacious, and fits just about all the makeup I have. Great way to keep all your makeup organized and visually assess what you need to replace soon :-)  It is sturdy, and I love the fact that I can move it around as needed without fear of things falling out. YAY!</li>
    <li> Great for someone who has a lot of makeup that needs to organize their mess like I did. It also has a lot of room to store bigger items.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this makeup case.  It is well constructed, sturdy and has PLENTY of space for my makeup needs.  Mine has been abused, it is not kept on a vanity, it is transported often.  The one dislike I have is that none of the slots are long enough to hold long lip/brow pencils or extended makeup brush handles, so I keep a small soft case in the interior lower portion.  A regular size z palette fits inside, but oversized palettes do not.  It&#x27;s tricky to get UD vice palettes in it, it can be done but it takes maneuvering.  But that is the case with most any case I think.  Before using this I was using a toolbox with no compartments and this is definitely a luxurious upgrade.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful! came quick. Good shape. It is more then I could imagine. I feel the drawer shelf s are sturdy. Lots of room inside. The color is very pretty. Great for trips!! I love it!!I&amp;#34; m so glad I ordered it</li>
    <li> The case is ok , because its too dirty not very clean and look like someone used before, inside it broken too , can take look the pic !</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Nice size for me to store all my jamberry products and tote to parties. Durable and very pretty.</li>
    <li> This item has great quality it is big and fits a loth of things i love it looks really nice too the outer is very nice light pink i would recommend it worth the price .</li>
    <li> My wifes went bananas when she opened it. Loves it</li>
    <li> Beautiful case, but had a huge dent in it when I received it so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I luv love luv my cosmetic case! All 5 stars here. Very sturdy and has plenty of space. I am ordering another one now :)</li>
    <li> I love this case. It&#x27;s very sturdy and has plenty of room.</li>
    <li> OMG! my makeup has a home!!! its the perfect size too! it looks great!</li>
    <li> It was larger than I expected, which was great!  Love the color and the lock feature. The different compartments hold my brushes and most everything so that I&#x27;m organized in the morning and great for traveling.  Amazon&#x27;s delivery is the best, never a problem.  Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> This is beautiful and sturdy. My sister and I are taking a train ride next month and this will work wonderfully! I LOVE this!</li>
    <li> The size, color and overall quality of the box were as expected.  This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she really liked it.  The only glitch is the locking mechanism.  She had a hard time getting the key to turn properly to lock, but she eventually worked it out.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Started falling apart on first use.</li>
    <li> This item got here really fast. When i opened the box, i was pleasantly surprised by how big it was. Its way bigger than the picture. And i didnt even notice when i purchased it that it has a lock on it with keys included. It fit all of my 163 makeup items, and more. I was afraid from the look of the picture that the print on the outside would be cheap and chip off easily, but its actually conpletely solid. I love this product SO MUCH! and i definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVED this case  Great purchase.  Item received on time and in perfect condition</li>
