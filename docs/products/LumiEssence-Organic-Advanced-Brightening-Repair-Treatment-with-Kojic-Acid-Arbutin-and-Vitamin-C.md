<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think it works it feels soothing and I think would yield results if I applied the product and used it as many times as instructed. I will use it as recommended and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer along with other sweetsation products and let me start by saying that if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle product that will instantly transform your face...this is not it.  NOW if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy product with AWESOME and safe ingredients that will slowly but surely improve the appearance of your skin, then you should give sweetsation a try.  A lot of times as consumers we search for these so called miracle products which really don&#x27;t exist.  So realistically. the best thing to do is try a product over time and mark out your progress, seeing how your skin responds.  That is exactly what I did with sweetsation and I am convinced that these products are legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this moisturizer along with other products about 2 years ago and back then I noticed the change in my skin,  I am African American and my goal was not to lighten shades of my skin tone, but to decrease the appearance of dark spots and have an overall glow.  What I noticed back then was that my face definitely had a brighter, more glowing appearance and was just overall healthy.  The dark spots were slower to fade and I can understand why since I&#x27;ve had them for quite some time.  Overall, I was able to wear less makeup and that was a change that I could actually measure.  Not to mention that I could obviously see the change in my skin from pictures.  I used the products for a while but decided to stop ordering them due to financial reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I decided to start using sweetsation products again recently because I could TRULY see the difference in my skin from when I stopped using it.  I was getting more acne and it was again leaving marks.  My skin easily tanned and got discolored.  Overall, I missed having that healthy glow.  Health skin is important to me and I realize now that it is well worth the money to look in the mirror and see noticeable changes.  I do wish the prices were more affordable or that there were big sales every now and then but....you get what you pay for right?  I may have to budget in other areas but for me personally, it is well worth it and I will continue to be a sweetsation customer!ow and then but....you get what you pay for right?  I may have to budget in other areas but for me personally, it is well worth it and I will continue to be a sweetsation customer!</li>
    <li> I have a severe case of melasma on hard to treat South Asian skin. I have not had much success treating it! This product has helped even out the complexion a little more than most so that I am not quite as hesitant as I used to be to be seen without covering up the affected area.</li>
    <li> It appears to be working. Not sure how long before the age spots are completely GONE.</li>
    <li> Lumi*Essence Organic Skin Brightening Treatment claims to do a great many things for your face. The active ingredients in this product do sound as if they would at the very least be helpful in attaining some of these goals no matter what. The information taken from the product&#x27;s Amazon page is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Lumi*Essence Treatment is an Anti-Dark Spot Concentrate recommended for:&lt;br /&gt;Dark spots / Sun spots / Age spots / Freckles&lt;br /&gt;Uneven skin, Melazma&lt;br /&gt;Skin discolorations related to excessive sun exposure&lt;br /&gt;General skin luminocity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lumi*Essence Face visibly corrects freckles and dark spots caused by excessive and cumulative sun exposure and helps to even out skin tone overtime.  Contains Kojic Acid (helps lighten and reduce the appearance of dark spots), Alpha-Arbutin (derived from the leaves of cranberry, blueberry and bearberry shrubs.  Skin lightening agent that prevents conversion of pigment-forming enzymes) Papaya and Pineapple extract (provides intense exfoliation to help reduce the size and color intensity of dark spots and help even skin tone overtime).  Niacinamide has an inhibitory effect on the transfer of melanosomes to skin cells, thus it can interrupt the process that causes irregular pigmentation to form.  Milk thistle is an effective anti-oxidant aids in repair of uneven skin overtime.  Recommended use am and pm.  Application of sunscreen of at least SPF 30 is mandatory while using this (and any kind of sun damage repairing) product.Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;The appearance of dark spots and discoloration is visibly diminished&lt;br /&gt;Skin radiance is increased&lt;br /&gt;Skin complexion is more uniform&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, fast absorbing essence leaves skin fresh&lt;br /&gt;Artificial Fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;Non comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;Hydroquinone-free&lt;br /&gt;Safe for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Organic Aloe, Organic Sunflower Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Octyl Palmitate, Organic Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Cetyl Alcohol, Potassium Stearate, Organic Beeswax, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Alpha-Arbutin, Organic Kojic Acid, Rose Essential Oil, Tamanu Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Flax Seed Oil, Organic Evening Primrose Oil, Organic Rose Hip Oil, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Organic Goji Berry Fruit Extract, CoQ10, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Organic Reishi, Caviar Extract, Organic Green Tea, Pomegranate, Silk Protein Amino Acid, Organic Milk Thistle, Raspberry Seed Oil, Organic Cranberry, Organic Bayberry, Sandalwood Essential Oil, Helichrysum Essential Oil, Seabuckthorn Oil, Papaya, Pineapple Fruit Extract, Niacinamide, Pearl Powder, Lemon Essential Oil, Organic Rooibos Tea Extract, Silica, Allantoin, Organic Arnica, Organic Lavender, Organic Calendula, Organic Chamomile, Grape Seed Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;Recommended use: am and pm; preferably after exfoliating. Application of sunscreen of SPF 30 is mandatory while using this product. IMPORTANT: This product addresses sun damage related skin unevenness only. It may work best on light to medium skin colors. If you suspect that skin unevenness you have might be due to: hormonal imbalances, pregnancy, genetic skin coloring, injuries, inflammation, certain types of disease, or side effects of medication, consult your dermatologist prior to using.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for a week before I reviewed. I did see a real improvement in my basic skintone &amp; overall brightening. My skin did begin to look more luminous &amp; radiant. I believe I would have to use longer to see any of the other benefits but what I did see is great! As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. All thoughts &amp; opinions are mine &amp; mine alone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and have yet to see the spot for which I bought it do anything.  I think it has brightened the area around my spot.  Not sure I recommend this.  I do plan to finish the container since I spent the money on it.</li>
    <li> It is just a regular old cream with a rose scent. I were it religiously daily for a while now and my skin has not changed other than getting a couple breakouts a month, I never brokeout.</li>
    <li> I always give 5 stars to any skin care product because I have to wait for results to show. If I do not notice any changes in my skin tone or texture I will definitely lower it but anyways, I have been using this product for a few days now and I can&#x27;t wait to see it working for me! I have a lot of faith in this cream and know it will. The lotion is very rich and buttery and this informs you that you are definitely getting a high quality skin care product that will deliver promises. Please note that It won&#x27;t work alone of course so you will need a skin whitening/lightening bar and Labelle&#x27;s Skin Care makes excellent soaps which do exactly what it states it will but it&#x27;s very pricey at $20-40 but well worth it. Also, Kojie San&#x27;s dream white or pure kojic acid soap will work excellent with this lotion due to the fact it contains kojic acid too, vitamin c, plus vitamin e (which will help penetrate the product effectively into the skin). It may irritate or sting a bit when using the two products containing KA so I recommend if you are going to try kojic acid soap to only bathed with it for 3 days a week and using a milder soap for the other 4 days, vice versa. One thing you may not approve of is the fact it has a very strong herb/plant scent (which will make you hate applying this cream to your face) but it disappears within 10 minutes. I am sensitive to certain scents so I am trying to build tolerance when I use it on my face. The body size of the lotion is only 5 oz which is insane even though a little squirt goes a long way since it&#x27;s so rich and creamy but If you use it twice a day which is highly recommended for results, once in the morning and once at night, it won&#x27;t last very long. Using it twice will definitely give results so stock up on 2-3 bottles because 15 oz is the right size for using with the body. How I know this is because another whitener I used in the past was 16 oz and lasted me a month but 15-16 oz may last for longer if you are smart with applying the right amount. I wanted a cheaper alternative and thought this was it but It&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the other lotion I switched from which cost $90 for 16 oz so I will definitely have to use it wisely myself. 15 oz of this stuff will cost around $150 (3 bottles). Yikes! Anyways, here&#x27;s to hoping this works for me! I&#x27;ve used kojic acid in the past for my face and it always worked very well for me so I don&#x27;t think I will have any complaints within another week.he right amount.

    <li> Really loved this product! Did a whole blog post on it: beautyobsessions3.blogspot.com. The product is creamy, moisturizing, and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and no matter what skin products I am using at any time, my skin is always quite changeable and I never get consistent results. But the Lumi Essence kept my skin on an even keel; there was only slight evening out of skin tone, but there were no breakouts and no drying out. A nice product to add to a skin care regime. On my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product absorbs into my skin but I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it. I use it every night and haven&#x27;t seen a difference with brightening my skin. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it often enough. I can deal with the smell before I go to bed but not all day. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have mild hyper pigmentation that comes and goes - mostly with my period. I have good reason to believe that they are hormone induced. However, I am no expert in skin conditions and I&#x27;m not about to start explaining why my skin is so weird - it just is. I started using LumiEssence religiously for a few days now - just as my period started and I have the crazy pigmentations that plague me monthly. First off, I love how this product moisturizes my skin with no greasy residue. My hyper pigmentation may not be completely gone but I am starting to notice a significant change because they are not as &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ferociously pigmented&amp;#34; in comparison to how they looked like before I started using LumiEssence. I also absolutely love the fact that this product is organic and free of toxic ingredients. I already have sensitive skin to begin with, so I don&#x27;t need to add harsh chemicals in the equation. You should give this product a shot - it really is worth trying because with religious use, it delivers the results that it promises based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> This product did nothing to my face in terms of Brightening. I don&#x27;t know how and why people have over rated it. Might be white skinned people may used it and they may have thought that their skin was brightened but you are yellow or tan skin person then my personal stance is that it does nothing in terms of brightening and it is very pricy too. I would not buy it again, just a waste of money. Obagi nu derm clear 3 is much better than this and it worked for me but obagi is very pricy too. Hope this review might someone not to fall into over rated stuffs.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and a lot of chemical allergies and the sweetsation products don&#x27;t irritate my skin. The lumi*essence is one of my favorites. I use it at night however it can be used under make up too as it is not greasy. The best thing is that it works great ! All of my brown spots have faded and can no longer be seen !! My only complaint is the bottle. It is completely opaque and there&#x27;s no way to tell when you&#x27;re running low and need to order a new one.</li>
    <li> Being of a certain age, yeah ok..I am getting old! I have started seeing dark areas that my mother so lovingly calls &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;. Yeah.. not something I am thrilled to sport around shouting.. I&#x27;m old, I&#x27;m old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen ads for products and even talked to my doctor about what can be done. Some of the products available over the counter and through my doctor contain chemicals that I do not want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was approached to review this product, I was glad to see that it didn&#x27;t contain items that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce. The ingredients include: Purified Water, Organic Aloe, Organic Sunflower Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Octyl Palmitate, Organic Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Cetyl Alcohol, Potassium Stearate, Organic Beeswax, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Alpha-Arbutin, Organic Kojic Acid, Rose Essential Oil, Tamanu Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Flax Seed Oil, Organic Evening Primrose Oil, Organic Rose Hip Oil, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Organic Goji Berry Fruit Extract, CoQ10, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Organic Reishi, Caviar Extract, Organic Green Tea, Pomegranate, Silk Protein Amino Acid, Organic Milk Thistle, Raspberry Seed Oil, Organic Cranberry, Organic Bayberry, Sandalwood Essential Oil, Helichrysum Essential Oil, Seabuckthorn Oil, Papaya, Pineapple Fruit Extract, Niacinamide, Pearl Powder, Lemon Essential Oil, Organic Rooibos Tea Extract, Silica, Allantoin, Organic Arnica, Organic Lavender, Organic Calendula, Organic Chamomile, Grape Seed Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol,  and Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not sure what every one of these ingredients do, I am familiar with most of them and even use them in other products and beverages. I had already learned that kojic acid and alpha-arbutin were natural skin fading agents, so I was more than willing to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider my skin a medium tone. I do have mild hyper-pigmentation on my wrist/hands and face related to aging. I followed the directions of applying both morning and night and I have been using this product for several weeks. The product is easy to apply, smells nice with a very light scent that fades quickly. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results on brightening:  Only after a couple of days of using this product my skin began to look brighter as soon as the product was applied. After about a week, I noticed the area was consistently brighter and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results on reducing the discoloration: After two (2) weeks I do not notice any major change in the darker areas. Overall, the treated area is softer and the skin looks healthier, but the age spots are still there. Could they be a little lighter? Maybe, but not so much that I would purchase the product again as a lightening agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase it as a brightening and moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: After using this product for a couple of weeks, I did discover that &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; are not listed as one of the treatments to use this on. Knowing this now, I would still recommend this product for the brightening results and encourage those with sun damaged skin to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.ion on my wrist/hands and face related to aging.

    <li> It works, but I stopped using it. The smell of it, wasn&#x27;t that great.. other than that, it does work. Its just not on my favorites list to keep using it, ended up giving it away. It does improve coloration, and brightens my already white skin, but I have discoloration from not using sunscreen, acne and anything else really. so it was nice, but like I mentioned I have other products I preferred to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
    <li> I love this product. I saw a difference in my complexion the first day I used it. I am on my second order now. It has lightened up my existing brown spots. I am hoping with longer term and consistent use that they will get even lighter. Overall, I like how it evens out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have used other dark spot corrector serums which have stung, or caused a tingling.  Happily to report, this one does not bother my skin, and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling baby-skin soft, and smooth like vanilla ice cream. Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy, thick feel to it at all.  I am very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with its primary ingredient, Kojic Acid, it is a remedy for the treatment of pigment problems, and age spots. Discovered in 1989, kojic acid works similarly to hydroquinone. Kojic acid is derived from a fungus, and studies have shown that it is effective as a lightening agent, slowing production of melanin (brown pigment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily and acne-prone. I am 44 years old and have hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Lumi*Essence has helped fade the hyperpigmentation and acne scars, but it takes time and requires patience. It took about a year for the hyperpigmention to nearly fade. I use Alpha Hydrox 10% gel on my face, then I dampen my fingers and apply a pea-sized amount of Limi*Essence. The Lumi*Essence absorbs completely and gives my skin a pleasant tingling sensation. The greatest benefit of Lumi*Essence is that it is actually helping to heal my skin! The Alpha Hydrox was doing a great job of exfoliating, but the Lumi*Essence has reduced inflammation and cleared acne and blackheads. I had a number of deeply embedded blackheads that have cleared in the past month. I always loved the way Lumi*Essence gave my face--especially around my eyes, a general radiance, but now that it&#x27;s also healing my skin, I&#x27;m a life-long fan.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sweetsation Therapy Lumi*Essence for while now. I have light freckles, and 2 dime size sun spots on my cheek. I use this twice a day. I have noticed an all over evenness in my skin tone. My freckles are still there, but my complexion is brighter. This creme is thick, and it has a light sweet scent. It will not interfere with your perfume. It goes on light, not oily or greasy and it sinks into the skin well. I really like this product as it provides moisture to my skin as well. I really like it. Go to the website, do your research. I was impressed. I bet you will like it too. Plus, Sweetsation Therapy has a whole product line. The scents of their products are amazing. Although I got this product free for a review, I am currently still using it with success. You can find the whole review at http://krystlewv.blogspot.com #lumiessence #gotitfree #review</li>
    <li> I have some acne scars, but they are not very obvious, I used to put some BB cream to cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, and it can be absorbed very fast. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting that I put on this cream accidentally. I bought an Sweetsation product recently and it came in with two samples (usually they were their night cream samples). Then I checked the label on the bottom of one, it&#x27;s the night cream. One night (three or four days ago), I took the left over of the night cream sample which was not enough, then I opened another sample and took some of the cream out. I found the cream was light yellow (not as white as the night cream). Then I turned over, and found it&#x27;s this repair treatment. I thought probably it&#x27;s OK to use as a night cream...just one night. Then I put it on and went to sleep. When I looked into the mirror the next morning, I was surprised that the acne scars on both of my cheeks (under cheekbone) were very light, too light to see. And my skin tone was even! Then the next evening, I still used this as a night cream. Then yesterday, I thought that it didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a night cream, so probably I should use it during the daytime. What shall I do, I still have some Q&#x27;Lumiere cucumber Q10 day cream left, and I also love that day cream...</li>
    <li> I came across this product while googling for best skin care creams to use for brightening and night creams.  I have always had perfect skin but until recently, after the birth of my first child, I noticed that my skin condition started to change for the worse.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the hormones that are being changed within my body (because this can cause hyperpigmentation in some women), my lack of sleep, stressful lifestyle, I&#x27;m getting older, just turned 30, or all of the above.  But my once dewy perfect porcelain like complexion turned more red, more to prone to acne, noticeable blemishes, enlarged pores, puffy eyes, and my skin just looked dead.  I found this product being recommended on one of &amp;#34;the best skin care cream for brightening 2014&amp;#34; magazine article online.  Can&#x27;t remember the name of the article, but I&#x27;m sure you can find it if you just google around.&lt;br /&gt;I have read both the bad reviews and the good reviews for this product before purchasing.  And with all skin care products (which I have used MANY different brands, and some even costing over $100USD a bottle), I had realistic expectations for how the products may work on me and there is a possibility that it may not work on me.  I also have tried many higher end and more expensive products from Lancome, Shiseido, Clinique, etc... Some worked for me and some didn&#x27;t.  But those brands have chemicals in them that probably aren&#x27;t good for me to keep using forever.  And they are very expensive.  So I was looking for another alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT REVIEW: Bought item from Amazon.  Item came pretty quick.  I think it took about 5 days or less to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry sensitive skin and light complexion with a little bit of rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;First night using the cream, I put the Lumi*Essence brightening cream on first, then used the Lumi*Essence night cream afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Next morning, I didn&#x27;t break out at all.  Which was very surprising to me because most creams that I have used havecaused me to break out or make my skin feels stingy.  And this cream did not make my face feel stingy.  It looked oily when you first put it on but it my skin quickly absorbed most of it.  But even with some oil left on my face, I did not break out at all...which I was extremely happy about that.  And my face was very well moisturized the next morning.  A great moisturizer.  And I used about 3 pumps each bottle for each application.  Which is a lot of products for one session but I don&#x27;t care as long as it works.  I don&#x27;t know if I see a difference yet after the first time of use, but I didn&#x27;t break out and my skin felt moisturized.  I think my skin looked less tired.  And the creams both have a light scent to it.  I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, fast forward to about day 3 of use, I noticed that my complexion was lighter.  My skin looks way less tired and more alive.  Most of my redness is gone, just a light pink hue on my cheeks (which I like).  I still had some blemishes left but I&#x27;m sure those will go away more with further use of the products.  And on the third morning, while my husband was getting ready to go to work, I was still laying in the bed.  He looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Oh your skin looks a lot better and it looks good.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve heard my husband complimented on my skin for a very long time, at least since I was still pregnant.  Our baby is 1.5 years old.  My husband doesn&#x27;t even notice it or say anything to me when I get a new haircut and color.  So this is a major plus in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but now I&#x27;m a loyal customer and will be coming back for more and more.  I didn&#x27;t even expect this product to work at all, or if it did work, maybe mediocre.  But it sure does work and even better than my expectations of it.  So you should give this product a try.  It may or may not work on everyone but that is natural for all skin care products.  No one product ever works for everyone.  Some other reviewscomplained on price, but you can&#x27;t go cheap on skin care products.  You get what you pay for.  And this product costs way less than Lancome, Shiseido, Clinique, and other brand names products from Sephora.  So I will say this product is mid price range.  Not over the counter cheap, and not over $100 like many other name brands.  I&#x27;m just happy that this works.  And I am shopping for my next batch of products from this brand.  I&#x27;m going to try the day cream next.</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This repair treatment by Sweetsation Therapy arrived in a 2oz pump set to help with dark spots/discoloration/age spots/freckles and more. In time, this little pump will help to even out skin imperfections and the sun exposure that we find that stays on our skin and causes discoloration. The pump contains what they call Kojic acid, an ingredient that reduces dark spots and Alpha Arbutrin that is derived from the leaves of cranberry, blueberry and bearberry to lighten skin. Pineapple and Papaya help to exfoliate the skin. I love how this product incorporates the use of fruits that naturally help the skin. The pump should be used day and night and when applied it felt very light and non-greasy. The product is safe on sensitive skin and I loved how it did not have a strong fragrance odor to it. I found the bottle to be very pleasant on the outside as well, as product presentation is very important. After using this product for a few days, my skin felt softer and smooth to the touch and within a week the appearance seemed firmer and less blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; with one application. You need to be diligent and use 2x a day but if you do you WILL see results. My skin already looks healthier and feels younger. As you use the product you can be assured all natural products are going on your skin and that this product is US made.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations</li>
    <li> Lumi*Essence is an essential product for anyone who has sun spots and/or age spots.  Living in NM I am at 5,000 ft above sea level and have developed sun spots (and now that I am older, age spots as well) in the last few years.  Before I understood how damaging the sun can be here I was careless and did not regularly use sunscreen.  When sun spots started appearing on my cheeks I became more serious about shielding myself from the sun.  My doctor told me the damage was already done and the products she suggested to reduce the sunspots were so expensive that I resorted to trying cheap drug store brands that did little to brighten or lighten them.  Sweetsation&#x27;s Lumi*Essence works and is a product I can afford. I always thought that having freckles was cute, but when the sun spots and age spots began to appear they simply made my face and hands look blotchy and old.  I am so thankful for this product and this company.</li>
    <li> Using twice a day for both my husband and wife.  It seems to be working, have been using for 20 days, hope to see some benefit.  It is very nice product from France.  The writing on the face container that we bought is in french.  It came with a nice small compact extra screw on capped carrier.  It has a slight sensation of tingling, very gentle to the face.  Took some pictures before of my face and will see if it works but the natural ingredients are proven to work and good for your skin.  Great product, easy to apple this the bottle for the face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about four months. This product has helped fade (not climate) the spots on my face (cheek area and around the eyes). It is gentle on the skin as opposed to other products I have tried. The effectiveness could be improved as it has not completely eliminated the spots. Regardless, I will keep using it in hopes to obtain the desired results.</li>
    <li> I have dark spots not sure if age or sun or both.  I have wsited for over a month using this product twice per day. Yes it works!! It&#x27;s slow as the company says but it works I can  go without foundation now that much has cleared ip. If ur looking for quick result this is not ur product u have to give it time an the best part is thst it rvens out sn brighten ur face. I love am about to order my next  bottle.</li>
    <li> Good service, not a fan of t he moisturizer.  A little strong smelling for my taste.</li>
    <li> Approximately a year ago, I was talking to the esthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s office about my concerns regarding the harmful ingredients in skin care products - particularly products to reduce the appearance of brown spots and even out skin tone.  She recommended  that I try Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening.  After reading countless reviews as well as checking the product on EWG.org, I decided to give it a try.  I love this product!  My brown spots have lightened and the tone and texture of my skin has improved considerably and continues to do so.  I had finally found a product that works and is safe!  I was so pleased that I discarded everything I had been using and now only use Sweetsation products.  Thank you, Sweetsation!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive dark complexioned combination skin with hyperigmentation, after using this product I no longer have the same skin issues and my skin just glows, its great! Its gentle, natural, and effective which I love!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product - actually I am very pleased will all the products in their line.  They are well worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this for my wedding for skin brightness and also an even skin through out. This was recommend to my by a friend and I started loving this product. It definitely brings a brightness to the skin after a week or two and has a very nice smell to it. The absorption is also really great and does not have to sticky/greasy feel of other creams/moisturizers. I used this with a sunscreen as advised and it had great results. Totally recommend this for lighter and brighter skin and fixing any dark spots. Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
    <li> So I have been acne-free except when my period comes..I get 1 or 2 pimples then. But this cream may have helped me get 2 large pimples. Yuck.</li>
    <li> ever since i started using this product all my friends and coworkers are asking me what have i been using? this is the best cream ever, it really brightens my skin, got rid of the dull looking tan, and deactivated over production of melanin pigment, best part is the ingredients are so natural pure organic and safe for the skin, i had no reaction or breakouts, it smells like roses so good!!! i already bought a second backup of this and plan on using this product forever! i love the toner and cleanser as well, the sample of eye cream was amazing also. loving this line, get it you will not regret!</li>
    <li> The Sunshine State is notorious for a lot of things. Beautiful beaches. Warm weather. Crazy news stories. Spring break. Most importantly, we are known for...well... sunshine. The sun can be a great thing but more often than not, it can be brutal. I mean scorching hot and humidity you could not even believe (unless you live here of course). Since the Sunshine State means scorching hot summers, springs, autumns, and even most of the winter it is no wonder why most Floridians get dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may only be twenty-one years old but the sun has started to take its toll on my skin. I used to be very pale, so pale that I got made fun of because I couldn&#x27;t tan no matter how hard I tried. It must have been my Irish roots because my attempts at tanning resulted in me burning and turning as red as a lobster. This, in turn, caused me to have dark spots and sun damage starting in my teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweetsation Therapy Lumi&#x27;Essence Treatment has been helping me restore my porcelain skin one application at a time. I have fallen head-over-heels in love with this product. It feels like any typical moisturizer but it is so fine that it absorbs quickly into the skin rather than just sitting on the surface of the skin. It is very important that after using this product you use a sunscreen on top (at least 30 SPF) to help further protect your skin. It&#x27;s probably a good idea to wear sunscreen regardless just so you can prevent sun damage from happening in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment has a powerful composition of ingredients that helps even skin tone and gets rid of dark spots. It contains Kojic Acid which lightens and reduces the appearance of dark spots. It also contains Alpha-Arbutin, a skin lightening agent, and prevents the conversion of pigment-forming enzymes. The list of helpful ingredients goes on and on but the results speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my dark spots are starting to lighten up and becoming less defined. My skin tone is more even all over so I can feel confident in my own skin again. I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.e even all over so I can feel confident in my own skin again. I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does help my combination skin, but the texture is a bit too thick for my taste.  I like products that blend and absorb a bit easier.</li>
    <li> Hi all&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely make another purchase cause it really works and makes u feel great for sure and thanks sweetsation for making a amazing product .&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Not a greasy moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Helps your face feel soft n smooth&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs easily&lt;br /&gt;Only dime size needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s little expensive&lt;br /&gt;This is my very first review overall ..... I dint really wanted to elaborate it .... thanks</li>
    <li> I came across this product with a lot of hesitation and careful research. My skin is very sensitive and tends to break out very easily. I bought this product and have come across to my 4th bottle now. I usually do not repeat products, but this product is just phenomenal. It has worked wonders on my skin. I will be repurchasing this product over and over again!</li>
    <li> It’s worth to try this product....try it first, if you like it, then come back for the second time like me, and will be continuing in the future.  I&#x27;ve been using the Advance skin brightening/whitening to repair my aging dried skin &amp; hyperpigmentation on my lower cheeks for about 6 weeks now, and I can tell my dried skin is improved a lot, and for hyperpigmentation treatment, I know I should be patient, I don&#x27;t expect to get the result within 6 weeks.  Thanhks Argania</li>
    <li> When I was young &amp; not so smart, I spent a lot of time in the sun. Back then we didn&#x27;t worry about wearing sunscreen to protect our skin, so I&#x27;ve got lots of freckles as a result. Most of them are on my legs &amp; they don&#x27;t really bother me but I was happy to receive this Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening Repair Treatment to test &amp; review because I was curious to see if it would lighten them.&lt;br /&gt;This skin brightening treatment is from Sweetsation Therapy &amp; comes in a 2 ounce pump container. The label states that this product contains Kojic Acid to help lighten &amp; reduce the appearance of dark spots plus Alpha-Arbutin which is a skin lightening agent derived from the leaves of cranberry, blueberry &amp; bearberry shrubs to prevent the conversion of pigment-forming enzymes, along with papaya &amp; pineapple extracts which provide intense exfoliation to help reduce the size &amp; color intensity of dark spots &amp; even skin tone over time. My freckles are dark spots which cause my skin tone to be uneven so I&#x27;m hoping that this stuff will work!&lt;br /&gt;This product is a white cream with a light texture. It feels smooth &amp; cooling on my skin when I apply it &amp; absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling. The scent is light &amp; refreshing. I&#x27;ve been using this on my legs twice each day for almost a month now. That is not enough time for any product to work on a cellular level but my legs definitely feel softer &amp; hydrated. I&#x27;m going to keep using this product because I hope to see good results over time.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this on my face because I don’t have a problem with dark spots anywhere except on my legs.</li>
    <li> It was for our daughter...she loves this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lumi*Essence brightening treatment for my melasma for some time now. It naturally fades my hyperpigmentation. I use it as my moisturizer too. Great product! As long as you make it, I will be buying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Lumi essence cream for several months.&lt;br /&gt;I read that alpha-arbutin and kojic acid are natural skin brightening agents, so I wanted to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective and absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product..I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This all-natural product aims to tackle the difficult problem of stubborn, sun-related skin discolouration.  I first noticed the stains on my face after a particularly sunny summer, but I think the damage had been gradual and cumulative.  It looked like someone had splashed coffee over my cheeks and forehead and, once my tan started to fade, the stains were very evident and very ugly.  Several products I used in the past year had brought about some improvement, and of course, the winter low light conditions meant that the melanin overload eased a little, but the core stains remained.  However, I was not willing to bleach my face with just any unknown product.  I had already tested some of the Sweetsation Therapy range and liked the results and the brand&#x27;s philosophy of using only natural, non-toxic ingredients.  So I accepted a sample of this treatment …  with very low expectations, I might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dense, white lotion comes in a pump-operated canister containing 60 ml, a fair amount considering how little is needed each time.  The aroma is like fresh fruit and botanical extracts, not your usual face cream artificial perfume.  I like it and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I have been using this cream for 3 weeks now.  I apply it all over my face twice a day, after cleansing.  In the morning, I follow with Sweetsation&#x27;s Sun Si&#x27;belle Sun Screen, which is rated SPF 30 and tinted (as with all skin lightening products, it is imperative to protect your skin with a good sun screen during the treatment); in the evening, I layer it with a night moisturizing cream.  Casting an eye on the very long list of ingredients, it is clear that this preparation has nutritive properties (all those essential oils, aloe, sunflower oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, etc.) but at my age I need to top it with another moisturizer.  So, it&#x27;s okay to layer, just use whatever skin care you normally use for the day on top of the Lumi*Essence and sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual with this type of skin care, results take time and perseverance, but I am already very pleased with the change.  My stains are fading and now I have to remember where specifically the worst bits were, so I can give those areas an extra deep massage.  I was assured that this is not a bleaching formula and is, therefore, suitable for anyone with sun damage.  So, if you have this kind of discolouration, dark splotches and uneven skin tone, you might want to try this gentle but effective product before giving up.  I hope it works as well for you as it is for me.  I will update this review, should anything change down the road, but for now, this repair treatment is a winner, and something I am happy to recommend for even the most sensitive skins (like mine).care, results take time and perseverance, but I am already very pleased with the change.

    <li> Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening Repair Treatment has a unique blend of ingredients that help lighten discolorations or age spots on skin. This has a nice light texture and feel and goes on very smoothly. The product is a lotion type repair treatment that actually works as you use it. Over time you really see results. The lightening of the dark areas becomes apparent fairly quick. It is quite a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of darker patches of facial skin, they are very small. But despite how small they are, it has always sort of bothered me. So I was really thrilled to get to try this product. It has made the areas less noticeable and more light in color. Not only that the product seems to help my skin in general. It is more soft, supple, and pretty. I definitely like this skin brightening repair treatment very much. It does work. It does leave my skin brighter and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I think Kojic Acid is the key ingredient in this product.</li>
    <li> My MOM noticed a difference in my skin within 1 month, so i KNOW this product must be working!! I use this with the C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner. I will continue to purchase this item until... forever!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now! My skin has never been smoother and clearer! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin and it is because of this product! The cream isn&#x27;t sticky or thick but creamy and smooth with a very light scent. I use this product along with a mist rose water spray as a toner and it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this! I do hope this product is around forever because I plan on using nothing else but this!</li>
    <li> I have looked for a long time for clean, reasonably priced products that actually do their job (I have tried a lot of organic products).  I stumbled across this company on amazon and the they seemed reasonable so I gave it a try.  I am so happy that I did.  I have been using their products regularly and my skin has taken a major turn.  I have suffered from a rare disease from military service over seas.  I have never in my life had acne or skin problems but after dealing with these medical conditions I had cystic acne, with dry, oily skin and it looked terrible.  These products have completely turned things around.  I have pale skin and I do not have a single blemish.  My skin is even, glowing and I now get compliments all the time.  I am super grateful that there are companies like this out there that not only have amazing product but amazing customer service.  I gave up on that concept for a while.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner,  when I put it on my face I feel a little tingling and also cleans skin. I notice that it helps with my wrinkles and spots.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. felt oily and thick. also smelled bad, something like a hotel room that people have smoked in. I really wanted it to work. i used it daily and wore Sun block daily, but it didn&#x27;t reduce my acne scars or freckles.. I don&#x27;t know how it has such high ratings.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders. I have dry skin and discoloration due to acne scarring. But those problems soon went away and I saw results even the morning after I used it! It smells great and my face feels so smooth when I wake up-such a good feeling.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! My skin looked brighter and age spots started to look lighter after only a few uses. I first tried the product line a few months ago because of the natural/organic ingredients, and now I won&#x27;t ever use anything else. I use several of the products and love every one of them. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very weak formula. Hardly noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> Update: It has been three and a half months. My skin is about one shade brighter, pigmentation from contraceptive use has decreased and my skin looks and feels smooth and fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for less than a month. I bought the facial lotion first to test it out and immediately loved the natural scent. Read the ingredient list. You&#x27;ll find that you understand almost 100% of what is listed, and \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; is not one of them. If you are sensitive to natural ingredients (if you have any allergies to anything at all), you may experience breakouts or allergic reactions. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, but I tested on a small area first and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the bottle was defective to begin with (would not pump anything else out after the first dollop). However, Argania&#x27;s customer service was the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. Fast, responsive, courteous, and sent me a replacement right away with a label to send back the bad container. The pump mechanism helps you utilize ever drop of lotion. I bought the body lotion afterward. The consistency is different from the facial lotion, though the ingredients are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for skin brightening: This is not for skin bleaching. I would highly recommend only people with normal to light skin tones (naturally) to use this product for a skin brightening effect. The research I have done indicates that kojic acid works slowly and the benefits are best gained on people who were not darker to begin with. I have not used this long enough to see a difference, but will update this review. I already have a pretty light complexion, for example, I don&#x27;t tan very well I just burn. I am looking for something to smooth out my tone and make it brighter.</li>
    <li> I applied the lotion morning and night on my knees and elbows. After 1-2 weeks there was a noticeable difference on both elbows and knees. I&#x27;m still using the product (on week two) so far so good! I recommend it to anyone that refuses to use harsh chemicals on their body but still want those elbows and knees bright and smooth.</li>
    <li> Be careful.  I did some research and I think the packaging is fake. Not sure what the real ingredients are; there are news reports, organizations,  and medical websites warning about these types of problems...hopefully this helps. Try Neutrogena&#x27;s new products over the counter at your regular pharmacy store. Better safe than sorry!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past year. 61 with freckles and redness this has been just great and consistent. The smell is sweet and mellow so you can use often through out day or night. Love this and have brought more and shared with friends nd family.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say more than everyone else:&lt;br /&gt;- smells great&lt;br /&gt;- does not make me break out&lt;br /&gt;- light but moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would beg for a better price, I can&#x27;t purchase this every month at this price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and have yet to see any improvement in my skin. I have some hyper-pigmentation and a few acne scars but this whitening cream has neither faded those spots nor brightened my complexion :( What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of this company for a while now. Great products and being Organic is a cherry on the cake. I already use a few of their products and love most of them. This brightener is another of my favorites. Goes on easy and soaks in fast. I already got countless compliments that I look younger than my age. Way to go.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural!  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and the bottle lasts quite awhile.  I have some skin pigmentation issues from sun exposure and this really didn&#x27;t make a huge difference in that area, but it did make my skin soft without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brightener.  Very impressed with performance so far. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I purchased the day moisturizer too and they both are wonderful.  The whitening lotion I don&#x27;t use everyday but just enough to brighten my skin and help fade my freckles.</li>
    <li> I received Sweetsation Therapy Lumi&#x27;Essence from my husband. I am very hesitate to try out any product on my skin as I protect my skin very well. However, when the product arrived it was packaged very nicely and it looked liked a quality product. I opened it and tried a little on my hands at first. It had an amazing smell. It was a nice fresh clean and slightly flowery scent, however once you put it on your skin it wasn&#x27;t overpowering it left just a hint behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands immediately felt more nourished and softer, so I felt it deserved a chance on my face. Being the fall season my face starts to dry out a little. My face soaked it all up. It didn&#x27;t leave any residue or oily feeling that I usually have with other products. My skin feels softer and healthier. I also used it on my husband who has either really dry skin or oily skin and this product worked nicely on him also. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it has helped with dark spots but I will continue to use it if for nothing else just to make my skin feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud the people at Argania LLC for making a skin care product that actually feels good on your skin and you want to put on.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars.  I really like this product and it does work as advertised.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that it is a little oily for my taste.  However, because it works I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this about 1 week ago, and have been using it every day am and pm. I think I need more time to see it&#x27;s brightening effect. However, the texture of the cream is good, when I apply it on my face, it gave me kind of oily feeling, but iam surprised, it was absobed vey well and quick, I can feel my feel sofner right away.I will keep giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brightening lotion. Very light and smells pleasant. And it works wonders. I have very light skin, but over the years of sun worshipping, it became uneven and dull. I am on my second bottle now and definitely see a significant improvement in clarity of my skin. Being a natural product is a big benefit as well. I use it together with their eye cream that I also like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product and thought it would now be appropriate to provide a helpful review of this product. Firstly, this brightening lotion is all natural and contains no harsh chemicals, which is a priority for me when choosing a skin care product. This company has compiled the most effective skin brightening ingredients into this lotion. I live in Florida and I use it all year long to keep my skin clear from hyper pigmentation and for overall radiance. It is light enough to prevent obstruction of pores, yet penetrates and gives the skin a glow, which looks like I just had a facial. To achieve a nice, bright complexion, it is best to use this product as part of ones overall skin care regime to see beautiful results and to maintain it. That is why it has become a part of my everyday staple, and I can feel confident about using it everyday because the ingredients are far superior and safer than most &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; products on the market, and believe me, I have used just about every one of them.</li>
    <li> Love these Sweetsation products! They leave my skin feeling moist and dewy but not greasy. I have sensitive skin and&lt;br /&gt;Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day creme with Cucumber does not cause blemishes. I also use&lt;br /&gt;Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening. I started with the brightening product and they sent me a sample of the day creme which I then ordered and have been using ever since. The products last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - I use it every day. I feel it brightens and plumps my complexion. It is very moisturizing and I use it on top of a glycolic acid serum. My skin, at 45, is better than ever. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love Sweetsation Therapy Products but difinitley love this product smells yummy n more than anything I love how my skin feels</li>
    <li> I was looking basically for an organic cream to protect/moisturize my face on a daily basis. After my fair share of research I tumbled upon Lumi Essence and the product didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all. In fact I should say I came across a great natural face cream that I have been using for the past several months. I am not someone who follows up a lot with the progress of something that I use on my face, but unexpected comments from my friends about the glow and shine that they noticed on my face stands as a big testimony. Highly recommended for anyone who wants good, natural face protection.</li>
    <li> I really love this brightening treatment, it uses all the ingredients that you would expect in a brightening treatment . Its loaded with Kojic Acid,Alpha-Arbutin and Vitamin C as well as other good for the skin ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a treatment to help you get rid of age spots and age related discolorations of the skin like hyper-pigmentation than this is a great product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweetsation Therapy really uses only the very best ingredients that are targeted for your needs you get everything you could want and nothing you don&#x27;t want. it has been my experience that using these fine ingredients will help the skin to look much brighter than just using a moisturizer alone</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for the money even though they have increased the price.  I recommend this website and Diva Stuff.  They both make a great product but Diva Stuff is a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> What I did:- Used it for 2 months religiously&lt;br /&gt;What it did to me:-&amp;#34;NOTHINGGGG&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;OMG what a piece of crap. I was impressed by 100 something reviews. Spent 40$ on this face cream, but just realized that this cream and the reviews are just a bogus. I bet some of these reviews are actually by Lumi-essence company itself and not actual customers. Lumi-essence? More like Lumi-nuisance...I wish I could get my money back..</li>
    <li> I like this product, since it does not have harmful ingredients, and highly rated by EGW. It moisturize very well and seems to make my brawn spots and acne scar lighter. It will be the most effective product comparing with the other natural counterparts.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is fairly moisturizing but not greasy, and it seems to keep the hyperpigmentation in check.  However, the pumps for several of them have broken completely apart, requiring relocation to a new container.</li>
    <li> I don’t know about you, but I’m constantly looking for that skin care product I can afford that delivers what it promises; clear my skin, hydrate it, make it softer… Most of the times, with these products, I felt like I was applying something unknown aiming to see or feel a change. And most of the times, to justify its use, I had to convince myself that “maybe” my skin was improving on a microscopic level I could not see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this product and, after looking for the benefits its ingredients provide, I decided to give it a try. Now that I’ve used it for a couple of weeks, I’m glad I did; this product feels great, smells amazing, and with no adverse reactions on my skin! I can honestly say that, this is the first time I’m pleased with a skin care product I’ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Sweetsation has a phenomenal skin care line. I have sensitive skin, I tend to break out once a month due to hormones and I was looking for a product that was natural. I found it with sweetsation. This particular lotion is great, it’s mild, it dosnt leave my skin feeling greasy and my face looks brighter and healthier. I absolutely love it. My skin is never irritated and I don’t break out from this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Love the natural scent and Texture.  Looking forward to trying more products from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I saw a difference in my complexion the first day I used it. It has lightened up my existing brown spots. I am hoping with longer term and consistent use that they will get even lighter. Overall, I like how it evens out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it moisturizes and brightens the skin BUT, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very effective at removing hyperpigmentation. One question though, it&#x27;s offered in a 2oz bottle for the face and 4oz bottle for the body but are they the same formula?  Because it would seem ridiculous for anyone to order the 2oz bottles at $33.00 if the 4oz bottles are a much better deal at $44.00. Can someone please answer this for me?</li>
    <li> This one lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.  It has a very light pleasant scent and over time I did notice the dark patch on my chest fading but not the ones on my face which were darker.  I have pregnancy malasma.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. I started using the Sweetsation products over 1 year ago and I am addicted to all of them. This one is a great brightening treatment. I often use it as a night cream or a day cream. The smell is so fresh. And since I started using it I can see my dark spots slowly fading away. I never break out which used to be an issue for me. A+++++</li>
    <li> I have using this products since I received. Haven&#x27;t seen any significant change.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to these products from Sweetsation because they really work or work better than other brands I have tried for the same purpose. I have had lots of sun damage (freckles, sun spots) prematurely and with use of this product, they have been fading and are almost gone. I also feel a sense a peace using these products because they are organic/natural. Awesome products!</li>
    <li> I really really do like this as a moisturizer. It feels good and smells nice without being too overpowering. There is a light scent of roses, but also chocolate? That&#x27;s what it smells like to me anyway :)    As a brightener, it&#x27;s wonderful. I love all the natural ingredients and could definitely see a difference once I started using it. My friends commented on it for sure. As a dark spot corrector, it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. At least not in a way that I could see. But my hyperpigmentation spots seem to be extra stubborn. I&#x27;ve tried IPL, this cream, custom formulas from the dermatologist, microdermabrasions, chemical peels, hydroquinone... My spots have gradually lightened a bit, but nothing dramatic. So I can&#x27;t really fault the Lumi*Essence when nothing has really worked that well on me.</li>
    <li> I started using the Lumi Essence Brightening Treatment after I delivered my baby.  I got many black spots during my pregnancy.  After using it for several months, the black spots got less visible.  Now I am buying a full line which also includes cleanser, toner, day cream and night cream.  I feel comfortable using Sweetsation products while still breastfeeding my baby and they do work.  They only complaint is the shipping fee.</li>
    <li> I have received a sample of LumiEssence with another purchase from this company; first I must say that I love when companies send out free samples; this is the only way to try something before committing to purchasing a full size product and I know being provided any amount of a beauty cream is not cheap, especially the really good ones; so I am so happy that I received this sample because I am hooked now; it&#x27;s truly an amazing product; after using it for just over a week my friends wondered if I had something done…. a very good sign; I am not sure if I see anything myself aside of the obvious, which is much smoother &amp; softer skin, but my friends saw a noticeable difference (I couldn&#x27;t stop receiving compliments actually); maybe because I see myself in the mirror all the time I didn&#x27;t notice these subtle changes; I could go on as it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream so far!!!!!! I like the smell of Lumi*Essence. This is a light weight cream,i use it as a daily moisturizer too. This cream is like All in one cream for me</li>
    <li> I like this cream, very few creams suit my sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs and smells great. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Skin looks brighter but the dark spots haven&#x27;t faded. I only use it once a day.</li>
    <li> Not too vain, but when the freckles started to join up and form gangs, I looked around for something to lighten them up. Based on reviews, I tried Lumi*Essence.  As long as you use it consistently it works well. Got lazy in the winter and the spots made a comeback. I also make sure to use sunscreen with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and light during application and does not feel or look greasy. I have had no trouble with skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this two years later and still liking it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really love all the Sweetsation products I have used.  I think they actually do a very good job and my pores look very nice!</li>
    <li> I hope this is working because I love the feel of it and the delicious scent.  Strong perfumes make me ill, but this is really a nice balance and my skin feels/looks good.</li>
    <li> I have finished using 3-4 bottles and I am very pleased with the results. It not only brighten the skin and made the brown marks lighter but it also prevented break outs. I always had a few breakouts every month which would then leave brown spots but it does not happen anymore. I love the fragrance, it is very refreshing and sweet. I am going to continue using this and would also like to try their other products.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing and feels great going on the skin, The smell is like a light soft scent of  coco butter with a touch of cucumber. Every time I put it on I feel pampered.  I have to be honest I haven&#x27;t used it consistently everyday since I have bought it. I test a lot of  skin products. I can say when I did use it my skin was hydrated, not greasy, did not breakout and  I can tell a faint lightening of sun spots. As with any natural product , PATIENCE and consistent use will deliver the best results.  I fully intend on buying this product again and the body lotion. I will report back with the results of continued use.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders on freckles. I am very light skinned blond with hystory of red haired people in my family. A couple of years ago I started noticing some freckles coming out and after spending some tiume outside they looked darker. I decided to find some natural treatment in hopes to nip the problem at the bud. I have tried AHA treatment for the same purpose, which helped a little, but was making my skin itchy. This lotion was my second. And I am happy to say that I like it better, even more expensive. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. And delivered what described. Just after one month, my freckles are gone about 50%. Worth continuing. I also received a sample of body cream. Maybe will buy it too for my shoulders and chest.</li>
    <li> Simply the best facial cream for my skin!!!.My face now enjoys even tone and it&#x27;s none drying.. I love this product.. I&#x27;m definitely a Happy Customer!!!!</li>
    <li> This is thus far my favourite product, it made my pores less visible, although this wasnt the original reason why i purchased it, but the pore minimizer is a bonus of course...brightens and evens out marks and moisturizes the same time...oh and smells like fruits.This is sooo worth it</li>
    <li> After an exhaustive search for products that worked with an organic base, this product truly is remarkable. My skin feels smoother and has a glow to it. I put this on before my foundation. I have received a few compliments on my skin as well. I would recommend the night cream as well in this line, apply it after you wash your face, and your skin will look fresh in the morning.</li>
    <li> A bruise on my face from dental surgery left a dark scar a month after healing. I have been using the cream intermittently for 1.5 months and have noticed considerable improvement. With daily use, I am sure I would see better results. I also love the fact that it almost all natural and a much better alternative than the toxic Hydroquinone that is in most skin brightening creams.</li>
    <li> This product really works, the texture of my skin is smoother and my skin just glows and I only use it at night. I have oily and acne prone skin, and I have had no breakout with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not really help with hyperpigmentation, you will need glycolic acid for that (you can try Avon Anew Rejuvenate Glycolic Facial Treatment), you put it on only the darkened areas after leaving this product soak into skin for 10 - 20mins.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite of all the Sweet Sation products - it makes my skin feel wonderful. I love that these products are organic, and the ingredients are natural, no chemicals, and just good for your skin.  I use the complete skin line since trying them a few months ago, and now I am just waiting for the sunscreen to complete my skin care!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m originally from SE Asia &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t fair very well in SoCal&#x27;s dry weather. It gets itchy and irritated, especially during the winter months, and I end up getting blemishes all over my face and body. I could feel it going to work almost immediately. After a week the blemishes faded into oblivion. My search for an all natural and effective skin treatment is over. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It brightened the overall skin tone, and my skin began to have a healthy glow! I used the facial cream right after using sweetsation toner and before applying day or night cream. It has not only brightened my skin, it&#x27;s also kept my skin hydrated. The texture of the cream is very soft and it gets absorbed immediately. I am definitely planning on continuing to use the product along with the &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; line from Sweetsation in the future!</li>
    <li> I am 38 and I have been a Clinique loyal since 2008. Clinique has kept my skin youth looking, but lately I noticed that I have uneven skin tone. I searched online products that can brighten my skin. I read about kojic acid. I read reviews of products with kojic acid. Sweetsation whitening repair treatment got good reviews so I tried it. This will be my second order. After using for a month, I see the changes. My skin brightens. I know it really works for me. I also like the free scrub and moisturizer. This time, I ordered the repair treatment and the toner.</li>
    <li> I definitely think this works better than hydroquinone formulas. I have a bad sun spot right on the bridge of my nose from high school when I got a LOT of sun without any sunblock. After going through about half the bottle, I distinctly notice that the sun spot is lighter and my face overall looks more even. The downside to this product is that it smells pretty bad and is quite pricey. I can&#x27;t really explain what the smell is other than a nondescript chemical-ly smell, which to me, is pretty off putting. I think this is worth a try, though, if other dark spot correctors haven&#x27;t been working for you.</li>
    <li> Like the other product I got from this company, this product does not do anything. You can smell some of the ingredients, as it smells like fruit but nothing noticeable after using this nightly. I say save your money and keep searching.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2 months ago, and my skin has never looked better!! I was an avid Proactiv user for 8 years and swore by it. However, I noticed that in my early thirties, my skin began getting very dry, and no amount of moisturizer would help. This product is amazing! I love that it contains all organic ingredients and, it has helped to fade my melasma spots. I plan to use it for many years to come :)</li>
    <li> This actually works and helps with improving pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I used to have really bad acne scars from my acne problems.  I&#x27;ve been using Sweetsation&#x27;s product about two months now and I can definitely see a difference in the clarity of my skin.  My acne scars have definitely become lighter and less visible.  I&#x27;m sure that over a few more months, they will be completely gone!  Remember, you have to be consistent and patient to see great results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;ve used this product every single day after I shower.  It is supposed to lighten skin, however I do not see much difference at all.  I&#x27;m looking for a new and better product to substitute this one.  I have dark spots on my face, and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to visibly lighten them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets an extra star because it smells good when applied.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The 1rst time I use it, I could feel a difference in my skin. This will be my new skin care. Thank you Lumi Essence.</li>
    <li> This treatment has such a nice soothing fragrance, comforts me during my sleep time and at the time, working on my face to make me beautiful :-) would strongly recommend, though little pricey - still worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3 rd order , I use it every evening, it made my skin look younger and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is immediately.I&#x60;am very satisfied with this products&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend you follow the instructions for the most effective treatment.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid forties and had been using this for about a year and decided to try other organic brands. My skin was showing the loss. Shame on me. This cream does wonders for texture and moisture. My face  once again has a glow. Thank you sweets action ,your products are soo wonderful.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I gotta say that this thing worked great for me. It didn&#x27;t erase all the sunspots on my face but it made my skin look fresh and healthy. The only thing I kinda don&#x27;t like about it is that it has a little bit of smell when I put it on that&#x27;s kinda flowery to me but you don&#x27;t smell in when it&#x27;s on your face already. But so far so great. I want to buy the one for body too but it&#x27;s a bit heavy on my budget.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before.  that tells you a lot.  It works well.  Seems to be safe.  I just have to adapt to the price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! At 34, I am plagued with hormonal acne. The past several months it has been awful, and I have been left with a lot of scars and discoloration. I tried this product in hopes that it would fade the scarring and discoloration all over my face. Truthfully, I wasn&#x27;t expecting good results, as that has been my fate with many other products I have tried in the past. I am so happy and excited to say that this product is working for me. I have been using it 2x daily for just over a week (a little goes a long way) and cannot believe the results thus far. My scars and discoloration marks are actually fading. They are not completely gone, but they are greatly improved, and that&#x27;s in just over a week. My skin is also so much more bright and has almost a glow about it, that even my husband has noticed. That is saying a lot!  I really hope this cream continues to deliver. Fingers crossed, so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> Found this product for lightening the acne spot on my face, used it for 2 weeks, not sure if it will work, but definitely enjoy the texture and smell of this product.</li>
    <li> This cream lightened my sun spots as well, if not better than, some other more expensive department store products that I&#x27;ve tried. It didn&#x27;t work as well on some of the tougher spots on my hands, but it did lighten them a bit. But if you wash your hands several times a day as I do, you can&#x27;t expect sunscreen to stay on. And if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen you might as well forget about it.</li>
    <li> As a woman in her mid-30s who likes to spend a lot of time in the sun, I find it necessary to invest in quality skincare products. Lumi*Essence Brightening Repair cream is the product that I always return to because I know that my skin will thank me! I travel frequently and I always like to try out products from other countries, just in case there is something that I am missing. I have been known to shell out an embarrassing amount of cash for a promising brightening cream, especially if it is organic. The quality that I get with Lumi*Essence is well worth the price and a little goes a long way. Plus, I always get compliments on my skin when I have been using this product regularly.</li>
    <li> I must compliment the person who came up with the formula for the Lumi&#x27; Essence Repair Treatment cream.  I was so pleased with the  results&lt;br /&gt;from the first jar, I ordered it again.  My skin had been looking drab and dull, and after I applied it, my skin looked much younger and brighter.  Beats the expensive creams, I have tried over the years.</li>
    <li> This product has been working great for me in making my skin looking brighter and healthier. I don&#x27;t have much issues with bad dark spots needing to be lightened at all. So I can&#x27;t compare it to others or say for certain its going to keep out the more extreme skin tones. However, for my skin tone I feel like my skin looks so much more even toned for sure. The Sweetsations product line always smells so nice. I love the smell of this product. I also feel like my skin is really moisturized after using the product and it does not dry my skin out at all. Over all this product is working for my skin tone. It has not caused any skin reactions at all. As a blogger I did receive this product complementary in exchange for inspection and my honest opinions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with melasma for years and had really prominent dark patches on my face. After one full bottle the worst of my marks are gone completely, I&#x27;m now in my second bottle because I got too ambitious and forgot to use face blovk which resulted in created more patches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this be aware that it will cause a but of irritation to the skin such as spots etc but stick with it, the change in skin takes some time and because you use it daily you don&#x27;t seem to notice he change until you&#x27;ve reached the end of the bottle. Whatever you do, do not forget to use sun block or you&#x27;ll be undoing all of the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fabulous product that I can&#x27;t do without.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd re-order of this product.  It is absolutely wonderful on my face and has diminished the dark circles under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t like using anything else on my face.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. I have sensitive skin, and will often have a reaction to creams and lotions. This face cream is light, and smells wonderful. If I&#x27;m feeling tired or my skin is reacting to other things, this lotion is the perfect thing to soothe my skin and seems to wake it up a bit. I&#x27;m not consistent enough with it to know if it actually brightens long term, but I get compliments on my skin when I&#x27;ve been using it regularly; goes great under my make-up too!</li>
    <li> I brought the brighten face cream &amp; honestly, it actually works &amp; noticed within a week &amp; I also used this on small parts of my body where there are dark marks and it made a difference. It slowly even out my skin tone and it&#x27;s not like a skin beach.  It made my face glow &amp; corrected my dark marks over my body.  The smell is ok but overall I love this product :)</li>
