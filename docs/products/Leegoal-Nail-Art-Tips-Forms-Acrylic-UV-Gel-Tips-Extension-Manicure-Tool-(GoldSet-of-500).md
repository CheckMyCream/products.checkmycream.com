    <li> not very helpful....i thought it may help on the sides of my nails but it is strictly for form at the tops of your nails. if you just want to extend, i am sure they are fine...</li>
    <li> THEY DON&#x27;T STICK VERY WELL AND WHEN STICKING TOGETHER THEY COME APART WHICH MAKES PUTTING ON ACRYLIC DIFFICULT IF IF YOU HOLD THEM DOWN THEY CAUSE THE ACRYLIC TO LIFT WITH IT. HAD TO ORDER DIFFERENT ONES</li>
