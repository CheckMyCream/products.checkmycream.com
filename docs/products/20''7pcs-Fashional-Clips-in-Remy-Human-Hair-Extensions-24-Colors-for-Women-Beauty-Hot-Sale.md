      <li>Love these extensions right on time</li>
      <li>These are really versatile and cute.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 sets in order to have the full amount of hair needed.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t change them just make sure you use your hair oil when washing them and they will come out looking brand new after washing them.</li>
      <li>Color is exactly as indicated.</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t hold curl as much as I would like.</li>
      <li>Very sparse strands in the bundles</li>

      <li>Very stringy hair and the clips were too big...</li>
      <li>But, I was pleasantly surprised when they came.</li>
      <li>They can by dyed at home along with your hair and with the different lengths of the clip ins (some with 1 clip, some with 4 clips), they&#x27;re really versatile.</li>
      <li>I liked them a lot but the only thing that I would consider a con is that they had a few split ends when I received them and they felt dry.</li>
      <li>altho id have to say that if you have thick hair buy 2 or more packages, one pack would work fine for think hair but for thick hair</li>
      <li>there long and very soft the clips work well and were  not slipping out of my hair.</li>

<li> Extremely, it almost had me requestioning if it was even synthetic or not.</li>

<li> it&#x27;s hard to clip to my hair and it looks weird inti</li>
<li> they were thin and stringy, and the clips were broken and detached from the weft.</li>
<li> Bought 2 packets, STILL too thin</li>
<li> but very thin so I&#x27;d recommend buying 2 sets</li>
<li> Very thin pieces.</li>
<li> I was afraid of what they might be like, considering the price,</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like it :(</li>
<li> my hair :( !</li>

    <li> Matched hair perfectly, but putting them in took practice.</li>
    <li> Love these extensions right on time</li>
    <li> These are really versatile and cute. Easy to use and look great! They can by dyed at home along with your hair and with the different lengths of the clip ins (some with 1 clip, some with 4 clips), they&#x27;re really versatile.</li>
    <li> there long and very soft the clips work well and were  not slipping out of my hair. altho id have to say that if you have thick hair buy 2 or more packages, one pack would work fine for think hair but for thick hair it just not enuff volume</li>
    <li> Well made.  The color is perfect!</li>
    <li> So I waited a week to write this to see how they were. At first very soft, thin but still good. Through out the week it would really tangle with my real hair and the clips started to fall apart from the wefts. You essentially get what you pay for. If you want good quality you have to pay more.</li>
    <li> Very sparse strands in the bundles</li>
    <li> Love this hair! Color is exactly as indicated. Quick shipping. Hair quality is good too.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thicker hair, I suggest 2 packs of hair though.</li>
    <li> It looks real but feels fake like a dry but silky texture. I tried straightening it, it didn&#x27;t melt but did get a little frizzy on the ends. Impressed for human hair? No, I don&#x27;t think these are. Impressed for synthetic hair? Extremely, it almost had me requestioning if it was even synthetic or not. These extensions aren&#x27;t the best but aren&#x27;t the worst.</li>
    <li> These extension arrived on time and I was able to place them in my hair for cheer. I needed my hair put up for cheer and these added length to my pony tails and when I left them down. they don&#x27;t hold curl as much as I would like. it ends up being more of a wave.</li>
    <li> For the price... The quality of these are amazing! They were perfect for the occasion! I ordered 2 sets in order to have the full amount of hair needed.  So buy 2 sets!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 packets, STILL too thin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it :( it&#x27;s hard to clip to my hair and it looks weird inti my hair :( !</li>
    <li> very pretty but color was different when we got it</li>
    <li> Very stringy hair and the clips were too big... not worth it your better off getting somewhere that tells you how many grams you get.</li>
    <li> Very thin pieces. Id get two packages of extensions. The color was great though!</li>
    <li> perfect match for my hair! definetly would recommend this product to friends and family. easily come in and out to put in.</li>
    <li> these extensions were horrible. they were thin and stringy, and the clips were broken and detached from the weft. worst extensions ive ever gotten. never ordering from this vendor again!!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought extensions a few different times, this was my third set.  I was afraid of what they might be like, considering the price, But, I was pleasantly surprised when they came. Everything was on time, and the extensions are soft and great quality :)  I will definitely use this seller again in the future!!!</li>
    <li> I liked them a lot but the only thing that I would consider a con is that they had a few split ends when I received them and they felt dry. I would recommend them to someone that is looking for longer hair or volume in there already long hair.</li>
    <li> I mixed them with my real hair extensions and you couldn&#x27;t even tell they were fake they look great! I use them for rodeo queening so I&#x27;d always be curling them and using heat on them it didn&#x27;t change them just make sure you use your hair oil when washing them and they will come out looking brand new after washing them. but very thin so I&#x27;d recommend buying 2 sets</li>
    <li> I have light red hair, when I was younger my hair was dark red but as i have aged it is falling out and it&#x27;s 4 shades lighter these make me feel younger and they blend right in  i love them</li>
    <li> The add should tell you this will only work for someone that have extremely thin hair. I would not recommend for someone that have very thick hair.. Will need about 4 to 5 to work. I order was very slow to get here since it comes from China. I don&#x27;t recommend the product for people with thick hair.</li>
