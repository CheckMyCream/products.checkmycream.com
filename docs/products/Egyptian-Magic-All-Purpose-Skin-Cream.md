      <li>was too good to be true.  </li>

      <li>I used to use this product on my face but have since found products better for inflammation and aging.</li>

      <li>Love this product, great for dry skin!</li>
      <li>My skin stayed hydrated and smooth for 24 hours after use.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s a million products that can do just that for a more economical price.</li>
      <li>No smell, light weight</li>
      <li>A light almost lemony scent, an ability to melt into my skin without running or getting all over the pillow at night.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sides of the bottle are different on these pictures. Nice try but its not real. Wish I could post a picture of the real EM on here. Go to there website and compare my good folks</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered the larger product but I am satisfied with the2 0z&#x27;er.  Egyptian Magic is great for use on the face or any part of the body.  After a period of time the skin looks younger and fresher.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the hype. Its really not all that. Definitely made my skin extra soft and smooth in texture... but I mean.... there&#x27;s a million products that can do just that for a more economical price. I saw a lot about evening complexion but, nah... haven&#x27;t noticed any of that yet. Worked well after getting a chemical peel tho. It masked the peeling a lot. I was also detoxing on a fully raw cleanse and got a detox rash on my chest... and this cream did not perform any more magic than some good ol&#x27; shea butter could do. I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> Vaseline is just as good! I have very dry skin and it is dry the next day after I used this.</li>
    <li> It is magic for majority skin problems!</li>
    <li> This is a counterfeit product. No use by date and no sealing whatsoever. What a waste.</li>
    <li> I love Egyptian Magic. I have terribly dry skin and I hate perfumes.  This lovely salve smells mildly of honey and is the only product that helps my dry skin. I apply liberally to my face, forearms, and other dry areas after a shower (while my hair is still wrapped in a towel).  It goes on rather greasy but soaks in after a few minutes, leaving my skin glowing.  I&#x27;ll also apply to my feet before bed sometimes, then wear socks to keep my sheets clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting the smaller 2oz size, as a little goes a long way and it will go rancid if left too long your bathroom cabinet -- after all, it is basically made of FOOD, with no preservatives!  I made the mistake of buying the larger size once and had to throw about half of it away after a couple of years (yes, years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; is really not the correct description; &amp;#34;salve&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; would be better.  It&#x27;s similar to the texture of vaseline, though of course made from lovely all-natural ingredients, not petroleum!</li>
    <li> This product does work magic for some of the things they listed on their label. It did not work for pimples but worked great on babies cradle cap.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> JUST LOVE THE VELVETY SMOOTH CREAM !&lt;br /&gt;SO EMOLLIENT AND NO SCENT  LASTS A LONG TIME</li>
    <li> Very good except for the smell. If they can fix that, I&#x27;ll make it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very light but mousturizing!! No greasy feeling... No toxins, chemicals or parabrnd! No smell, light weight</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few nights now as my moisturizer (in place of grape seed out that I had been using). I am getting used to the oils as skincare so I like the consistency. Smells like beez wax, but is a very light scent (no added perfumes). Seems like a little will go a long way. I had been reading about Bee Propolis which is supposed to work miracles for your face, especially if you break out. So far so good. I&#x27;m impressed with it and the way my skin has looked over the past few days.</li>
    <li> Mostly beeswax, best on younger skin.</li>
    <li> I heard from another reviewer on this that it was a fake. Well I checked it out and to the best of my knowledge it&#x27;s the real deal, it had all the quality&#x27;s of an authentic EM according to the official EM website. This product is not a miracle worker though, but then again I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month. It is very moisturizing and can be used for anything, I put it all over my face even over my eye lids, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate them. It&#x27;s replaced all my other night creams and eye moisturizers. If you want that miracle work you&#x27;ll have to buy serums but overall it&#x27;s pretty great :)</li>
    <li> I got it for repair scars from acne popping. The portion is pretty big, so it&#x27;ll last for a while.</li>
    <li> Yes I really really do! My skin is looking flawlessly good, since being bite a brown spider in m y backyard Aug 2012</li>
    <li> I have been using this product after recommendation from my niece who has a really beautiful skin. I use it as moisturizer in the morning and at night. I have also used it for neck cream. A little cream goes a long way. A bit greasy on my face but I love how the cream keeps my skin hydrated. I have also used it on my surgery scars from mastectomy and reconstruction. It really helps with the healing process. I love the fact that there are only 6 ingredients and I can pronounce all of them and know exactly what they are!</li>
    <li> Too greasy for me, and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> This creme was wonderful, there&#x27;s just not enough of it for the price. However, I will buy it again; my whole family loved it. It goes on smoothly and feels great -not sticky. There&#x27;s really no smell to it, just straight product.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great!! Keeps your skin very soft!! I learned of the product from a magazine interview with Chaka kan. She has used it for years.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what the fuzz is all about. If I had known that it is no better than petroleum jelly I surely would not have spent the money</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! If you are out on the town and need an all-in-one moisturizer, this is it! Just throw it in your purse and GO!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for chapped lips or taking off eye makeup. But you don&#x27;t want it all over your face at all! Was totally surprised upon receipt that it is NOT a cream AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Great all-purpose cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna give it three stars only cause it started breaking me out when I used it. Note I&#x27;m very dry and needed something to give me moisture back into my flaky skin. Well it didn&#x27;t work for me but my little girl had diaper rash so I decided to try it out on her and within minutes her bottom was clear of all redness and she wasn&#x27;t in diaper rash pain. Saving it for her cause her skin can handle it.</li>
    <li> My skin stayed hydrated and smooth for 24 hours after use. Love this!</li>
    <li> I am using my husband account but wanted to give a review of this amazing product.  I absolutely LOVE it and will never be without it.  I derma roll once a week and suffer the discomfort for days after.  This cream makes my face heal faster and my skin doesnt dry and flake like it used to after the rolling.  Now its baby smooth younger looking.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. I use it everyday. It really helps to keep my extremely dry skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Keep hearing about this product and wanted to try it. Love that it&#x27;s not greasy. A little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and this product keeps my skin hydrated while getting rid of the dry red patches on the corners of my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer but I will warn that it takes about an hour to soak into the skin and it&#x27;s pretty greasey till then so I would suggest that this be a nighttime regime unless you are retired like me and can put on in the am and wait an hour before applying makeup. It does seem to plump up my facial skin and looks very nourished and makes the makeup look even better and go on nicer. Feels good on the hands, chest and arms , those areas seem to soak in quicker. It has a slight olive oil type odor at first but I do not find that offensive. I have not tried on feet and legs yet but I imagine it will work as well. Nice to have all natural product on the skin.</li>
    <li> It is very useful in fall or winter, My skin usually get drier in fall but after using that I feel good</li>
    <li> I MOSTLY USE IT FOR MY CUTICLES CAUSE I AM A SKIN PICKER BUT ONCE I PUT IT ON I DONT HAVE THE URGE TO PICK NO MORE SO I USE IT QUIT A BIT BUT IVE BEEN A SKIN PICKER FOR YEARS AND THIS SEEMS TO HELP AND I GOT THE FIRST DAY OF EXPETED DELIVERY WHICH WAS AWESOME. SO YES I LIKE IT AND DO RECOMMENT IT TO OTHERS. I SAW THIS ON &amp;#34;RACHEL RAY&amp;#34; THEM I  LOOKED IT UP ON AMAZON AND IT HAD GREAT REVIEWS SO &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; I DO LIKE IT .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS A MILLION!</li>
    <li> My favorite. I was told I &amp;#34;look 12&amp;#34; because I use this stuff every night. Amazing.</li>
    <li> The product is great, however two out of the three jars I have ordered from Amazon have been very dry. When I purchase it from the health food store, it is more expensive, but very moist and creamy. Since the jar lasts such a long time, when the cream starts out old and dry, it is almost impossible to spread it once it&#x27;s a few months old.</li>
    <li> Great for my dry skin . It works great after you go to the  tanning bed you don&#x27;t stay burnt</li>
    <li> I have been using Egyptian Magic for many years and LOVE it.  It is my favorite thing to put on my skin...and I use it everywhere!  From my face to my toes.  I give it to my friends, and my 87 year old Father uses it everywhere also.  It truly is MAGIC!!!</li>
    <li> When someone first recommended this to me, I was really skeptical. I have always had oily skin and clogged pores so the idea of smearing a thick jelly across my face freaked me out. However, I am now a total convert! My face is clear, I&#x27;ve had less breakouts, and when I do have a pimple, I feel like a dab of this makes it head up faster so I can get rid of it. A lot of reviews say it&#x27;s too expensive, but I feel like this will last me a really long time because a little dab goes a long way, just warm it in your hands until it turns into an oil and massage it in to your skin. It has also helped tremendously with my cracked heels and a patch of chronically dry skin on my knee.</li>
    <li> Not that magic to me...</li>
    <li> Not digging this and still trying to figure out what the big deal is.  I keep reading the ingredients to see, &amp;#34;are you sure this is not Vaseline?&amp;#34;  This is by far the greasiest product I have ever used, and not really sure the results; except I did get new breakouts rather than reducing lines!</li>
    <li> I love this so much-lives up to the reviews!!!! Wonderful for extra dry skin problems and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!!!</li>
    <li> So good for callous feet</li>
    <li> I liked it.. It helped the dryness but it was only a temporary fix for me. after about 2 days it was dry again. I found something else that works better for me. But it may work great for someone else&#x27;s skin type, just not a keeper for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as an eye cream and when coconut oil is not doing the trick and my face still seems a little dry. One jar will last forever!</li>
    <li> Egyptian Magic can be used in place of Vaseline and is great when you would prefer to NOT use a petroleum product. I always have this in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Got small bumps all over my face.  Clogged pores, disclaimer that I was using in conjuction with Joyal Beauty Royal Jelly Serum.  But stopped using the Serum and the bumps never went away until I stopped using this completely.  Went away on a trip for 5 days, didn&#x27;t bring either product and my skin cleared up.  No way of knowing which product it was that caused the clogged pores but I did have periods of isolated usage, to no avail.</li>
    <li> I wanted something natural that I could use as a nightcream.  I should have known &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; was too good to be true.  A very little goes a long way, but I&#x27;ve found this too heavy for my whole face.  I love using it as an eye cream though!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday, morning and night.  I really love it and it lasts forever.  I put the cream on dry areas on my face and then take a lighter cream and blend it in everywhere.</li>
    <li> use it every night and feel wonderful.  will recommend to all my friends. I can feel my face getting softer every morning</li>
    <li> This cream is worth every penny. I use it on dry patches on my face and when I wake up in the morning - dry patch gone!</li>
    <li> Not as described, said 4 OZ but only got 2 OZ one. Double the amount, one can get one 4 OZ plus 2 OZ at Costco.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my sunscreen on my legs and I love the soft results. Sounds odd, but it makes my legs silk soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the All Purpose Cream.  Both r All Purpose Skin Cream, unfortunately I opened both before I realized that there was a mistake.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be good for very dry skin but it was so greasy that I had to be careful what I wore.  It also didn&#x27;t help my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a decent ointment, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34;  I would choose something else (my other go to is the Honest Company Healing Balm) for the price.</li>
    <li> i like it. very oily feeling but helps my skin to recover from acnes.</li>
    <li> Very sad.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived today&lt;br /&gt;The cap is loose&lt;br /&gt;No shrink seal.&lt;br /&gt;Came open&lt;br /&gt;Paid almost 25 bucks&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years around my eyes, just wipe off the excess. It will keep your skin moist all day. If you use it on your face for cold outdoor activity it will protect your skin the whole time from the frigid temps. I am 54 and have no wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and combination skin. I suffer from a lot of redness, but I don&#x27;t have this problem after using this product every night before bed. It&#x27;s sticky but eventually you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I use it at night as a night cream. It&#x27;s not overly greasy for my but what I love most about it is I&#x27;m the morning my skin feels soft &amp; hydrated. My skin is unusual in so dry but yet it&#x27;s acne prone so finding something that can help with acne &amp; hydrate at the same time is hard. This stuff has great healing properties.</li>
    <li> not stimulate the skin.Some greasy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for someone and they love it!!!  Said it makes the hair look natural, shinning and soft.  They just love it!</li>
    <li> I have seen Egyptian Magic on the beauty product shelves at my local Natural Foods Co-op but never thought to try it until I started reading small mentions in magazines (usually made by celebrities).  The cream is dreadfully expensive in the Co-op but I checked Amazon and found a reasonable price so decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s lovely.  A light almost lemony scent, an ability to melt into my skin without running or getting all over the pillow at night.  I use it mostly for a night cream.  Leaves skin soft and smooth.  And a little goes a long way.  Definitely a favorite now.</li>
    <li> Ignore the other reviews about how to tell a fake - most got it wrong.  Go to the EM website [...]  They explain how to tell.    To be safe, buy it from an authorized vendor.  They are on the website also.    By the way, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Feels very nourishing and healing on the skin. Oil based. A little sticky. My skin is still flaking and peeling due to the dry winter air, but this is a pretty good cream for other times of year or less dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I discovered it several years ago, and since then I&#x27;ve been using it daily. It seems greasy at first, but absorbs into skin without clogging. I use it on my face at night, and on my hands/cuticles. One pot lasts long time, so the price is extremely reasonable, considering this product works better for me than some fancy skin creams.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful balm.  highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve happily used it on my face and lips, as a cuticle softener,  on dry heels and as a grooming tool for wayward eyebrows.  get some!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a little heavy to wear under makeup or before leaving for the day but I love it add s night cream. Your skin is soft and moisturized in the morning and ready for whatever your makeup regimen is.</li>
    <li> Interesting composition of ingredients that moisturizes with out being greasy (clarification-seems greasy when you first apply but after you rub it in that goes away)  Seems to last longer than other things I&#x27;ve tried, for instance Bag Balm works great but if you put it on your heels, you better wear socks until it sinks in then it wears off.  Good for feet, elbows, knees-might try it on my neck later on ;-)</li>
    <li> This is such a versatile cream and you can use it all over!  I use it for a  bedtime facial mask and daytime lip moisturizer and hand crack healer.  It leaves too much of a shine to be used as a facial day cream, though.  It smells like bees wax, and it doesn&#x27;t look like a feminine moisturizer, so my husband is willing to use it too!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading about it in a magazine.  It is wonderful!  I use it on my face, lips, hands, feet, etc.  My skin is smooth and soft.  It can have a greasy feel but that could be user error by applying too much and not waiting for it to soak in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s said it&#x27;s magic！But it useless for me！So oil，I have no idea about it. I will countinue using it，hope it useful！</li>
    <li> Small jar~product is nothing to shout about.&lt;br /&gt;Was a little disappointed in what I thought&lt;br /&gt;would be a wonderful item.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! It really does wonders for my skin, makes it glow and leaves no dry patches.  It is unscented, so it just has that plasticy smell that many unscented products have, that would be my only complaint. I use it daily on my face, hands, feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this produce seems to really hydrate my skin and plumps up! And helps with acne a little as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is its greasy appeal for 30 or so.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if this is the real one or just a first class copy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it is good and i wear it as a base for my make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think it is protecting my skin from absorbing the foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yeh,, this picture make the cream looks big be careful guys it is only 2 oz .. emm, something like small pegmant from mac</li>
    <li> I like it~ I will recommand this to my friends. I&#x27;m going to  buy a larger size next time, haha.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product on my face but have since found products better for inflammation and aging. As an esthetician I am cynical of all products and have a wait and see on my own skin. I like this product only at night-because always during the day you need to have on spf and this is heavy enough. I like this product but it doesn&#x27;t let your skin breathe so well and I never break out-but did have occasional breakouts from it. I love it on my lips, cuticles and on my hands after putting on a serum or retin A product. Elbows, feet also.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible.  I also purchased Blessed Sweet Bee Magic because one of the reviews said it worked well as well, but the Egyptian Magic product is far superior especially at moisturizing and lessening the appearance of scars.</li>
    <li> Heavy waxy consistency that gets very oily after being warmed by the skin. Does not absorb  into the skin.</li>
    <li> Great as a night face cream this winter!  This really does a great job of soothing the dryness from this very cold winter.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do as states.  I thought this cream would work well on my patches of dry skin, it did nothing..Get the Sweet Bee Magic instead, works great!!</li>
    <li> I use this cream for my face and it is extremely moisturizing. I also feel like it has improved the texture of my skin. I have combination skin and this does leave my face looking dewy. But this doesn&#x27;t really bother me and my foundation/powder goes well over it. A little goes a long way with this product, so I don&#x27;t think its overpriced compared to regular lotions/moisturizers. It&#x27;s perfect as a night cream and you wake up with really soft/dewy/hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> I use it at night after doing the dishes &amp; my hands feel great!!&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again and again!!</li>
    <li> I use this after washing my face at night as it is a little greasy. It has really smoothed out the rough patches in my skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent! My skin has never been better!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for moisterising skin. It can be a little oily at first but it eventually absorbs into the skin. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This does for the skin that other products don&#x27;t. Great for sections of your skin that tend to be dry..heels, elbows etc...and lasts for at least 2 years with daily spot use. A great buy!</li>
    <li> I am VERY satisfied!!!:-)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have eczema and sometimes acne breakouts due to my and this stuff brings balance to my face and its all natural!!!</li>
    <li> I think that I expected too much relying on rave reviews of others. I had small hopes that it might permanently take care of dry skin in just one or two uses. It doesn&#x27;t do that - but it does help.</li>
    <li> It says cream but it is not creamy at all. It does work ok, however the smell is not my favorite either</li>
    <li> First off, I love the ingredients, I know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my face and I am all about all natural products. I have been using this for about a month now and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. A little goes a long way, so this tiny jar will last me a long time, which is great. I mix this with a few drops of pure tea tree oil (for my acne), so I think I don&#x27;t get quite the moisture results I could since the tea tree oil dries things out, but it&#x27;s a great balance. I never have dry patches anywhere on my skin, and on the other end my skin is never greasy or overly moisturized. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an effective, all natural moisturizer!</li>
    <li> A nice jelly, but I didn&#x27;t feel it worked any better than my Aquaphor for the price. I will use the jar, but probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy again.</li>
