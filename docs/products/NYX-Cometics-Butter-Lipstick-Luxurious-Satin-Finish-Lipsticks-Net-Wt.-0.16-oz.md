      <li>Love the color and ease of application.</li>
      <li>I love the color.  </li>
      <li>Love the texture but the color POP is not as the image a way darker, more to brown tone</li>
      <li>I love makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited!  </li>
      <li>Very complimentary color and silky  smooth!</li>
      <li>My lips are darker than paler women and nude lipsticks are always too light.</li>
      <li>Glides on so smoothly, and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>but I find the products to be made with cheap ingredients and</li>
      <li>Light on the lips and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>and it applies so smooth.</li>
      <li>am of Latin descent and have olive undertones in my light tan skin.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, applies smoothly and feels great on my lips but doesn&#x27;t tend to last very long for me.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to receive my two NYX butter lipsticks.</li>
      <li>ITS VERY PRETTY</li>
      <li>This lipstick lasts a long time and has a good balance of moisturizers too.</li>
      <li>My new favorite lipstick (;</li>
      <li>Not like butter, because that wouldn&#x27;t last as long as this, but It feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more colors!</li>
      <li>Looks very natural, and is a perfect everyday color.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>It wears comfortably and is decent for staying power.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it so much since I received it and haven&#x27;t had any problems yet!</li>
      <li>I first saw it on my friend after she received it in her glam bag.</li>
      <li>The color pops is almost an exact dupe for the NARS rikugien pencil i got in the sephora birthday gift this year.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to invest in higher quality lip products where I don&#x27;t have these problems.</li>
      <li>It shipped fast and didn&#x27;t melt in transit!</li>
      <li>The staying power is pretty good too, it just needs a little touching up in the center of the lips after a couple hours or eating.</li>
      <li>Love the NYX line but just not stay on for long..</li>
      <li>My only complain is it lipstick itself is sensitive and can melt very easily.</li>
      <li>The color was mostly there, but I like the slight shine from a fresh application.</li>
      <li>MORE PINK...</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping</li>
      <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
      <li>natural looking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural on my lips</li>
      <li>This is probably as close to nude for me as I can get, just a little more pink.</li>
      <li>I know this goes against the many good reviews out there, but I still have to say, this product is terrible.  </li>
      <li>For some a lip liner may be needed to prevent feathering but other than that I really like it and would buy it again.</li>

<li> For some a lip liner may be needed to prevent feathering but other than that I really like it and would buy it again.</li>
<li> This one is very gritty on my lips and does not stay on as long.</li>
<li> I ordered this lipstick in the colors Pops and Licorice about three days ago and was happily surprised to find them in my mailbox after a day and a half.</li>
<li> This stuff stayed all night long, including drinking and eating.</li>
<li> Color (in low lighting) is what I expected.</li>
<li> Not too pink.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth like some other lipsticks do</li>
<li> I expected Pops to be a mauve type color and was a little disappointed that it ended up being more of a medium toned pink</li>
<li> Considering I hate lipstick though, I love this.</li>
<li> She wrote down the color and numbers for me and I of course went to Amazon.</li>
<li> you can use it when you dress up&amp; dress down</li>
<li> A little darker then i thought</li>
<li> and I think this will become my everyday lipstick.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve tried a few colors.  </li>
<li> I just feel like I wasted my money.</li>
<li> This lipstick will now be my everyday lippie</li>
<li> but better.&lt;br /&gt;The formula goes on buttery, takes a few coats with the lighter colors, but dries as a satin matte.</li>
<li> Also it is not sticky or heavy.</li>
<li> I would recommend this for someone who&#x27;s pale.</li>
<li> Use it everyday now!</li>
<li> I need to buy a few to keep on hand in case they run out!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried to like NYX products as they seem to be all the rage lately and they&#x27;re sold everywhere</li>
<li> The color is awful, it has no staying power and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it actually made my lips chapped.  </li>
<li> Maybe I just chose the wrong colors.</li>
<li> and I was so disappointed.</li>

    <li> Very complimentary color and silky  smooth! Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect color. Not too pink. Not too brown. Just right. Also it is not sticky or heavy. Light on the lips and goes on smooth. I first saw it on my friend after she received it in her glam bag. She wrote down the color and numbers for me and I of course went to Amazon. I need to buy a few to keep on hand in case they run out!</li>
    <li> Beautiful lipstick.  I got BLS 17 which a kind of maple and it is so rich and just gorgeous and it feels...just incredible.  Not like butter, because that wouldn&#x27;t last as long as this, but It feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite lipstick, not as pigmented as I prefer</li>
    <li> The color didn&#x27;t go well with my skin tone. I would recommend this for someone who&#x27;s pale.</li>
    <li> Fast service, great product</li>
    <li> God I love this color. It&#x27;s so natural on my lips and I think this will become my everyday lipstick. The color pops is almost an exact dupe for the NARS rikugien pencil i got in the sephora birthday gift this year.</li>
    <li> The color goes on  smooth(like butter) Color payoff is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been wearing it so much since I received it and haven&#x27;t had any problems yet! It doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth like some other lipsticks do so it stays in place, it&#x27;s a good color you can use it when you dress up&amp; dress down and overall I&#x27;ve found myself reaching for this product all the time.✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴</li>
    <li> BLS17 Pops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic lipstick! Glides on so smoothly, and lasts for hours. I wore it all day and only had to reapply three times after drinking. The color was mostly there, but I like the slight shine from a fresh application. The lipstick didn&#x27;t leave any residue before being re-applied. This is an issue I have had with Revlon lipsticks which are the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of Latin descent and have olive undertones in my light tan skin. My lips are darker than paler women and nude lipsticks are always too light. This is probably as close to nude for me as I can get, just a little more pink. I love it. Use it everyday now!</li>
    <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
    <li> Love the NYX line but just not stay on for long.. I&#x27;m constantly re applying!!! Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great nude color. Great texture. It shipped fast and didn&#x27;t melt in transit!</li>
    <li> Color is darker on that it appears in the tube.  Texture is good and no horrible smell!</li>
    <li> I got the color pops.. it&#x27;s a good nude on my lips.. like my lips but better.&lt;br /&gt;The formula goes on buttery, takes a few coats with the lighter colors, but dries as a satin matte. It wears comfortably and is decent for staying power. I can&#x27;t wait to try more colors!</li>
    <li> This lipstick will now be my everyday lippie and it applies so smooth. just exfoliate your lips prior to</li>
    <li> A little darker then i thought but i love the color either way. One of my favorite. My only complain is it lipstick itself is sensitive and can melt very easily.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive my two NYX butter lipsticks. I got them in the mail yesterday. I tried them both on and I was so disappointed. Maybe I just chose the wrong colors. I just feel like I wasted my money. I love makeup. So when you by lipstick and you don&#x27;t like it you are stuck with it. So it goes in the drawer of things I never wear and that&#x27;s where it stays till my momma or a friend of mine likes it and takes it with them.</li>
    <li> ITS GREAT AND A NUDE PINKISH COLOR..MORE PINK...ITS VERY PRETTY</li>
    <li> My new favorite lipstick (;</li>
    <li> Was not the same as the one I&lt;br /&gt;Originally feel in love with.  This one is very gritty on my lips and does not stay on as long. Never again!</li>
    <li> I know this goes against the many good reviews out there, but I still have to say, this product is terrible.  The color is awful, it has no staying power and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it actually made my lips chapped.  I&#x27;ve tried to like NYX products as they seem to be all the rage lately and they&#x27;re sold everywhere but I find the products to be made with cheap ingredients and the colors are way off, they don&#x27;t compliment my skin complexion and I&#x27;ve tried a few colors.  I&#x27;ll continue to invest in higher quality lip products where I don&#x27;t have these problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lipstick in the colors Pops and Licorice about three days ago and was happily surprised to find them in my mailbox after a day and a half. Licorice is going to be a great fall color (though I might start wearing it now even though it&#x27;s still summer...). I expected Pops to be a mauve type color and was a little disappointed that it ended up being more of a medium toned pink but it makes a great &amp;#34;my lips but better&amp;#34; type of color so I love it anyway! The staying power is pretty good too, it just needs a little touching up in the center of the lips after a couple hours or eating. All in all, a great lipstick and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more colors!</li>
    <li> Love the color. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. great formula. natural looking. love it.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful color but it melts off my lips</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, applies smoothly and feels great on my lips but doesn&#x27;t tend to last very long for me. Considering I hate lipstick though, I love this.</li>
    <li> I never wear lipstick but I recently wore this in red for a murder mystery. This stuff stayed all night long, including drinking and eating. I went to touch up and discovered I didn&#x27;t need to. I love this lipstick!</li>
    <li> This lipstick lasts a long time and has a good balance of moisturizers too. My lips don&#x27;t peel after I take this off.  I love the color.  For some a lip liner may be needed to prevent feathering but other than that I really like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Color (in low lighting) is what I expected. In direct sunlight, it&#x27;s a bit pink for me to pull off. Don&#x27;t be scared of this lipstick, in the tube and the tube color itself, Pops looks brown- it&#x27;s definitely not!</li>
    <li> Love the color and ease of application.</li>
    <li> Love the color of this lipstick! Name of this color is called Pops.  I have been searching for the dupe for the Kyle Jenner Lipstick look and THIS IS SO CLOSE!  I&#x27;m so excited!  I bought a second lipstick already for my friend who has been on the same hunt with me! The seller is kind and very quick to respond to any questions.  I will be ordering more of this lipstick as soon as I am out.</li>
