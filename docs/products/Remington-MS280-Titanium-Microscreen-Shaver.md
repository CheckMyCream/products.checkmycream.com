      <li>Remington MS280 is definitely an excellent electric shaver.</li>
      <li>This is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
      <li>At best the trimmer could be marketed as a \\&quot;grabber.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>A very wise purchase.</li>
      <li>This is a great razor.</li>
      <li>Read reviews and thought it would be a great purchase</li>
      <li>This is a great razor.</li>
      <li>The shipping was great</li>
      <li>Great shave.</li>
      <li>Great value.</li>
      <li>Great product and great price.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get a great, close shave.  </li>
      <li>it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good job.</li>
      <li>All things considered, this is a really good shaver.</li>
      <li>That said, this IS a darned good shaver, performance-wise.</li>
      <li>And that doesn&#x27;t do you much good while your shaving.</li>
      <li>Good:  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First though some good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits in my hand</li>
      <li>The razor fits my hand good.</li>
      <li>Gives a superior, close shave even when I go a day without shaving.  </li>
      <li>It seems to give me a good shave.</li>
      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with product.    </li>
      <li>Excellent, fast shipping, grandson loved it.</li>
      <li>and I think this one is looking to do a better job!</li>
      <li>Yes, it is louder than the others I have tried, but to me that means more Power!    </li>
      <li>For about $12.00 more than the cost of the blades/screen replacements, I purchased a new one and it works excellently.</li>
      <li>The price was good and the product was everything as spelled out in the original description.</li>
      <li>This electric shaver can quickly deliver a great shave and it&#x27;s cheap.    </li>
      <li>To top it off, you could not shave while it&#x27;s plugged in, so in order to finish the shave, I would have to wait around for it to charge.     </li>
      <li>I love this shaver and I bought another for my dad.</li>
      <li>Love the two-position pop-up trimmer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.    </li>
      <li>one that I have had for  10 years was better</li>
      <li>There are better alternatives out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face has been cut on more than one occasion.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Bought so many replacement screens I probably should have bought more shavers instead.</li>
      <li>and it irritated my skin a lot if I apply more pressure.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years, mine broke, ordered a replacement, I received the product in just a couple of days, in excellent condition.</li>
      <li>Better to avoid them.  </li>
      <li>but I get more than 6 months out of them.</li>
      <li>I love this razor.</li>
      <li>I have not had the greatest of luck with electric shavers over the years, so I guess I am not real surprised this one is</li>
      <li>All told it is still a pretty good value at the price</li>
      <li>However, Amazon nor Remington provide adequate or detail information for review/comparison between their own products, to enable anyone to make a side by side comparison comparison between models.  </li>
      <li>As best I can tell, the screens are only available in a package that includes the cutter blades</li>
      <li>AND they are available at most department stores.</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>Shaving comfort and results are excellent, after a little over a month of use.</li>
      <li>And don&#x27;t count on the trimmer to fix up those huge patches of untouched hair--it does not trim.  </li>
      <li>It shaves faster and every bit as close and comfortably as my Panasonic 8228 which was 4 times the cost.</li>
      <li>I greatly prefer Remington&#x27;s style of attached trimmer to the standard used by competitors.  </li>
      <li>item comes with a charging cord but no base.</li>
      <li>Still readily available on the Internet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately I have no meetings tomorrow, because my face looks something like the patchwork grasses on an arid savanna.  </li>
      <li>It does have a recharge light that goes off when the shaver has fully charged.    </li>
      <li>This is an old stand-by shaver for me and it was good to know I could get the replacement through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with with company and my new shaver.</li>
      <li>no irritation or break outs or anything.. very easy to use and clean and its shaves very close to the skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy and comfortable to use, the replacement foils/cutters are a true bargain compared to the Panasonics or Brauns...and it outperforms them too!</li>
      <li>My old Remington Titanium shaver does a great job, so I ordered a new one for my travel bag.</li>
      <li>The shaver feels comfortable in my right hand.  </li>
      <li>Screens broke quickly.</li>
      <li>and I find it useful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too powerful for you.    </li>
      <li>Is more noisy than my old one.  </li>
      <li>Rare problem, and</li>
      <li>After about 15 minutes worth of use</li>
      <li>But I could shave daily, but am best suited for a shave every 36 hours, or every other day.</li>
      <li>I have used several other electric razors and this gives me the best shave of them all.</li>
      <li>They develop holes in them pretty quick.</li>
      <li>But if you have decent hand-eye coordination and you can understand the phrase \\&quot;moderate pressure\\&quot;, then this shaver is as good as it gets.    </li>
      <li>the price is right</li>
      <li>If you buy a shaver and you don&#x27;t like it right away</li>
      <li>I have used every type of electric shaver from every major brand, and I have settled on this as the most efficient in terms of cost, time, and results.      </li>
      <li>In the hands of a skilled chef, a sharp kitchen knife yields quick, precise, and efficient results.  </li>
      <li>is a better alternative for a similar price range:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>It works OK, but not like the last one I had.  </li>
      <li>and I expect this one to provide for the same level of demands. : )</li>
      <li>The first charge takes hours and hours.</li>
      <li>the first set of foils lasted about a month.   </li>
      <li>This shaver only works OK.  </li>
      <li>- Reasonably priced  - Attached trimmer works very well  - Ergonomic design  - Very compact (good for those with small hands)  - Can clean and rinse blades and screen in water    </li>
      <li>Overall a great shaver that I am fully satisfied with also considering the price definitely lower than other equivalent shavers.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that the blade screens are not as easy to replace as the instructions indicate.  </li>
      <li>The last one is still going strong after 2 years, I just wanted a backup shaver.</li>
      <li>It can miss a hair in certain spots, and you should check your face, and use the trimmer to get those stubborn hairs.</li>
      <li>Make it have a certain life to make you buy another.  </li>
      <li>The razor gives a very close shave and a charge lasts for days, I can easly get 5 or more shaves with a single charge.</li>
      <li>Yes, it may be loud, but I think it&#x27;s because of a powerful motor.  </li>
      <li>Another plus: the replacement foils/cutters are quite reasonably priced at around 20 bucks...</li>
      <li>Pro: This shaver gives a very close shave...    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, mine broke, ordered a replacement, I received the product in just a couple of days, in excellent condition. I am very satisfied with with company and my new shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver only works OK.  Pulls instead of cutting.  Does not shave as close as my 7 year old one.  Is more noisy than my old one.  Takes longer to shave than my old one.  Will shave if plugged in reguardless of battery condition.</li>
    <li> Pro: This shaver gives a very close shave...    Con: ... to about forty percent of your face.  The rest is going to be randomly either chopped up, or more likely, completely untouched despite repeated passes.  And don&#x27;t count on the trimmer to fix up those huge patches of untouched hair--it does not trim.  At best the trimmer could be marketed as a \\&quot;grabber.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not half bad at yanking hair out of your face.     After about 15 minutes worth of use I literally had to retrieve my broken, rusty trimmer from the trash can, clean it off, and finish the job.  Fortunately I have no meetings tomorrow, because my face looks something like the patchwork grasses on an arid savanna.  If I could make a Video Review of my face, Remington would probably initiate a product recall...     Conclusion:  Buy this shaver if you hate yourself.</li>
    <li> i received the item in a timely manner and it was as described. no parts missing and it works like a charm. good job.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with the performance of the Panasonic shaver that I bought.  I found this Remington for $26 and based on previous experience with Remington, I bought it.    It is not as quiet as a blade or a Norelco.  Duhh.    It shaves close, so close you may draw blood if you use it improperly.  If you draw blood, you have gone beyond shaving your beard and are now removing skin.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of pressure.  Move a little slower to get that closer shaver.    A triple foil shaver would be the only improvement, but at a higher price.  I have one and compared it to this shaver.  The triple foil gives a quicker shave, but that&#x27;s the only advantage.    If I had to buy another shaver, this would be it.  This model or one above it.</li>
    <li> It works fine. It seems to give me a good shave.Very pleased with the product.It&#x27;s an improvement over the last one I bought thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product.    Determined that the two larger shaving foil(s) probably equal the surface area of the older three-foil Remingtons.    However, Amazon nor Remington provide adequate or detail information for review/comparison between their own products, to enable anyone to make a side by side comparison comparison between models.  Not until I received the product did I discover it is battery operation ONLY (when the batteries in my old Remington started to bite the dust, I always had to finish up by hooking the AC back up to finish shaving - cost of replacing the batteries, service and shipping cost as much as a new razor).      Secondly, while I don&#x27;t need it (due to previous Remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned), it did not come with the \\&quot;deluxe travel pouch\\&quot;, which Remington says that this model comes with.    The only other negative to the shaver is it&#x27;s on/off switch.  It is a rubber membrane covered push-button type switch that is VERY firm to try and push.  If you have sore thumbs, forget it, or plan on using two hands.    Shaving comfort and results are excellent, after a little over a month of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blackman&#x27;s razor when it was electrical and I purchased a cordless one and believe it or not, I&#x27;m still using my electric razor from the 50&#x27;s and now i&#x27;m using the newer razor as a back up and I find it useful. Anyone who has a problem with it must not know how to shave withit. Like I said, I&#x27;m still useing my old Remington  that&#x27;s over 50 years old.</li>
    <li> Gives a superior, close shave even when I go a day without shaving.  The shaver feels comfortable in my right hand.  Love the two-position pop-up trimmer.  Yes, it may be loud, but I think it&#x27;s because of a powerful motor.  My old one (had for years) needed replacement so I immediately bought a second one.  It is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only drawback is that the blade screens are not as easy to replace as the instructions indicate.  Replacement screens &amp; blades are available at my local Target store and maybe other stores as well but I&#x27;ve never looked.  Shopped all online outlets and Amazon had the best price.  The charging cord is coiled like a telephone cord so it stays neat.</li>
    <li> Had it for quite some time now and it has not lost charge and works perfectly.  I had another before this one and I think this one is looking to do a better job!</li>
    <li> This is my second MS-280. My first one was purchased at least 5 years ago and for some reason was no longer providing a very close shave, even after replacement of the blades &amp; screen. For about $12.00 more than the cost of the blades/screen replacements, I purchased a new one and it works excellently. I have tried a Braun single foil and a Norelco with the 3 spinning blades, but neither shaves nearly as close or as quickly as the Remington. Yes, it is louder than the others I have tried, but to me that means more Power!    As for the replacement blades and screen they do seem expensive ($20. for both?) but I get more than 6 months out of them. So I&#x27;m probably paying $25 or $30 / year in parts. This recurring cost will put some folks off, but I do like this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor in the past with good results, so when it was time to purchase a new razor, I went back to this one.  It works OK, but not like the last one I had.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is just a hit-and-miss issue, or if they have cheapened their cost somehow, but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed.  All told it is still a pretty good value at the price</li>
    <li> Dicount Jungle is selling Remington MS-280 shavers the do not include the head guard or the cleaning brush. By the MS-390 or buy from some other source!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor 11 months ago, and now I am shopping for a replacement.  After about 8 months of daily use, the battery wore down so much that if I didn&#x27;t charge it daily, the blades would slow.  After 11 months, even continuous charging while not in use is not enough to keep it a full speed throughout a shave. The blades have also become dull enough to be a problem during this period.    Aside from the battery and blades wearing down, it works well.  I greatly prefer Remington&#x27;s style of attached trimmer to the standard used by competitors.  The standard attached trimmer used by Panasonic, Brawn, and just about everyone else doesn&#x27;t work well with my style of curly/wavy hair.  So I&#x27;ll probably buy a similar model Remington as a replacement, in spite of the short life.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time, packed well, and met all expectations.  This is an old stand-by shaver for me and it was good to know I could get the replacement through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Instead of giving a long-winded review, I&#x27;ve broken the pros and cons down into a list for easy viewing.    Good:  - Gives a close shave  - Reasonably priced  - Attached trimmer works very well  - Ergonomic design  - Very compact (good for those with small hands)  - Can clean and rinse blades and screen in water    Bad:  - It may cut too closely until you get used to it  - Blades and screen are difficult to find and are expensive  - Won&#x27;t work well for left-handed individuals (the design assumes you&#x27;re right-handed)   - People with large hands may find it difficult to use  - Trimmer is too wide to use for fine details  - Not a wet/dry model  - Relatively short battery life with no low-battery indicator  - Cannot run razor using the charging chord</li>
    <li> Ok, the title is a bit harsh but there are few qualities that this shaver possesses that makes it a worthwhile purchase. If there is such thing as a de-evolution (product that goes back in time rather than improve), this product is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried and owned shavers from Norelco, Braun, Remmington, and Panasonic in the past 23 years (gulp!). Don&#x27;t worry, my horse and buggy have been traded in for a Hybrid Vehicle. LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item comes with a charging cord but no base. It is at least accompanied with a carrying case. The shaving head has two foils that flex with contact but do not swivel. The item is not submersible and therefore, it is not a wet/dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation is quite simple. An on/off switch and a trimmer button give simplicity in design. The handle is ergonomic and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts close. Too close that is. My face has been cut on more than one occasion. The contact on my face also causes irritation and burning. I have a better experience dry shaving with a conventional razor. Outside of a less than pleasant shave due to much irritation, the noise is unbearable. It is the noisiest shaver I have ever had a chance to try. Run time on a recharge is about 5-7 days depending upon the density of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The money you save on the shaver is offset by antiseptic solution and bandages. This is not a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down. Do your face a favor and avoid this shaver. There are better alternatives out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably meets the criteria for the worst shaver of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a better alternative for a similar price range:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001FA1F8K Braun Series 1  1-150 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> i have been using this model since 2009 and im very happy with it... no irritation or break outs or anything.. very easy to use and clean and its shaves very close to the skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for years but wanted a second electric shaver for travel (and to see what I might be missing).  I saw this Remington, looked at the price and made the purchase. I&#x27;m glad I did.    Pros  The price is unbeatable. I did not have to take out a second mortgage to buy this shaver.  You&#x27;ll get a great, close shave.  It&#x27;s a tough, no frills shaver. Think muscle car and manual SLR.    Cons  The first charge takes hours and hours. (After that, perfect.)  It&#x27;s loud. Some neighbors might think that you&#x27;re mowing your lawn. The crazier ones will wonder why you put sod down in your bathroom. Better to avoid them.  It&#x27;s not a toy. Press too hard against your skin, and shaving becomes surgery.     Bottom line: Would I purchase it again? You bet. Great value. Great shave.</li>
    <li> This is the exact same razor that I currently have. I bought this one to travel with. The shipping was great the price is right and I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington ms280 shaver thinking it was like the one I have which is a ms2 290. They look the same. My MS2 290 wore the on off switch out which is the only complaint I have with it. If it was located some other place it would last forever. I had heard that the ms280 was loud,and not very powerful at times. After a few months mine was loud and I thought I was losing power, so one day I put a screw in the on off switch on the ms2 290 and what a difference that I had not noticed. It was twice as powerful, twice as quiet, and so much smoother.I put the MS280 away and am using the MS2 290 screw and all. People don&#x27;t realize men could really care less what a shaver costs as long as it does the job, with the leat amount of pain and trouble. My thought was if there is a new shaver on the market their old one never worked, but in the case of the MS2 290 there is no need to sell any other. If you buy a shaver and you don&#x27;t like it right away you will never like it so take it back.</li>
    <li> The  MS280  I received would not hold a charge even after six (6)  24 hour charges.&lt;br /&gt;My old MS280 shaver  ( one that I have had for  10 years was better but  the  pop-up trimmer  no longer worked)&lt;br /&gt;That is the reason I ordered a New  MS280 shaver  as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver with the hope of getting more life out of the foils due to it&#x27;s &#x27;titanium-coated&#x27; foil. Well, forget that...the first set of foils lasted about a month.   And believe me, when they begin to wear through, you DO NOT want to keep using them. You may end up with nasty scratches on your face!   ((Mind you, I shave my head too, so your foil life may be longer than mine.))    That said, this IS a darned good shaver, performance-wise. It shaves faster and every bit as close and comfortably as my Panasonic 8228 which was 4 times the cost. Another plus: the replacement foils/cutters are quite reasonably priced at around 20 bucks...AND they are available at most department stores. (Unlike Panasonic.)    Ergonomically the shaver loses a point or two with the awkwardly-designed on/off switch. It seems to me like you must depress it further than necessary before it will &#x27;catch&#x27; in the on position. Admittedly this is a minor gripe.    The shaver is a bit &#x27;buzzy&#x27; and loud, so don&#x27;t try shaving when your wife or kids are still asleep. To me, another weakness is the length of recharge time...often the shaver will take 10-15 hours to recharge itself. It does have a recharge light that goes off when the shaver has fully charged.    All things considered, this is a really good shaver. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy and comfortable to use, the replacement foils/cutters are a true bargain compared to the Panasonics or Brauns...and it outperforms them too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband. He has had 6 Remingtons over  the past 25 years and always wanted his replacement razor to be like the one he had.  This razor shakes and vibrates like a lawn mower. What happened to Remington quality? We want a quality product like we used to get. Amazon sent us our order promptly but Remington let us down.</li>
    <li> Good buy. The price was good and the product was everything as spelled out in the original description. A very wise purchase.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is like a very sharp kitchen knife.  In the hands of a skilled chef, a sharp kitchen knife yields quick, precise, and efficient results.  In the hands of a novice, it yields bloody stumps where fingers used to be.    If you have terrible dexterity, skip this razor.  It&#x27;s too powerful for you.    But if you have decent hand-eye coordination and you can understand the phrase \\&quot;moderate pressure\\&quot;, then this shaver is as good as it gets.    I have used every type of electric shaver from every major brand, and I have settled on this as the most efficient in terms of cost, time, and results.      In 3 minutes, this will deliver what takes over 5 minutes with a $130 electric shaver.  And instead of hassling with blade replacements and deteriorating battery life, you can just buy a new razor every few months because the MS280 is so darned cheap.    Bottom line:   This electric shaver can quickly deliver a great shave and it&#x27;s cheap.    All around, it&#x27;s the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington shaver of this style I have purchased. The last one is still going strong after 2 years, I just wanted a backup shaver. The razor gives a very close shave and a charge lasts for days, I can easly get 5 or more shaves with a single charge. It can go longer but you can tell the razor is slowing down after the 5th shave. The only con is the razor is very loud. I have used several other electric razors and this gives me the best shave of them all. If this model is still around when I am ready to purchase a new razor, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Remington MS280 is definitely an excellent electric shaver. It gives you very close shave without any irritation to the skin. I had a bitter experience with Braun shaver before, I couldn&#x27;t complete shaving at least once with that and it irritated my skin a lot if I apply more pressure. I know elecric shavers requires a little skill and each shaver will differ on how much pressure you apply to have a closer shave. Remington definitely suits me, I can have a very close shave within minutes with out any irritation. I love this shaver and I bought another for my dad.</li>
    <li> After battling acne for I don&#x27;t know how long, I finally found a solution that works for me. I had been using disposable razors with shaving cream about every 2 days and my face would always be irritated with ugly zits around my nose and chin. Sometimes it even made shaving difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I was fed up so I purchased this Remington MS280 rechargeable shaver. It has been at least 6 weeks now and have not even seen a single zit! This thing lets you shave without irritating your face or introducing nasty chemicals (shaving cream or gel). Plus it gives a nice close shave in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Remington!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Remington shavers for quite a long time and I must admit that the quality of their shaving keeps going down with each new model they bring out. This one was not an exception.  I&#x27;m sad to admit this may be the last one I buy.  Most annoying characteristics of this model are the coiled electric cord (impossible to shave with it plugged in),  and the fact that one cannot shave with the unit plugged in if the battery is completely drained.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for 5 yrs. It has provided quality shaves, lasts for weeks without needing a charge and I expect this one to provide for the same level of demands. : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors all my life so I am aware each one has a little different cut and your face takes some time getting comfortable with each one.  I&#x27;ve given this one about 2 months and it&#x27;s going in the trash.  I have 3 main problems with this unit.    1.  It&#x27;s very loud and I get ready before my wife wakes up.  Don&#x27;t expect to use this while your partner sleeps.  I thought I had the foil or the cutting blades on wrong but after seeing other reviews mention how loud it is, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a very loud unit.      2.  If you have anything more than a day or two&#x27;s worth of growth, the regular cutting surface will not handle it.  Shaving would take me at least 15 minutes since I had to shave twice, first using the extending cutting blade to shave off anything more than about 1/16\\&quot; of hair. Once the longer hairs were cut off, the shave is uncomfortable since the razor would pitch and pull the hairs despite being a new blade.  Shaving got to be such a long, painful, and loud task, I found myself putting it off but then when I finally shaved it would take even longer since I had to use the extending cutting blade before shaving.      3.  Sometimes it would run out of charge while I was shaving and it would snag and pinch the hairs which is very painful.  To top it off, you could not shave while it&#x27;s plugged in, so in order to finish the shave, I would have to wait around for it to charge.     Terrible unit.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product prior to ordering this one.  Simply wore the old one out.  This is the best electric razor I have ever owned.  Closest shave possible...even from much more expensive razors.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you.  This is a great razor.</li>
    <li> Got about 10 year use out of my two trusty ms280s until they would not turn on anymore. Yes the micro screens seemed to get holes but thats due to blood which will eat through about anything chromed or painted. Punch on/off both fell out but the button was still underneath. Bought so many replacement screens I probably should have bought more shavers instead. Now I had to buy a Remington F series (F4), not as good a shave, recharges quicker, more awkward shape to hold. In general, Remington is probably the brand I will use for awhile, not impressed with Norelco, and hate traditional razor shaving and the mess.</li>
    <li> My old Remington Titanium shaver does a great job, so I ordered a new one for my travel bag. It cuts close, just like the old one, but it is so loud that it hurts my ears. I&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s way over the industrial threshhold for \\&quot;Hearing Protection Required\\&quot;. If OSHA visited my home, they&#x27;d make me post a warning sign.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a spare or backup if my 390 takes a dive. After two years the 390 is of other than the fact the trimmer is mostly useless (dull cutter) after much use. The main reason I got the 390 over the 280 was the ability to use and charge the cells (two AA&#x27;s) at the same time. Something you can&#x27;t do with the 280 which is the major difference between the two other than price.    Both shavers appear to be the exact same model other than the charging circuit and charging &#x27;wall brick&#x27;. Different voltages and plugs on each charger. Both use two AA cells (unknown if NiCd or NiMH).     Pros;  1. Price (almost half the price of the 390),  2. Decent shave if you use &#x27;foil&#x27; shavers as opposed to rotary or blades,  3. Ability to change one screen and/or blade as opposed to both. Older, original Remington design made you change out both foils which many times was unnecessary usually only one wares through,  4.  Power supply/ charger is a &#x27;switching&#x27; type of supply, not a heavy, older school &#x27;transformer&#x27;.    Cons,    1. Noisy,  2. Can&#x27;t recharge and use shaver at the same time,  3. Can&#x27;t replace the two AA cells (1100MA capacity). You can&#x27;t get the whole unit apart without damaging the bottom case cap since it appears to be glued or secured somehow together preventing the two &#x27;halves&#x27; from coming apart,  4. No charged indicator and long charge time (16 hours).   5. Typical &#x27;made in China&#x27; from some unknown company imported by some never heard of company that bought the Remington name,  6. No case.    Regarding reviews stating the problem with the shaver &#x27;biting&#x27;. Do you use a &#x27;pre shave&#x27; conditioner? I have done so for decades since my skin is sensitive. It usually takes at least a week (sometimes a month as some manufactures recommend) to get use to a different shaver especially if you never used a electric before.</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast shipping, grandson loved it.</li>
    <li> Screens broke quickly. Manual did not have instructions to replace screens. Replacement screens (and cutters) close to price of new razor. Marketing strategy? Feeling manipulated into buying new razor instead of replacement parts; not very green.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I get a fast close shave for a fraction of the cost of those expensive foreign razors. It shaves closer than my old rotary razor. I charge it on Sunday and it lasts all week. The razor fits my hand good. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the loudest shaver I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  I decided not to even try to use it because it was so loud that it hurt my ears.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for 2 years without an issue. I am not a 5 O&#x27;Clock Shadow guy. But I could shave daily, but am best suited for a shave every 36 hours, or every other day. No problems. I would like to know how much juice is left for charging. But I usually can tell when shaving when it&#x27;s getting close to needing a charge.  My biggest complaint is the inability to use the cord when the shaver is very low, or out of juice. It&#x27;s good to work the battery and run it down low, which the instructions tell you to do every 6 months. And will extend the life of the battery, and shaver.  And that doesn&#x27;t do you much good while your shaving. Lets say you shave half your face, and it runs out of juice. Then what? Unless you have a second shaver you are SOL. And trying to charge it for 45 minutes will not get the job done. Rare problem, and I do have an ancient SLR 800 that can finish the job.    I never leave the shaver on charge between shaves. It only goes on charge when the battery is low.  I have no issues with it&#x27;s shaving ability. It can miss a hair in certain spots, and you should check your face, and use the trimmer to get those stubborn hairs. You can also back the razor away from your face, and lightly work some of those tough whiskers off without the trimmer.   I can also go 3, or 4 days without a shave, and this razor still does the job.  I also dropped it once from about 4 feet, it hit the bathroom floor tile, one of the blades popped off, and it was just running away. No sign that it was damaged. Picked the blade up, put it back on the post, and ready to go.  One more knock, and this complaint goes back to the days of the old Remington SLR series. The posts are a somewhat soft plastic, and can wear overtime, and not hold the blade in place very well. I noticed that with my old SLR, and after dropping this one (DUH). They should make the plastic post sturdier.   And last, although no Electric Manufacturer wants to do this because they want you to buy anew shaver every five years, is to be able to replace the old battery. With that, and a beefier blade post, these razors would never wear out. But in this disposable world we live in today that won&#x27;t happen.   When Remington had there little service centers, I remember one of the Clerks telling me that Remington thought the old SLR 800&#x27;s were out there to long, and they didn&#x27;t want that. Surprise. Make it have a certain life to make you buy another.  What a world we live in today.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The battery last very long; I have this shaver now for more than 4 years and the buttery still works for long time after each charge. The only drawback that I can see is that the foil is quite fragile and if the shaver is dropped even from small height the foil can be damaged. Overall a great shaver that I am fully satisfied with also considering the price definitely lower than other equivalent shavers.</li>
    <li> Read reviews and thought it would be a great purchase but it wasn&#x27;t!  He hated it, pinched and did not remove hair at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad. He loves it. Its just like the one his brother uses and he has had his for years. Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Very loud motor. hair cutter stocks (doesn&#x27;t come up to use)</li>
    <li> I had one given to me for chrismas a few years back then my xwife dropped it and messed up the foils and then the battery stopped charging. This one is holding the charge longer than the one I had before .</li>
    <li> I have not had the greatest of luck with electric shavers over the years, so I guess I am not real surprised this one is sort of so-so. I have had mine for several years. I think I got it at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First though some good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits in my hand comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any trouble with the battery charging or being charged enough to finish shaving. I leave it plugged in when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves pretty well as long as my beard is dry and not longish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be cleaned by rinsing the cutters and screen under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less than stellar things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber sleeve over the on/off button has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing off the screen works well but I still have to brush the cutters sometimes. I don&#x27;t think mine came with a brush for this purpose but I had one from the previous shaver that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutters and screen don&#x27;t last real long and have all but disappeared from local stores. Still readily available on the Internet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not work well when wet. If I rinse off the cutter and screen before shaving, it just does not shave well. Works fine dry though, as long as I have not let my beard grow out for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I let my beard grow out for a few days, it just does not cut the longer hairs reliably. I have to run over them with a separate trimmer first to get them short enough for the shaver to cut them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screens don&#x27;t last long - maybe 2 months. They develop holes in them pretty quick. Once that happens you are out of luck. As best I can tell, the screens are only available in a package that includes the cutter blades so I am forced to always replace and pay for both, even though the cutter blades seem fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the trimmer on mine no longer extends when I press the extend button. I can pry it out with my fingers, but the trimmer head does not seem to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experiences with it, I cannot really recommend it, although it does work and under the right conditions (dry and not too long) it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use mine about 6 or 7 months of the year as around Thanksgiving I start growing a beard that I don&#x27;t shave off until around Easter. I am not sure, but I think this is its 3rd season in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some other reviews complained it was noisy. I don&#x27;t see it as especially noisy, at least it is not so noisy it bothers me any.</li>
