      <li>It was gud right before christmas.</li>

      <li>However, I saw the 6.8 oz on here for a very reasonable price and figured I&#x27;d buy it; why not?  </li>
      <li>They were very nice about, I explained that I needed it within the next 2 days and offered to pay the shipment difference, though they wouldn&#x27;t accept my money and assured me it&#x27;d be here in the next two days,</li>
      <li>It was bigger dan expected but the gift was awsome in opening, very nice.</li>

      <li>very content thanks.</li>
      <li>Really pissed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the real thing...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many other things from here.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original and does not last at all.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Paris Hilton JM has a better scent overall compared to Perry Ellis Red</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>I used to use this cologne all of the time in high school</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a subtle fragrance</li>
      <li>probably a cheap watered down version!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent was nice, but I couldn&#x27;t give the perfume to my husband because it got broken when I tried to bring out the bottle and see how it looked.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use to use this back in high school.  </li>
      <li>What a waste, It doesn&#x27;t smell good and pretty much useless.</li>

<li> Long Lasting Fragance</li>
<li> This one that they sold me last a half hour.</li>
<li> The perfume is not original, smells just 10 minutes, I bought  the same perfume</li>
<li> I went and for the last few years I stopped looking until today when I found it on amazon</li>

<li> but then I tried a few dissentient ones for a couple years ranging in prices</li>

<li> Was I totally wrong and unhappy with this recent purchase.  </li>
<li> It came with the spray head broken and cannot spray</li>

<li> I was very unhappy and will not purchase any other colognes from amazon.  </li>
<li> I get complicated all the time.</li>
<li> They sold me a fake.</li>

    <li> Great price, delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Husbands trademark scent and so sexy!</li>
    <li> Love it and so does my lady!</li>
    <li> Daughter bought for her boyfriend as he had a smaller size that ran out. She bought it again as it smells fantastic.  Not too strong but earthy and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Ordered on Jan 4. And recieved on the 12 th, excellent smell fast shipping. I love otc trading</li>
    <li> excelente recomendado</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had before and this has the smell to a degree lower</li>
    <li> I used to use this cologne all of the time in high school but then I tried a few dissentient ones for a couple years ranging in prices but I always wanted to go back to 360 red, turns out I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere I went and for the last few years I stopped looking until today when I found it on amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> It came with the spray head broken and cannot spray</li>
    <li> This scent smells great and you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price. I bought this after hearing that it smells like the Wired cologne from Anchor Blue that is no longer available. I still have a small bottle of Wired and this does smell close, although not exactly. The scent of my Wired may have changed a bit over these years, this is definitely the closest scent I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> The perfume is not original, smells just 10 minutes, I bought  the same perfume but in 100ml presentation and smelled all day without incovinience.</li>
    <li> It was gud right before christmas. It was bigger dan expected but the gift was awsome in opening, very nice.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne. I constantly have women come up to me and tell me how good I smell. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
    <li> Comments from both men and women. .what are you wearing smells so good</li>
    <li> Long Lasting Fragance</li>
    <li> I would have given a 5star but for the bad package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was nice, but I couldn&#x27;t give the perfume to my husband because it got broken when I tried to bring out the bottle and see how it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging from the seller was really poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product if it is well packed.</li>
    <li> 6.8 ounce for that price is a good deal. The scent is retained for much longer time and some of my friends have complemented me that I smell good.</li>
    <li> Nice product..larger then what I expected!!! smells soooo good</li>
    <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne I have ever found. It makes me smell wonderful and I get compliments on it regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it&#x27;s like putting on deodorant for me. I can&#x27;t leave out of my house without smelling good and this fragrance goes well with my body chemistry. Bottles arrived on time and in great condition. I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
    <li> citrus&lt;br /&gt;aromatic&lt;br /&gt;warm spicy&lt;br /&gt;fresh spicy&lt;br /&gt;cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve compared Acqua Di Gio next to Perry Ellis Red ,and Paris Hilton Just Me.&lt;br /&gt;they all three have similar scents&lt;br /&gt;I prefer ADG for sure ,much more clean and refined smell.&lt;br /&gt;Perry ellis has a very spicy and cinnamon strong notes dominate once it dries down it shines..&lt;br /&gt;Paris Hilton JM has a better scent overall compared to Perry Ellis Red but it lacks longevity and projection .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall  I do recommend Perry Ellis Red even as a blind buy&lt;br /&gt;Especially if your a fan of ADG or cinnamon notes.</li>
    <li> You get a ton for a pretty cheap price. At first I wasn&#x27;t that impressed. However, I started taking it for what it is.  A lot of cologne with an tolerable smell.  I use it at the gym or when I&#x27;m doing outside work.  Or cooking in the kitchen.  Sprayed it on some of my jackets.</li>
    <li> I receiver what I order and it is perfect, I have no complain at all about the product itself or the package. Totally worth it</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume and it smells awesome, I was very disappointed do to the fact that usps damaged it, it was all over the place, I directly contacted the shipper and explained what happened and that I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend. They were very nice about, I explained that I needed it within the next 2 days and offered to pay the shipment difference, though they wouldn&#x27;t accept my money and assured me it&#x27;d be here in the next two days, very content thanks.</li>
    <li> Really pissed.Don&#x27;t purchase from De Glamorous. They sold me a fake. I love the cologne and i know that this scent especially last all day on me. This one that they sold me last a half hour. Andddd i got the 6.8 once. Staying clear of them in the future.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve order over 8 times, fast and just what i wanted</li>
    <li> As described and the best price around!</li>
    <li> I love it. I have been using it everyday. The women at work love it. I get complicated all the time. Its a lite scent, clean smelling. I bought the big bottle too 6.8 oz, I feel it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband because he was running very low on his.  This is the cologne he wears.  We usually buy a 3.4 oz at Marshalls for 30.00.  However, I saw the 6.8 oz on here for a very reasonable price and figured I&#x27;d buy it; why not?  I&#x27;ve purchased so many other things from here.  Was I totally wrong and unhappy with this recent purchase.  It&#x27;s not the real thing...probably a cheap watered down version!  It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original and does not last at all.  My husband wears this cologne all the time and always receives compliments.  Even after a long day at work; he still smells nice when he gets home.  So not true with this purchase.  I was very unhappy and will not purchase any other colognes from amazon.  I can&#x27;t believe they actually sale imitations!</li>
    <li> I use to use this back in high school.  Always got complimented on it by women.  I had bought one on ebay but it didn&#x27;t smell the same.  So I decided to try Amazon.  The cologne I bought was shipped and sold by amazon so I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference.  It arrived and it smelled great.  Been wearing it to work and the women at my work love smelling me.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> What a waste, It doesn&#x27;t smell good and pretty much useless. Its just going into the trash.</li>
    <li> This man&#x27;s fragrance arrived on time and intact. It&#x27;s kind of a subtle fragrance and it will draw compliments. I like it.</li>
