      <li>Worked Great!</li>
      <li>Worked great!</li>
      <li>Works great when bleaching hair.</li>
      <li>Good pricing for a great product</li>
      <li>whenever I do my own hair, that&#x27;s all I use as well.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>and I love how who ever ships it</li>
      <li>Love this developer, it always works well and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Went fine with toner and bleach</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years because the creme developer  (peroxide)  is much softer on the hair than the watery kind.</li>
      <li>Used it with Color Charm T18 White Lady - turned out beautiful but was very drying</li>
      <li>exactly what i was looking for and on time dlivery.</li>
      <li>im buying the 32 oz bottle next :) would definitely recommend as a developer. :)</li>
      <li>very well!</li>
      <li>I expected a chemical product o be packaged more carefuly</li>
      <li>Go to Sally Beauty and get advice if you have to - or look online, but like I said, ALWAYS use professional stuff - and in particular, NEVER use Garnier hair dye, I love their conditioners because can work miracles (especially damage eraser - if you have split ends or frizzy hair, use it, you&#x60;ll it!!)</li>
      <li>Ps - if you are going to dye your hair at home, ALWAYS use professional color.</li>
      <li>Product works as expected, fast shipping</li>

<li> One small negaive point was the packaging.</li>
<li> not potent smelling a+</li>
<li> It sticks to your hair in the worst way possible and it is known for coloring your hair unevenly, so just don&#x27;t even bother.</li>

    <li> Used it with Color Charm T18 White Lady - turned out beautiful but was very drying and I have oily hair.</li>
    <li> Worked Great! Went fine with toner and bleach</li>
    <li> Works just as it&#x27;s supposed to. I used well T18 with this developer, and it worked as it said it would-- very well!</li>
    <li> Recommended...LoveIt!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years because the creme developer  (peroxide)  is much softer on the hair than the watery kind.</li>
    <li> Love it. Inexpensive and I love how who ever ships it, tapes the bottle close so I don&#x27;t get a leaky bottle. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Love this. Worked in a hair salon as a receptionist and all the salon used was Wella, so whenever I do my own hair, that&#x27;s all I use as well. Love this developer, it always works well and leaves my hair shiny. Ps - if you are going to dye your hair at home, ALWAYS use professional color. ALWAYS. Never, ever, ever use box color. Go to Sally Beauty and get advice if you have to - or look online, but like I said, ALWAYS use professional stuff - and in particular, NEVER use Garnier hair dye, I love their conditioners because can work miracles (especially damage eraser - if you have split ends or frizzy hair, use it, you&#x60;ll it!!) but the hair stylists I&#x27;ve worked with have constantly said Garnier is the absolute WORST hair dye anyone could use, especially if you mess up and need to go to a salon to get a color correct.

    <li> worked well with the wella charm toner #t14</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for and on time dlivery. Very happy with this purchase. One small negaive point was the packaging. It came in an envelope! I expected a chemical product o be packaged more carefuly</li>
    <li> Product works as expected, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good pricing for a great product</li>
    <li> Worked great! I will use it again if the yellow in my white hair returns.</li>
    <li> The developer will be watery if its been in the bottle. Just shake it. Works great when bleaching hair. I like the way they put tape of the cap part to prevent from spills during the shipment!</li>
    <li> this creme developer worked perfectly with my wella t18 toner! im buying the 32 oz bottle next :) would definitely recommend as a developer. :)</li>
    <li> Creamy texture blends well not potent smelling a+</li>
