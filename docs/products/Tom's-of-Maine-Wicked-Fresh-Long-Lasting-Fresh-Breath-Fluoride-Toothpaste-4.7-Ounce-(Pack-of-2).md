<ol>
      <li>Best toothpaste in the world.</li>
      <li>Great taste!</li>
      <li>This is the best toothpaste!</li>
      <li>Good product, happy with purchase!</li>
      <li>We buy it because of the great rating on the EWG.org website.</li>
      <li>This is great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I think this toothpaste is among the best of the many versions produced by Colgate under the Tom&#x27;s brand.</li>
      <li>Excellent toothpaste and even better</li>
      <li>Formula has changed, but taste is still good....</li>
      <li>Good flavor.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>The flavor is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn my tongue like some toothpastes can, yet there is still a strong bite that gives you that feeling of freshness.</li>
      <li>Pleasant flavor of mild spearmint with a hint of vanilla or licorice.</li>
      <li>Much better than sugary toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it had Fluoride in it, but that was my mistake. :)</li>
      <li>I love the scent and taste.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use most brands of toothpaste because my mouth has a reaction to them.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER</li>
      <li>that is it cruelty free!</li>
      <li>It tastes great, leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours, and my teeth and mouth feel so clean.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good toothpaste, but with the term &amp;#34;wicked&amp;#34; in the title to me that implies a strong flavor and that it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>Love how it makes my mouth feel so clean for hours.</li>
      <li>and I like a strong mint or spearmint flavor.</li>
      <li>As far as a more natural, no harmful chemicals toothpaste, this is great!  </li>
      <li>No weird taste, just a nice mint (and I&#x27;m not a mint fan at all) flavour.</li>
      <li>Taste is fine and does the job without any complaints</li>
      <li>I also love the winter fresh flavor.  </li>
      <li>The most wonderful toothpaste in the whole wide world....,</li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>just much thinner, and not as bright white.</li>
      <li>Overall this is pretty good, I&#x27;m glad I got it although I may try another brand next time around.</li>
      <li>Toms wicked fresh provided me with exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Some, but not too much SLS.</li>
      <li>I also prefer Spearmint by far over the usual peppermint flavor of most toothpastes, and this seemed to fit the bill on both accounts.</li>
      <li>This flavour is the only flavour I use, and it leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent, but I like Tom&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This seemed like a decent deal for two tubes.</li>
      <li>I have used Toms of Main for years.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an organic toothpaste I highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Contains xylitol, a natural sweetener that inhibits bacteria, and which was present in the original Tom&#x27;s formula.</li>
      <li>Simply White better as it&#x27;s a little stronger</li>
      <li>For years I had a skin reaction around my mouth to something in the more common toothpastes (Aim, Pepsodent, Colgate Sensitive).  </li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>It left my breath feeling fresh and even cleaner than traditional toothpaste.</li>
      <li>seems to be the only toothpaste that has different flavors without being full of chemicals or tasting gross or being for kids (ick bubblegum).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like that so much because it retains it shape instead of squishing down as you use the paste.</li>

    <li> No flouride but still freshens breath... wow</li>
    <li> This seemed like a decent deal for two tubes. I wanted a natural toothpaste because I hate the saccharin sweetness that a lot of mainstream brands have. I also prefer Spearmint by far over the usual peppermint flavor of most toothpastes, and this seemed to fit the bill on both accounts. The flavor is great, it doesn&#x27;t burn my tongue like some toothpastes can, yet there is still a strong bite that gives you that feeling of freshness. I don&#x27;t love how foamy it is, foam doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with cleanliness, so I just find overly foamy personal products annoying. I also wish it had a little grit to it, but I&#x27;m admittedly used to using baking soda toothpaste. Overall this is pretty good, I&#x27;m glad I got it although I may try another brand next time around.</li>

    <li> Pleasant flavor of mild spearmint with a hint of vanilla or licorice. Contains xylitol, a natural sweetener that inhibits bacteria, and which was present in the original Tom&#x27;s formula. Some, but not too much SLS. Contains fluoride to fight cavities. I think this toothpaste is among the best of the many versions produced by Colgate under the Tom&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> For years I had a skin reaction around my mouth to something in the more common toothpastes (Aim, Pepsodent, Colgate Sensitive).  I finally went to the dermatologist, and he suggested I try Tom&#x27;s, along with some ointment.  The reaction (red, dry skin around the sides of my mouth) went away within a few days, and since I&#x27;ve stopped the ointment, it&#x27;s stayed away.  I can&#x27;t guarantee that the toothpaste alone did the trick, but it seems to have helped.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!  Love how it makes my mouth feel so clean for hours.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste and even better that is it cruelty free!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste in the world. This flavour is the only flavour I use, and it leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. No weird taste, just a nice mint (and I&#x27;m not a mint fan at all) flavour.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use most brands of toothpaste because my mouth has a reaction to them.  I like Toms as a replacement for the Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste that I used to use that isn&#x27;t made anymore.</li>
    <li> Taste is fine and does the job without any complaints but I was disappointed that I ordered this because it has flouride.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste! Showed up on time as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good toothpaste, but with the term &amp;#34;wicked&amp;#34; in the title to me that implies a strong flavor and that it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s decent, but I like Tom&#x27;s Simply White better as it&#x27;s a little stronger and I like a strong mint or spearmint flavor.</li>
    <li> This is great toothpaste. It left my breath feeling fresh and even cleaner than traditional toothpaste. I love the scent and taste.</li>
    <li> I have used Toms of Main for years.  I do not like peppermint and Toms seems to be the only toothpaste that has different flavors without being full of chemicals or tasting gross or being for kids (ick bubblegum). I also love the winter fresh flavor.  The tube now comes as a plastic tube.  I don&#x27;t like that so much because it retains it shape instead of squishing down as you use the paste.</li>
    <li> The most wonderful toothpaste in the whole wide world....,</li>
    <li> Good product, happy with purchase! Good flavor.</li>
    <li> Great taste! I didn&#x27;t realize it had Fluoride in it, but that was my mistake. :)</li>
    <li> Yuck, will never buy again. I have returned to Weleda!</li>
    <li> Formula has changed, but taste is still good....just much thinner, and not as bright white.</li>
    <li> Much better than sugary toothpastes.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste we buy.  We can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> I wanted an organic toothpaste, but was skeptical. Other organic products I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t work as well as my go to brands. I wanted something that left my mouth feeling fresh because my Crest Cavity protection wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. Toms wicked fresh provided me with exactly what I was looking for. It tastes great, leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours, and my teeth and mouth feel so clean. If you&#x27;re looking for an organic toothpaste I highly recommend this one.</li>
