      <li>This is a very light scent</li>
      <li>Inis is a beautiful, light, fresh summer scent.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>I have issues with getting headaches if I wear many perfumes</li>
      <li>I Love Inis......</li>
      <li>but I think it is more suited for a man.  </li>
      <li>I am more of a clean soapy or musk kind of girl.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean, feel nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of Cool Water Woman.</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds of cool waters, smells like grass and water if you can figure that one out.  </li>
      <li>This is truly a clean and refreshing aroma.</li>
      <li>I love this crispy clean fragrance</li>
      <li>Never thought I could find it so easily.  </li>
      <li>I felt it was too strong and medicinal smelling.</li>
      <li>but oh my goodness is it strong.</li>
      <li>it is more spicy than sweet.</li>
      <li>It has a fine mist spray but it fades away after a while but still stays on.</li>
      <li>Light and airy with hints of a deeper undertone.  </li>
      <li>I am the type who loves a light scent.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t smell cheap though.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh fragrance, but does not seem to have the staying power of sample</li>
      <li>This scent is amazing, clean fresh crisp.</li>
      <li>is unique to each person...  </li>
      <li>I was excited about this fragrance</li>
      <li>Delighted to discover it is available in the US... and even with shipping was the same price as I paid in Ireland!</li>
      <li>This is the most wonderful scent - crisp clean citrus in the top notes, some green florals in the middle, and a light woody drydown.</li>
      <li>I gave this to a girlfriend of mine and true story she was wearing it one day</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean scent.</li>
      <li>My new favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is nice enough.</li>
      <li>but it is my own personal opinion and scent</li>
      <li>They were right</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone who likes clean citrus scents -</li>
      <li>Very much a fragrance of the sea.</li>
      <li>So my thanks to those buyers for their prompt answers - it would have been a shame to miss out on this fragrance!</li>
      <li>Inis smells like many generic ocean/beach/marine scents on the market.</li>
      <li>Sticking with my higher end scents.</li>
      <li>Found it at the Irish fest and bought on Amazon for the convience and better price.</li>
      <li>Overall though I love the scent.</li>
      <li>Clean, marine aquatic that is pleasant, but in my opinion, not worth the raves, especially since the silage and lasting-power are nil.</li>
      <li>Wow I thought it was going to be unique.  </li>
      <li>I usually have issues with most perfumes as the majority of them smell cheap to me.</li>
      <li>Much like a CK1/Escape hybrid.</li>
      <li>Just received my Inis and it really was not what I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>Fast and well packaged.</li>
      <li>I really like this scent and it can be unisex.</li>
      <li>I really did not care for it</li>
      <li>Not necessarily a bad thing, you just have to make sure you use it in small doses.</li>
      <li>It is one of my new favorites!</li>
      <li>It does rub off on other people easily too.</li>
      <li>It certainly does not affect the overall fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I was surprised how big it really is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent at all.  </li>
      <li>Fragrances of Ireland web store offers samples of all of their fragrances for 2.00 shipping, which is in turn &#x27;reimbursed&#x27; with a 2.00 off coupon; I suggest you try before you buy</li>
      <li>I am surprised by the amount of people that like this scent.</li>
      <li>, I was surprised when she said she wore it.</li>
      <li>but it smells too masculine, too common and too cheap.  </li>

<li> I think has the day wears on this fragrance becomes subtle and fresh.  </li>
<li> I gave a 4 because the scent just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> , I get a tiny hint of it when the fragrance drys down, but I think that may be because I&#x27;m looking for it.</li>
<li> I do one small squirt holding it</li>
<li> wished it was a little less expensive</li>
<li> I was hesitant about buying it because clove was listed as a base note, and that&#x27;s a scent I really dislike.</li>
<li> Not good.  </li>
<li> I like the concept, indeed just about everything behind this fragrance, just not sold on the fragrance itself.</li>
<li> Seriously... I can find almost anything my heart desires on Amazon!</li>
<li> Was fearful that would be my one and only bottle.</li>
<li> Well needless to say I was wrong</li>

    <li> Wow I thought it was going to be unique.  Not so.  My son said that it is a man&#x27;s scent.  Not good.  He did not want.  Room freshener??</li>
    <li> Love the fresh fragrance, but does not seem to have the staying power of sample I experience on the east coast.🌊</li>
    <li> Excellent response to my order.  Great value.  Will definitely use again!</li>
    <li> It is nice enough. I don&#x27;t flip over it though.</li>
    <li> I must be allergic to something in this fragrance. I had to toss it out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a clean, feel nice fragrance.  I also bought the Oil . I saw it in a gift shop in Florida.  Never thought I could find it so easily.  I just looked it up on Amazon and there it was!!</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing, clean fresh crisp. Very much a fragrance of the sea.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Should last you quite awhile if you use it here and there.</li>
    <li> I like this- it is more spicy than sweet.</li>
    <li> Inis smells like many generic ocean/beach/marine scents on the market. Much like a CK1/Escape hybrid. Clean, marine aquatic that is pleasant, but in my opinion, not worth the raves, especially since the silage and lasting-power are nil. I like the concept, indeed just about everything behind this fragrance, just not sold on the fragrance itself. Imagine a Speedstick antiperspirant note thrown over a spritz of Escape cologne. Meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fragrances of Ireland web store offers samples of all of their fragrances for 2.00 shipping, which is in turn &#x27;reimbursed&#x27; with a 2.00 off coupon; I suggest you try before you buy</li>
    <li> Inis is a beautiful, light, fresh summer scent.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this fragrance but it smells too masculine, too common and too cheap.  I figured it was o nly me that didn&#x27;t like it but I cant give away my bottle.  I am surprised by the amount of people that like this scent. Sticking with my higher end scents.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this perfume. I felt it was too strong and medicinal smelling. I gave it to my friend, I was surprised when she said she wore it.</li>
    <li> I love this crispy clean fragrance this is my third bottle</li>
    <li> I found this delectable treat while traveling in Ireland last fall. Was fearful that would be my one and only bottle. Delighted to discover it is available in the US... and even with shipping was the same price as I paid in Ireland! This is truly a clean and refreshing aroma.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect size for my purse</li>
    <li> wished it was a little less expensive</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for people who don&#x27;t like flowery scents. Perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my. Purse!</li>
    <li> Has a very nice scent.  Light and airy with hints of a deeper undertone.  For the price, it&#x27;s a generous size and I like the simplicity of the bottle.  I gave a 4 because the scent just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> My new favorite fragrance. Fresh and clean scent. Found it at the Irish fest and bought on Amazon for the convience and better price. Seriously... I can find almost anything my heart desires on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This smells very nice - clean, bright.  It&#x27;s not a heavy scent at all.  I have issues with getting headaches if I wear many perfumes but I can tolerate this one well.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful scent - crisp clean citrus in the top notes, some green florals in the middle, and a light woody drydown. I was hesitant about buying it because clove was listed as a base note, and that&#x27;s a scent I really dislike. I asked how predominant the clove was, and two Amazon buyers said it was unnoticeable. They were right, I get a tiny hint of it when the fragrance drys down, but I think that may be because I&#x27;m looking for it. It certainly does not affect the overall fragrance. So my thanks to those buyers for their prompt answers - it would have been a shame to miss out on this fragrance! Highly recommend to anyone who likes clean citrus scents -</li>
    <li> I am the type who loves a light scent. This is a very light scent but oh my goodness is it strong. I do one small squirt holding it a couple of feet away from me and it is still very very strong. Not necessarily a bad thing, you just have to make sure you use it in small doses. It does rub off on other people easily too. I am not kidding about the strength of this perfume. Overall though I love the scent. I usually have issues with most perfumes as the majority of them smell cheap to me. This one doesn&#x27;t smell cheap though. I just got the .5 oz and I was surprised how big it really is. I don&#x27;t think I will ever need another bottle because I like to rotate my fragrances and already have enough to last me a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Just received my Inis and it really was not what I thought it would be.  It kind of reminds of cool waters, smells like grass and water if you can figure that one out.  I am more of a clean soapy or musk kind of girl.  I would say that both men and women could wear this but I think it is more suited for a man.  I really did not care for it but it is my own personal opinion and scent is unique to each person...  Update:  I gave this to a girlfriend of mine and true story she was wearing it one day and I said to her what are you wearing it smells really good and she told me it was the fragrance I gave her.  Well needless to say I was wrong I think has the day wears on this fragrance becomes subtle and fresh.  I re-purchased it...lol.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and bought it. It smells great almost like Ck1 cologne.  It has a fine mist spray but it fades away after a while but still stays on. I would recommend  it.</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne ! I&#x27;m pleased to have found it on Amazon for my husband !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !</li>
    <li> I Love Inis......it arrived promptly, and in good condition. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent and it can be unisex.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Every time I wear it, the scent reminds me of my trip to Ireland.</li>
    <li> Fast and well packaged.I was nervous about ordering a perfume online having never smelled it before but am very happy with the scent.It kind of reminds me of Cool Water Woman.It is one of my new favorites!</li>
