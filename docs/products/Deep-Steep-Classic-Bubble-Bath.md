      <li>The scent is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird reside in the tub like other products.  </li>
      <li>(the C is to clear out the chlorine).</li>

    <li> Had a weird pungent smell, not quite as light as I was expecting a tropical blend to smell. The bubbles didn&#x27;t last very long either. My nephews Elmo bubble bath bubbles last longer.</li>
    <li> Great bubble bath, smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes great bubbles. Kids love to use it at their bath times. Bubbles last for a while also.</li>
    <li> I ordered the lavender and Chamomile and the smell was heaven! A bit disappointed with the actual bubbles, I used half the bottle and still didn&#x27;t get the amount of bubbles I wanted. Still, the smell is strong and even stayed on my skin afterwards, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>

    <li> I bought this for the pure ingredients.  It is bubbly and smells great so it has everything I need in a bubble bath!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  Nice pH Balanced bath product and it doesn&#x27;t have strange/harsh ingredients.  I would recommend it to those looking for smooth and non-abrasive product.</li>
    <li> Love the Passion Fruit Guava smell and lack of chemicals.  My skin feels nice after using.  I definitely recommend this bubble bath.</li>

    <li> My favorite bubble bath!  The scent is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird reside in the tub like other products.  I give this as a gift quite often.</li>
    <li> Very watery. Not particularly bubbly. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> This bubble bath suds well and has a wonderful aroma! I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> When package arrived. Top was broken on bottle.</li>
    <li> Thank you.  Although the top on one of my bottles was damaged through shipping, and I lost some of the soap, but not a lot.  I love the bubble bath,  and compliments any spa bath.</li>
    <li> I love Deep Steep bubble bath, especially the passion fruit and the grapefruit-bergamot scents. I use them for my child, not just as a bubble bath, but also a body wash and shampoo. Just a little goes a long way so the bottle lasts a while. It makes a lot of bubbles and lather. The scent fills the bathroom. I also appreciate the natural and safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but I&#x27;ve been told that it&#x27;s awesome! It has a moisturizing type component to it that helps with skin care and it smells wonderful (that I can attest to as I opened it and smelled it when I received it)!!  Makes quite a bit of bubbles, definitely wouldn&#x27;t use in a jacuzzi or foot bath type thing as it&#x27;d cause quite the mess.</li>
    <li> We love these bubbles, but the guava smell is very sweet and very strong.  We like the bergamot and the lavender better.  As for those that have said there aren&#x27;t enough bubbles just add a 1/4 cup of baking soda and there will be tons of bubbles!  Baking soda is also good for a mild detoxing effect.  And softens the water.  My daughter loves her nightly baths with Deep Steep bubbles, Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes, baking soda and vitamin C (the C is to clear out the chlorine).</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 2 year old toddler and she absolutely loves it!  This brand had the most natural and non toxic ingredients I could find online, so that&#x27;s how I decided to try this brand.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and a good amount of bubble are created .  I would purchase again and try a different scent as well.</li>
    <li> If there was a rating category between good and great it would fit perfectly.  I wish it had more of an aroma than it does but the Passion Fruit Guava is nice.</li>
    <li> The bottle was opened and I lost about 1/4 of it. It was a birthday gift for my mother in law, and thus I was embarrassed to give it to her</li>
    <li> Lots of Bubbles, smells really good. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Fairly large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was that I broke out in a rash all over my body after bathing with these bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;That isn&#x27;t the company&#x27;s fault though, I just have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give this stuff away!</li>
    <li> I even persuaded my hubbie to try this stuff. Love this bubble bath. The real McCoy.&lt;br /&gt;Thick and steepy. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Very pleased and happy with the product</li>
