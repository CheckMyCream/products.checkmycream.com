      <li>i am devastated because i purchased this wand based on the brand name and the good reviews</li>
      <li>Bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday and she loved it.</li>
      <li>i am by no means good at doing hair, in fact before i got this wand</li>
      <li>do this ONCE, and you&#x27;re all good</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loved this curling wand.  </li>
      <li>i loved that it was keratin therapy</li>
      <li>The wand was supposed to be ceramic which usually is a good product</li>
      <li>I purchased this for a gift for my niece who is really good at doing hair....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>oh well i think the price is great :)</li>
      <li>I bought this to see if I would do better, and I am so happy I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was very easy to get used to, and there are some good videos on Youtube if you need a tutorial.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love this curling wand!</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;ve been trying to do a better job of taking care of myself, and this curling wand has helped as part of the effort!  </li>
      <li>Love this wand!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I really loved how easy it is to use it!</li>
      <li>This iron is really great and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It worked amazing.</li>
      <li>There should be some kind of warning about this.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own box.  </li>
      <li>It works very well and gives excellent results.</li>
      <li>I kind of wish I had gotten the 1 inch wand, but I still like the 1.5 inch wand as well.</li>
      <li>but you kind of have to slide it forward to activate it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice curling wand.</li>
      <li>She said that it heated quickly and curled her hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>Great price discount for an original product.</li>
      <li>those who do not like that there is no clip: i find it very easy to use after you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>It did nothing to my hair and my hair curls very easily.  </li>
      <li>(The more you practice, the better you&#x27;ll get!)</li>
      <li>but she ended up returning it for a tapered curling wand which she decided she liked so much more.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>Mermaid hair made easy!</li>
      <li>Personally, I love the beachy soft wave look, and this captures it perfectly.</li>
      <li>, I spent about 5 mins and figured out a good way to use the dial to the best temperature for me.</li>
      <li>Warms up pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t give a very great curl</li>
      <li>The good points are that the wand is lightweight and heats quickly.  </li>
      <li>This would be good for a quick section touch-up.</li>
      <li>my best tip would be, the next time you are at the mall, watch how the girls who are selling those $80 curling wands do it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;m doing this, I could see the Heat light blinking, which confirms the iron is heating up and increasing the temperature setting!</li>
      <li>it works 10x better than a curling iron with a clamp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Works better than any curling wand I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>would not recommend this product, even though the price is great and the reviews seem promising, this product is not.</li>
      <li>I should have done more research.  </li>
      <li>I have this since curling want in the 1 inch and it works wayyyyy better.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Make sure you know how thick you want it! I think I was wanting more of a 1 inch instead, but I still love this. Does great beach waves!</li>
    <li> Love. Perfect for big beachy waves.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. fast shipping. I use this daily on my long hair and its works great.</li>
    <li> This works on 110 volts, but in Europe we use 220 volts. This wasn&#x27;t written anywhere in the listing and I cannot use this item. There should be some kind of warning about this.</li>
    <li> i did not like wearing gloves and trying not to burn myself so i ended up returning it, darn i loved that it was keratin therapy</li>
    <li> It works well if you know how to curl your hair by yourself with no clip to hold you hair in place. That is where I am having trouble.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a curling wand that was bigger than the typical ones I find at stores like Ulta. I have a skinny one and one that looks like a sex toy (you know, with the bumps) but I wanted something that could provide big, loose curls and waves for those days when I want to look perfectly effortless. A tight curl just doesn&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t try today&amp;#34;. I love that this wand is 1.5&amp;#34; and it curls my below shoulder length, fine hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there have been complaints about it not getting hot enough but I prefer to use most tools on a lower heat setting anyway. With fine hair, the curls last longer if I use a lower heat setting. I rarely go above Medium heat. So the lack of hot temps doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What DOES BOTHER ME, is the fact that the temperature dial doesn&#x27;t have any markings on it. The only two settings I can be certain of are the highest and the lowest. There aren&#x27;t temperatures written on the dial. There isn&#x27;t a dot where medium heat would be. The dial doesn&#x27;t even click to let you count how much hotter/cooler you are making the wand. It is just a smooth dial that leaves me guessing where the mid-temp is. I find this to be a very frustrating design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of temperature control/precision, I am going to keep this wand. It makes nice curls that are big and full. It gives my curls a nice, smooth, finished appearance. Overall, I am happy enough with this wand to keep it but if they ever make improvements then they need to focus on the temperature dial first!</li>
    <li> Takes a little bit longer to get the curl because it&#x27;s a wider barrel, but it works well and creates nice polished, casual curls!</li>
    <li> There is no way to view what heat level you are on. There is just a + and - scroll. I have medium length hair and I did my hair this morning with it and the bottom layer looked great. The rest... not so great. And less then 2 hours later it truthfully looked like I hadn&#x27;t even touched it. Now normally my hair does fall a little bit throughout the day but I feel like that&#x27;s normal. I also tried this on my sister who has long hair and it we weren&#x27;t happy with it. She said that she could use her smaller wand and just comb it through to get better looking big curls.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I DO NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love it! But it leaves nasty burn marks. Yikes!</li>
    <li> Do not buy mine heated up so hot that it fried a chunk of my hair off and bent due to being so hot! I do not reccomend at all very unhappy</li>
    <li> Love this wand! Will be buying a few for family / friends. ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. It would NOT curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Juat got mine today. Great buy for the price. I have long thick hair that is almost down to my bum. I sectioned my hair into 6 pieces and held each piece for 15 seconds. It worked amazing. I previously owned a cortex and this works just as great as that! I&#x27;m just hoping it holds out and keeps working for a long time :)</li>
    <li> So I really wanted to love this.  The size is accurate, at just under 1.5&amp;#34;.  But it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my type of hair. Also, I noticed it took a while to heat up so I timed it.  At the lowest setting, it took 1 minute 20 seconds to heat up, and 2 minutes and 30 seconds to heat up to the highest setting of 400 degrees, as evidenced by the blue flashing light that turns solid blue when it reaches the designated heat.  Definitely not what the product description says.  I&#x27;ve attached photos of what my hair looked like over time throughout the day, at first curling, then 2 hours, 4 hours and 9 hours.  I used hairspray.  My other black 1&amp;#34; curling wand (Herstyler) heats up to 450 degrees which clearly makes a difference as I can usually wear my curled hair for a second day in a row!</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it.  So far so good. Only used a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I love this wand though I have noticed some differences. I have a curling wand from the same series but its only and inch and it seems the curls hold much much longer with that one than this one. I really like this one, and maybe its just my hair, but it seems it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to make my curl hold for a long time. Still would recommend to anyone though.</li>
    <li> This wand works well for the price.  The cord is a bit short.  It takes some getting used to though … I burned my neck several times just like back in the 1980s!</li>
    <li> I like this and it was well priced,</li>
    <li> I was soo excited to get this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!... but when I tried to curl my hair , it straightend it instead, and it was smoking like crazy when i wasnt even using it...didn&#x27;t even curl my hair one bit. So thanks to that , I have to go spend $100 now on a decent curling iron...thank you remington.</li>
    <li> I really like it but it doesnt get as hot as my other one and I have stubborn hair so the curls don&#x27;t hold for me :( It&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;ll just have to hold my hair on it longer and use hair spray.</li>
    <li> this product really works. i have been wanting a curling wand for a while now and just got this yesterday. ps im 13. it makes your hair feel reeeaaally silky and strong. it works 10x better than a curling iron with a clamp. i highly reccomend this. i almost bought a sedu curling wand (110$) but this is just the same and in my mind better and cheaper. i have thick long hair that i can completely curl in less that 15 min. get this product</li>
    <li> It would not heat up after two uses. How do I return?</li>
    <li> i bought this item at walmart lol but ive used this wand alot and i loovee it alot some girls have complained about how there curls dont stay in you have to prouduct in your hair thats like expecting your hair to not frizz up when its straight you have to put some serum or something but anyway  its very easy to curl your hair if you know how the glove isnt the best but i never use mine all i was concerned about was the curler the glove just came with it was like a bonus thingy lol my curls stay in it works  great it heats up great too. i say go for it</li>
    <li> Live this curler makes my hair lo</li>
    <li> A tad heavy but otherwise great. Soft, defined curls</li>
    <li> Happy that I really did get this :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually baffled. I have very easy-to-curl hair--it dries curly--and this curling wand could not curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough? It claims to get to 400 degrees, but I know that&#x27;s not true because when it was dialed all the way up and fully heated, I brushed my knuckle against it and did not get burned.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the coating that stops it from curling my hair? I&#x27;m seriously perplexed.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the diameter? It acts like a straightener instead of a curling iron?&lt;br /&gt;Other complaints: there is no indicator to show what temperature you&#x27;re setting it to. She other reviews suggest marking the dial with dots of nail polish, you know there is a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the cord seems very short compared to other curling irons. If your plug is not right next to where you stand at your mirror, you will need an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;(Attached photo shows my hair after attempting to curl it with this Remington 1.5&amp;#34; curling wand, after using styling spray AND hair spray, which I&#x27;ve never had to use with other curling irons.)&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I opened it today and I&#x27;m sending it back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand, it comes with thermal glove. I get big loose curls. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> My hair is short so it&#x27;s not very easy to curl but I am sure it&#x27;s good for long hair to make shiny curl.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday and she loved it. She said that it heated quickly and curled her hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> Does not curl hair what so ever. Gets warm but not hot and curls come over very very very loose.</li>
    <li> Works better than any curling wand I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have long, fine blonde hair. With a little product and good ol&#x27; patience - this thing creates consistent and smooth curls that last all day. (The more you practice, the better you&#x27;ll get!)</li>
    <li> This is the first curling wand that I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have hair that curls really easily, and I got this because I didn&#x27;t want a curling iron with a clamp. It doesn&#x27;t curl well and you can&#x27;t tell what temperature its at.</li>
    <li> i never write reviews but i had to do so today. i received my curling wand a few weeks ago and i have been extremely disappointed. it does not curl properly and was gradually burning my hair even when i use a heat protectant so I will be walking around with a burnt hair smell. this morning, I used the wand on my hair again, as soon as it touched my hair, i heard a fizzle and realized it had fried my hair and the wand itself melted and it was at the lowest heat!.. i am devastated because i purchased this wand based on the brand name and the good reviews but i have been greatly disappointed.. i do not know if i got a defective one but now i cannot return it because the return period has long elapsed.. i cannot even give a half star or no star at all so i will just have to settle for one star</li>
    <li> Great price discount for an original product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and it did not worked. It arrived late but in perfect condition (it looked like it) but never worked. I pluged it and it did nothing. Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Expecting this to work wonders on my daughters long hair but it didn&#x27;t curl well at all. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it. Conair has a better product.</li>
    <li> Love it for my long hair</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this but my curls don&#x27;t hold well like they do with my smaller curling wand and it is hard to finish all of my hair without it getting so hot it burns my hand.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this item because it&#x27;s a hot item to use on your hair for big curls.  My daughter loves the way it curls her hair.  She said that the glove needs to be a bit thicker because she can still feel the heat on her fingers as she curl her hair.  Other than that, she would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good curling iron but definitely meant for thicker hair! If your hair isn&#x27;t that thick then go for a thinner rod of curling iron</li>
    <li> The curls fell out within the first 2 hours. Wasn&#x27;t as hot as I expected it to be. Real bummer</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  Does the job great!  Only con is it initially takes a while to get to your set temp.  But it will stay as hot as you set it throughout the styling process.  My curls are big and bouncy and last all day.</li>
    <li> Used once and it broke wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad buy just saying I got one that didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and fine and hard to curl. This curling wand seems to work pretty well in my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand. I almost returned it due to the temperature dial, but after a quick easy DIY, this babe is a keeper!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the temperature dial IS indeed extremely annoying and confusing at first...&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I spent about 5 mins and figured out a good way to use the dial to the best temperature for me. The dial will eventually stop turning at some point. The key to figuring out when the tool gets hotter is... the BLINKING HEAT LIGHT. This is really easy.&lt;br /&gt;You do this ONCE, and you&#x27;re all good afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. For lowest setting, I turned the dial all the way down til it stops (you push the dial top to bottom). Then when once it stopped turning, i marked the very end of the dial with silver sharpie (or use nail polish). This is the lowest temperature setting, and this way i won&#x27;t forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For highest heat setting, turn it reverse (you rotate the dial bottom to up motion) all the way. As I&#x27;m doing this, I could see the Heat light blinking, which confirms the iron is heating up and increasing the temperature setting! Eventually the light will stop blinking and the surface gets significantly hotter. It&#x27;s at 400 degree. Then mark the dial with different colored sharpie or nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of marking is that you remember which side is at 400degree hot or at lowest heat. So it&#x27;s up to you if you mark it or not. Now, if you were to rotate the dial back to lower setting, the light won&#x27;t blink, since the light blinking is only indication for &#x27;increasing&#x27; temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Lastly, you can kinda tell how many times it takes for you to rotate the dial to each end. For me it takes about 4-5 turns (top to bottom) to reach each end. So I know that if i turn it from either end about 2 times, it&#x27;s about in-between temperature. You can mark these mid points too if you want. Whatever helps you remember. The box says it&#x27;s up to 400 degree high and 30 settings, but I wish they&#x27;d just say what&#x27;s the lowest temperature instead of this useless &#x27;30 settings&#x27;. You can test out your hair on it (test from low to higher) and find which area is your ideal setting. then mark that with different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, this curling wand gives me a very luscious, beautiful natural looking curl compared to regular clip curling iron that used to give me very fake-like curls. Also it only takes 1/3 of the time it used to take me with clip irons. My hair is thick, coarse, non-frizzy, and almost straight Asian hair. Waist-line long. Bleached Ombre.</li>
    <li> This product is not bad, it just wasn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s a 1.5 inch barrel, and I just didn&#x27;t like the way my hair looked when I used it. I have bra strap length hair and the curl wasn&#x27;t smooth, it was more messy. Returned.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work when I got it!  It&#x27;s very disappointing when you buy something and it doesn&#x27;t even turn on!</li>
    <li> styles my hair with those loose curls i was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Not good quality doesn&#x27;t hold the curl for long. Definitely a waste of my money</li>
    <li> I bought this wand for my daughter for Christmas, and she just loves it. She curls her hair every night.</li>
    <li> Love this wand. Makes nice loose curls. Excited to find a wand that gives me what I want!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> cheap and terrible crappy product! TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRODUCT FLIMSY AND DOES NOT WORK. SERIOUSLY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. YIKES</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, it was ok, although the curls didn&#x27;t last for long. Usually my curls last up to 3-4 days but after using this curler, the next day my hair was almost straight. The second time I used it, it burned my hair, literally. After wrapping a strand of hair on it, right away I saw smoke and I couldn&#x27;t unwrap my hair, it was just stuck on the thing and turned black. You can actually see in the picture a darker stripe, where my hair got turned into ash. I guess it overheated itself or the product was faulty. So disappointed. I intend to return it, as it stopped working after that and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Not that I would have the courrage to try it again...</li>
    <li> Mermaid hair made easy!</li>
    <li> Curls great! I accidentally burned my arm and it left a huge nasty mark- be careful!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to secure and hold a curl like other wands do. I can usually use this size barrel with a regular curling iron and it hold better than what this produces. Kinda disappointed since most wands get hot enough to hold your curl for days, this one barely holds at all.</li>
    <li> Even though this gets incredibly hot, my hair will not hold a curl using this wand. No matter what products I try, they fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used cheap curling irons and my curls last all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if it&#x27;s because the wand creates curls larger than my natural ones....</li>
    <li> Love this curler and the temperature adjuster</li>
    <li> Love this product. Super easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something that creates great relaxed beach waves. Previously had the conair wand I think , one with the red handle, and wanted something that makes bigger waves . This is perfect ! Just takes a longer time , depending how big of chunks you do at a time and how hot the setting is . I put mine almost all the way up to the highest and works the best. Love this! I have decently thick long hair and works just fine for me!</li>
    <li> So disappointed. My hair curls great normally, but it couldn&#x27;t hold a curl for 5 minutes with this iron.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but my hair is hard to curl</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t work. I gave it away and it didn&#x27;t work for my friend either. It gets hot but when I twril my hair around the barrel nothing happens :(</li>
    <li> I am a pretty low-maintenance kind of girl - I wash my hair at night, let it air dry, and usually stick it in a ponytail in the morning for the day.  No product, and just a bit of eyeliner.  But, I&#x27;ve been trying to do a better job of taking care of myself, and this curling wand has helped as part of the effort!  Even for someone like me who&#x27;s beauty-impaired quickly got the hang of this thing after watching a few youtube videos :-)  The stay-cool tip is huge, as I can attest from my friends who have other wands and burn themselves almost regularly!  I have coarse, wavy-straight hair that has dulled a bit with age, and this wand definitely adds shine and makes me look like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon!  All I use is a bit of thermal hair spray, add some curls and voila!  I chose this wand based on the reviews, and they are spot on - this is a great product and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. My hair is medium thickness and it&#x27;s length is to my waist. I also use a spray gel when my hair wet to give it more texture. It does take time and practice to ge used to the wand.</li>
    <li> Was really disappointed in this product, it does not heat up. The only button it has is to turn it on. Then when the light stops blinking its supposed to be set to maximum temperature but it doesn&#x27;t show you at what temperature it is or how high you can set it. Got it a couple months ago, tried it on my hair 4 - 5times, till I just gave up on it. It&#x27;s been sitting in my closet ever since ......</li>
    <li> This clipless curling iron is perfect for waving and styling your hair. It works very well and gives excellent results. Needless to say, I am very happy with it and recommend it to everyone. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I hate spending hours trying to do curls especially when I can&#x27;t do them right, this is definitely for women like me who don&#x27;t know much about hair and are always on the go!</li>
    <li> I have 2c/3a curly hair, pretty dry and frizzy. Straightening it takes almost an hour only because it&#x27;s very long. With this wand, it takes me 35 mins for big soft curls. I have pretty tight natural curls already so I didn&#x27;t want the 1 inch wand (or a tapered wand), and got this one instead and it&#x27;s perfect for big loose curls. Since my hair is long and heavy by the end of the day they have slightly fallen out, into more waves (I don&#x27;t use hairspray at all, so maybe that&#x27;s why), but I think it still looks good. So glad I decided to get it, if you&#x27;re unsure about it, definitely get it, watch some videos on youtube about how to get different styles, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after trying my sister&#x27;s 1 1/2 inch Chi curling wand. I really like it! The curls definitely don&#x27;t last as long as that one did, but for the price it&#x27;s awesome. This will only create loose curls though since the barrel is a bit bigger; if you&#x27;re wanting tighter curls, definitely go with a 1 inch instead!</li>
    <li> I have had a,dreadful.experience with.this product. On first use it overheated and completely melted away an.entire section of my.daughters hair. I have complained to the company and have heard nothing more than.an acknowledgement back</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great curling iron it really worked on my hair and I have short hair. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but the glove that was supposed to come with it, wasn&#x27;t included.</li>
    <li> Provides the exact curls I wanted! Not to small, not to big</li>
    <li> Wand does not get hot enough to curl my human hair extensions. Also, barrell (the cool gray part where you place your hands) is too bulky and wide for my small hands. Returned. Purchased the remington pink digital ceramic curling wand and love it!</li>
    <li> this is the perfect curling iron! it worked great the first few months however the black tip on the end is now heating up very very hot- it didnt use to :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift for my niece who is really good at doing hair....she loves it.  Works great and no complaints.</li>
    <li> I really liked this wand when I first bought it, but the more I use it the more I don&#x27;t like it. The heat settings aren&#x27;t quite where I need them to be for my hair (medium-long length, finer, wavy). I also find it incredibly annoying that it shuts off after 20 minutes by itself. Wish I could turn that part off!</li>
    <li> I own and love the Remington Tstudio Pearl wand at the 0.5&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; size, and was looking for a larger wand since my hair is so long. I expected that also being Remington, this wand would work as well as -if not better than- that wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on the hottest setting, taking a small amount of hair, using product, and holding for an extended period of time, it wont create a substantial curl. I spent an hour with this wand, using mousse and hairspray, and immediately afterwards, only the ends of my hair were slightly curled.</li>
    <li> Hair slipped out everytime I tried using it.  It was too big/bulky.  Temperature dial doesn&#x27;t have numbers so you have to guess where you think might be the right temperature for you.</li>
    <li> I have to hold my hair for a long time for it to curl. My hair curls faster on other surfaces used for the barrel. Not this one though. Wish I could return. But it works. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I attempted to curl my hair using this wand multiple times throughout a week.  I tried clean, just washed hair.  Hair after not washing.  Tried different products (mouse, hairspray, combination of the two).  My hair never took a curl.  Not even a wave.  I also varied the temperature.  I ended up calling Remington for help and they sent me a prepaid label to ship the product back to them.  Even thought the item was purchased on Amazon, they sent me a refund check.&lt;br /&gt;Another gripe:  the temperature control knob has no markings, so you never know what temperature setting you are on.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not work for me so I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> This curler does not get hot enough to create any sort of lasting curl.  I had this on next to my other wand and you could feel the difference, both on high, this was no where near 400 degrees.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair that does not hold curl well. This curling iron gives me loose, bouncy waves that look awesome! Another plus is that it&#x27;s way lighter in weight than my other Conair curling wand, which makes the process easier.</li>
    <li> I pride myself on my ability to curl hair. Likewise, my hair curls extremely easy; Nevertheless, this curling iron produced minimal curls. If you want victoria secret &amp;#34;did she just curl her hair or no?&amp;#34; hair then go for this curler. But it is such a waste of money becuase the curls produced by this product can easily be created by a straightening iron. Dont waste your money! Buy a smaller barrell and you&#x27;ll be 10x happier. I also tried to return it and was notified that I would have to pay the same exact money I paid for the iron to just send it back! Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> DOESNT CURL MY HAIR AT ALL...TRY THE SAME BRAND BUT THE PINK WAND</li>
    <li> i know this curling wand is for professional, but is not easy to use, think well before u get it</li>
    <li> I have straight hair so my hair is resistant to hold curls all day, but with enough hairspray and in small enough sections this curling iron will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the glove is horrible!</li>
    <li> Heats up quick.&lt;br /&gt;Great for big loose curls and smooths hair while curling for less frizz.</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
    <li> This curling iron did not even come in it&#x27;s own box.  It came loose with the glove and instructions only.  Gross!  Didn&#x27;t even turn on once, it just flat out never worked.  Sending it back and will not order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I have to say I am displeased with it because it would curl my hair and when I put hairspray on it the curls fell out within and hour of curling my hair. Even though I put lots of hairspray on my hair. I also used it to curl a friends hair and it did the same to her hair. I do have to say that i regret buying this product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was gonna like this item. I hate it. Did not hold my curls like it said it would. DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This curling wand doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair it did curl my hair but my hair didn&#x27;t keep the curl for longer then about 15 minutes. Keep in mind my hair is hard to curl and takes a lot to keep a curl. My other curling wand curls my hair great and my hair will hold that curl until my  next wash.. I just had wanted a bigger wand. But, I guess this is not the wand for me. I hope others have better luck then I did with this.</li>
    <li> Everything went fine, the product arrived when it was supposed to, but the curling wand didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my hair or the wand but the curls won&#x27;t stay for long, they last like 30 min. And if you set the temperature to the highest it will make your hair smell like burned fabric or something so that&#x27;s a big deal. Oh it has a screw on the  end of the barrel and sometimes the hair gets stuck in it so that&#x27;s another con. I would give it a 3 out of 10  to this product</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, but a lot of it. The ONLY way to make my hair even remotely wavy with this curling wand is to use TEENY TINY sections of hair, which would take forever, or to hold my hair on the wand for an extended period of time. Quite simply, this curling wand does not get hot enough! I&#x27;ve tried product/hairspray vs no product vs clean hair vs day-old hair and the performance still leaves a lot to be desired. I have the same version of this curling wand in 1 inch and it works a million times better than this version. Disappointed in the inconsistency between products. Will return ASAP.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to jump on the curling wand band wagon for a while. Being a cosmetologist I just use all my others irons. Finally decided on this one since it was cheap, figured I&#x27;d take a shot.  I am pleasantly surprised! I have coarse hair and usually have to flat iron or curl at about 450*.  This I believe goes to about 400 but still works really well.  my hair falls about 6&amp;#34; below my shoulders and the curls are large and loose using the 1.5&amp;#34; barrel. If your hair is any shorter than that I would go with a 1&amp;#34; for sure because you wont have enough to wrap around the wand - at least to get a nice curl.&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to get used to, and there are some good videos on Youtube if you need a tutorial. Just copy the name/size and search that on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;This is a 100% win for me, i&#x27;ve used it a lot and plan on continuing to!!!</li>
    <li> It broke within 2 uses. Perhaps not compatible for UK use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t curl my hair frequently, and that is largely because I always hated the dents a clip iron would leave in my hair and didn&#x27;t like trying to work my hair through a clip iron while avoiding the hot clip and trying to keep it from shutting all the way at the same time....it was a bit too much like juggling. Because of this, I thought I would take to this clip-less iron like a duck to water, but there is still a learning curve...apparently even a cumulative life total of 120 minutes with a clip iron is enough to train your brain about styling. However, I think the relearning process would probably be easier with a slightly smaller barrel, but I need one this big to do the loose waves I want as easily as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove that comes with this iron is very basic/loose which makes it easy to use on both hands, so no worries there lefties. However, this is also one of the irons downfalls. Since the glove is protective, the loose fit of it makes the process of using this a bit clumsier since you aren&#x27;t able to zero in on detail as well as you can with bare hands or a snug glove. I imagine that after one gets really, really comfortable with this unit that you may be able to go gloveless without burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this iron is that the on switch is insane. It is actually a push button but you kind of have to slide it forward to activate it. It usually takes me a couple of tries to get the proper measure of down and slightly forward because it isn&#x27;t a rocker switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this does a great job with my hair after we get rolling. I also like to use it on days when my hair is frizzy from the humidity. I just gently roll my hair over really loosely to avoid a dedicated wave or curl, but still get the taming benefits. It would be really difficult to do this with a clip iron and I don&#x27;t care for flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a four because of the peculiar switch and the awkwardness of the glove, but after  youget past that it is a good iron.</li>
    <li> I should probably start by saying that this is the first review that I have done on Amazon...that might tell you how disappointed I was in this product. I have only bought one curling wand prior to this so I can&#x27;t say I have much experience. However, this curling wand did not curl at all and I had it on the highest heat setting. The curling wand that I currently have (pink pearl ceramic model) is also a remington so I thought I was safe with choosing this one. I have curls for days when I use my current wand and that is saying a lot since I have very difficult to curl hair. I held my hair on this for much longer (30 seconds versuse 10 with the other) and barely got one curl out of it and I have mid back length hair. I&#x27;ll be returning it tomorrow. Check out the pink pearl ceramic model if you don&#x27;t mind a taper. I was looking for a straight curling wand.</li>
    <li> Amazing curling iron especially for this price!</li>
    <li> A better name for this \\&quot;Curling Wand\\&quot; would be the \\&quot;WAVE Wand.\\&quot;  This product does not give curls, instead it smooths, adds body and slight waves.  In addition, this wand is NOT for people with shorter hair.  I have mid-back length hair and I think anything much shorter would not work with this wand.  I do have to admit that I&#x27;m more of a hot rollers person because I can put the rollers in and multi-task.  I did find there was a learning curve with trying to section my hair and wrap it around the wand.  I definitely will not be using it on a daily basis for that reason.  This would be good for a quick section touch-up.</li>
    <li> I like that Keratin-infused Ceramic barrel for less hair damage and even heat distribution and that it is clipless. My issues with this product is the lack of knowing which heat setting you are on since it is not numbered, you have to count every click to try to figure it out. I have fine, long hair and this curling wand hardly curled my hair. I had to go over it a couple times just to get a slight wave to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself is very hot and stays hot for a long time. This does not compare to my Cortex Pro curling wand for the same price but works much better and holds the curl for a couple of days. The glove included is ridiculous, I did not receive a thermal glove as pictured but a standard cotton one which was too large and the fingertips would rubbed up against the hot barrel since I was trying to get my ends as close to the barrel as possible so I wouldn&#x27;t have an awkward straight edge. Overall, not very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I just need a little practice,  but this is exactly that I was looking for my hair...works perfect for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on behalf of my wife.  She has fine, naturally-blonde hair at shoulder length.  She curls and styles it every day for work, so she knows a thing or two about curling wands.  In her closet at this very moment there are five curling irons and one set of curlers, and she has owned even more in the past.  She wanted to like this product, and she tried to be positive when telling me about it, but she admitted in the end that it&#x27;s worst curling iron she owns.  The following are her comments about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The curls don&#x27;t last.  Her curls began to fall out within 30 minutes without product, whereas she can go about six hours after using one of her better irons in the same way.  Even with hair spray, this Remington curling wand did a very poor job, she says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s impossible to get a tight curl - what you get is more of a body wave.  Maybe this could be expected from an iron so wide in diameter, but if you&#x27;re looking for a tight curl, this wand is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* She did praise the iron for warming up really fast, but she says that its top temperature is not very hot.  The product allegedly has 30 heat settings, but it&#x27;s really just a dial.  My wife claims that the very highest setting is not even close to the temperature she gets from her Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Finally, she says the glove is a nice touch but it&#x27;s so bulky it&#x27;s practically useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, you get what you pay for.  My wife admitted that it&#x27;s a decent deal for $30, but anyone who curls their hair very often will definitely want to splurge for a better product.</li>
    <li> The curling wand itself is great. The heat protection glove that comes with it is not great for isolation tough.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  But I really really HATE it.  I&#x27;ve wanted a 1 ½ inch curling iron for a while.  But I couldn&#x27;t get this to work for me AT ALL.  My hair is very fine, past my shoulders, and extremely easy to curl – and I&#x27;m also pretty handy with hair tools, too.  However, there was NO WAY I could get my hair to stay wrapped around the barrel no matter what I did or how I held it with the glove.  And instead of a loose curl, which is what I wanted, all I got was a few strangely weird bends in my hair.  And even those – thankfully I guess – dropped out in just a few minutes.  Also, the claim of &amp;#34;30 heat settings for precise styling control&amp;#34; is a joke.  The heat settings are on an UNNUMBERED free-spinning wheel on the barrel.  I have NO IDEA what number I was on – and I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to get back to it anyway even if I tried.  So, I just used the highest setting and the &amp;#34;weird bends&amp;#34; still fell out right away.  Glad it works for some people.  But I&#x27;m sending back!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY.  It did nothing to my hair and my hair curls very easily.  My hair smelled BURNT the rest of the day.  So I thought it might have just been my hair. -Medium length.  So I gave it to my best friend to try, her hair is very long and also holds curl fairly well.  It also did nothing to her hair and left her hair smelling burnt.&lt;br /&gt;However, the seller did ship very quickly and it arrived on time. I would return this but it is too much hassle.  In the garbage it went.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. I used this hair wand everyday. I spent a good month burning my fingers but after I got used to using it and developed some thick scars, I&#x27;m now a pro. This wand gets hot quickly and has an auto-off feature to keep you from burning down your house when you forget to turn it off.</li>
    <li> Wanted a big curling wand.  I should have done more research.  This wand does not hold a curl even with products. :/</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this wand does not curl enough. Curls are too lose. I will need to try another type.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product was a disappointment. I have pretty thin, easy to manage hair and this wand didn&#x27;t work at all on my hair. The product says that you can heat it up to 400 degrees, but that&#x27;s not accurate at all. I could hold the curler on my hair for literally 1 minute and there was nothing! I know it&#x27;s not the straightness of my hair because I bought a new wand by Bed Head and I hold it on my hair for 3 seconds, maybe 5, and there is a fully intact curl from it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, even though the price is great and the reviews seem promising, this product is not.</li>
    <li> terrible ,it doesnt curl at all</li>
    <li> I really liked this device leaves me very beautiful and durable curls very proto temperature rises, but leaves curls shiny if you do not put some extra shine. but usually very good unit for big curls and carefree.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected but since it&#x27;s a gift I don&#x27;t know how well she&#x27;ll like it. I hope she does.</li>
    <li> The wand was supposed to be ceramic which usually is a good product but it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give your hair a hard time.</li>
    <li> The best mid sized curling iron for loose wavy curls.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good 1.5 in curling wand for a long time to create a specific style and this fits the bill! While I find the heatproof glove awkward to use, it does what it&#x27;s designed to do, I just go without it and risk burning my fingers. My hair does NOT like to hold a curl, but so far my curls have lasted all day and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from total strangers. Oh, and the best part of the curling wand is that the power button and heat controls are recessed into the handle so I don&#x27;t keep turning it off mid curl! I definitely recommend this curling wand!</li>
    <li> Love it gives my hair a nice wavy curl and looks natural!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it as it had a US plug and even though I bought online a US to UK converter, when I tried to use it it got burnt. Very disappointed with the product :(</li>
    <li> Just got this baby. Got the 1 1/2 inch barrel for longer hair/bigger waves. I don&#x27;t imagine this size would be effective if you don&#x27;t have at least shoulder length hair. It takes a bit of practice to get used to. Start with dry clean hair. Section off your hair and take a small section (1 inch or so, depending on your hair type) and wrap it around the barrel. Hold for about 10 seconds (Depends on your hair type. Don&#x27;t hold it for too long or you will burn your hair!). Repeat in 1 inch sections until you see your finished dream hair! I set mine with light hair spray. Would be great if it came with two gloves (I use either hand depending on which side I am working on). I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars for the price because it gets the job done! This product does not have a temperature reading, so if you want that you&#x27;ll have to go for another model.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> i am a beginner  with this type of products. I really loved how easy it is to use it! I love how it leaves my hair my only complaint is that i have no idea how to set the heat.. the little wheal doesn&#x27;t give you degrees or anything..  but oh well i think the price is great :)</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t curl my hair as good as I thought it would at all :( but it I&#x27;d ship fast</li>
    <li> This curling wand is really great! The heat that it has really locked the curls and the barrel size is really great. Right now I have a shorter angle bob so it&#x27;s a little hard to get the back pieces of my hair... ( I probably should have bought a smaller barrel for the back). However, once my hair grows out again it should be easier. The wave it creates is a very loose waves and gives volume at the top if you are following the directions. I YouTubed some pointers which was very helpful. Best tip of all.... USE THE HEAT GLOVE UNTIL YOUR READY. It will save you from some serious burns!</li>
    <li> Can burn hand because the black end is too short for your fingers to help hold it.</li>
    <li> I received this product THREE times. Each time it came in the mail I immediately plugged it into my bathroom outlet and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I attempted to troubleshoot, plugging it into multiple outlets, even going as far as taking it to my office to see if it would work- all to no avail. I continued to return the product to the shipper and receive a refund. This happened THREE times. This is an absolutely terrible product.</li>
    <li> Great size but does not reach the needed temperature</li>
    <li> I just got this curling iron today and was playing around with it and it&#x27;s perfect! The barrel size is perfect and I just love it! The only downside is that you can&#x27;t really see how hot it is because it&#x27;s just a dial thing but doesn&#x27;t show the temp. Other that that I love it! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t put a curl in my hair, just a slight wave</li>
    <li> This item wasn&#x27;t very good quality... It didn&#x27;t heat up enough to be able to curly my hair well. I was disapointed</li>
    <li> like curling wand alot though for tighter curl should have purchased maller size other wise very good i use heat glove as it is possible to burn your knuckles or fingers if not familiar with using curling wand curls are more like waves...wont last long in humidity but does make a cute hair style if used with light holding spray.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife who wanted to curl her hair. While the iron got very hot and seemed to curl the hair nicely, the barrel is just too large for curls. Her hair ended up with loose waves instead of distinguishable curls. For a true curling iron, I&#x27;d have to recommend a smaller iron.</li>
    <li> The waves this curling iron makes are very large and would be very hard to use on someone whom has short hair. The waves stay in my hair for about 6 hours - i don&#x27;t use any product to hold the waves. Using a spray would definitely keep them in longer. It only takes me about 10 minutes to do all of my hair, i have quite a bit of hair too(24\\&quot;). Its a nice way to change up boring straight hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to those who do not like that there is no clip: i find it very easy to use after you get the hang of it. my best tip would be, the next time you are at the mall, watch how the girls who are selling those $80 curling wands do it. i always glance at them when i see them and they have a very specific technique they use with clip-less curling wands. watch a couple you tube videos. you have to get a lock of hair, make it flat, then as you wrap it around the wand, keep it flat to make as much hair as possible have contact with the wand. you cannot just wad all your hair over the same spot and expect it to heat your hair enough to create curls. there IS technique involved and watching someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing makes all the difference. i am by no means good at doing hair, in fact before i got this wand i hadn&#x27;t curled my hair in years! now i love curling it, and the only reason i knew how was by watching the girls at the mall.</li>
    <li> Great wand. Works well. Perfect size for long hair.</li>
    <li> This curling wand heats up very quickly and works efficiently.  The wand produces large soft curls which is nice for longer hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this curler because I wanted a bigger barrel that I could wrap My hair around. My hair is really long, almost to my belt. I was able to wrap the entire length of my hair around it, but even with hair spray and the highest temperature setting, the waves fell out really quickly. I was careful to use small sections, but it just didn&#x27;t stay on my hair, it went flat very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did like about this curler is that it does leave your hair really shiny.</li>
    <li> The good points are that the wand is lightweight and heats quickly.  The keratin infused barrel smoothed my hair.  I would not recommend this tool to anyone.  I had difficulty turning it on.  The on/off switch is awkward and difficult to use. It was hard to hold the wand on my hair even using the heat resistant glove.  The users manual was of little help to me.  I will not use it again. Review written by my wife Merna.</li>
    <li> I really like this wand. It gives me big natural looking curls. I am not a huge fan of having curly hair just because it doesn&#x27;t fit my face frame and plus I don&#x27;t like spending more than 30 min on my hair. So this wand gives me quick natural  looking curls and does not take that much amount of time which is awesome. This wand curler is my best friend for my nights out with the girls.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying a curling iron online without seeing it in person first. However, this curling wand exceeded my expectations. It curls my hair well and also decreases the frizziness of my hair at the same time. I kind of wish I had gotten the 1 inch wand, but I still like the 1.5 inch wand as well. It doesn&#x27;t leave any crimps in the hair because there is no clamp which is perfect for stylish waves.</li>
    <li> [My wife tried this one] This curling iron comes with a glove for safety, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, if you want tight curls, this one doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.  Great for looser curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it does produce a \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feel in your hair.</li>
    <li> Warms up pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t give a very great curl</li>
    <li> My wife has used this curler and this is what she has to say about it! This may be a great hair curler for someone who has the time and patience to learn how to use it correctly, but for me it&#x27;s just so much easier to use a regular curler. Since there&#x27;s no tongue to grab onto your hair, this curler comes with a glove you wear on one hand. You are supposed to hold your hair against the curler, and the glove protects your hand from burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be too much of an ordeal. First of all, you have to keep the glove and curler together. Then you have to figure out how to position your gloved hand in order to hold the hair in place, which becomes especially difficult with the hair behind your head! I kept dropping the hair, and then I&#x27;d have to reposition everything again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler took about 3-4 minutes to warm up to full heat. I had to turn it down a bit because on the highest setting, the curler was too way too hot to touch even with the glove on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a stylist doing this for me, I&#x27;m sure this curler would be an improvement over the regular kind since you don&#x27;t end up with a crimp where the curler grabbed your hair. But for one person, it&#x27;s very tricky.</li>
    <li> I have this since curling want in the 1 inch and it works wayyyyy better. I find that this one doesn&#x27;t curl my hair. It leaves it in a very very loose wave. I was pretty disappointed. Ship time was decent though</li>
    <li> It works very well and is much more gentle with my hair than my flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to get fat curls. I have long hair and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Best wand I&#x27;ve seen for the price! It really works well and gives you large curls!</li>
    <li> This is a nice curling wand. Heats well but doesn&#x27;t seem to curl that great on my daughters very long hair.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and then some!!!</li>
    <li> I love it make my hair so beautiful!</li>
    <li> This wand heats up really fast and works really good if you want those super wavy curls. I love it</li>
    <li> The heat selection is not easy to use, it&#x27;s just a simple thumb up and thumb down. The first time I used it, it must have been not hot enough because the curls were not that great. Next time I put the heat up and boy, I smelled hair burning!! Luckily, didn&#x27;t burn off but it smelled.  So there IS a happy medium which I believe I finally discovered by lowering it a tad more. It&#x27;s not easy holding the hair on it even with the glove provided, My hair slides off. Takes much practice and patience. I have pretty long hair, too. Someone with shoulder length hair will no doubt be frustrated. My long hair has a hard enough time staying on the barrel. It does big, beachy loose waves. You aren&#x27;t going to get a really defined curl with this. Just barely a loose wave. Which is OK if that is the look you are after. Tip:  When you put your hair around it, don&#x27;t just wrap your hair around and around fast; you need to put the hair flat on the barrel, then go around and put the next part of your hair flat (not on top of or encroaching on the the previous section). The more careful you wrap the hair flat onto the barrel, the better the curl comes out.</li>
    <li> This iron is really great and easy to use.  The barrel is large enough where I don&#x27;t have really tight curls, instead lose wavy onces.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have a curling wand that I&#x27;ve been using for six years now, and have really appreciated the effect it gives. It&#x27;s still working, but it wasn&#x27;t as thick as the Remmington, and got narrower as it got closer to the end of the wand. I bought this to see if I would do better, and I am so happy I did. I love the thickness- it doesn&#x27;t give a curl per se, it&#x27;s more of a light wave and bounce-- sort of like what you&#x27;d expect from rollers. In less than ten minutes, with this I&#x27;m achieving that blow dry bar look, which is great for my very straight and limp hair. I&#x27;m thrilled that I can do so much in such little time-- in the past, to get a look I don&#x27;t like as much, it&#x27;s taken me closer to 30-35 minutes. If you&#x27;re looking for more of a tight curl, I&#x27;m not sure this is the one for you- although I&#x27;m sure you could get a little more than a wave if you wrap your hair tighter and closer. Personally, I love the beachy soft wave look, and this captures it perfectly. So happy I got this.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. The size lets me get the curls I need for the amount of hair I have. I have very thick hair that goes past my chest. I like that the barrel doesn&#x27;t become slender like most wands and I have even large curls.</li>
    <li> This wand wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. It was hard for me to curl my hair, I had to hold it for probably a minute for it to create one single curl. And, the curls didn&#x27;t even last for more than 3 hours. I regret buying this</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try the wand type curling iron but didn&#x27;t want to buy a really expensive. It did it&#x27;s job of convincing me that I like the wand style curling, but now I wish I had bought a higher end quality. It does the trick but I&#x27;m confident my curls would last longer if I had a nicer one.</li>
    <li> this is for people with LONG hair. I curled my hair in under 5 minutes and since I use heat damage on my hair almost every day. My curls stayed in.</li>
    <li> This is a fine curling wand. I have long hair, and I had previously bought a 3/4 inch barrel much more expensive brand. It made tighter curls. The reviewers who are saying they have a \\&quot;bob\\&quot; or 6-inch long hair, why are you buying such a big barrel?? No need to give a bad review for that. This heats up well and gives big loose curls for girls with longer hair which is what I wanted. Definitely does the job for the price. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Terrible. It doesn&#x27;t even curl your hair.</li>
    <li> This curling wand works great for longer hair - and gives big wavy relaxed curls.  Other reviewers who gave this poor ratings seemed to be more confused by how to use curling wands in general. If you never used a wand, you have to get used to it (vs a standard curling iron). But this product does exactly what it is supposed to do. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the YouCurl wand (Conair) for over a year, and have loved it! Now my hair has gotten longer and so the diameter of my YouCurl created much tighter curls than I like, so I was simply trying to buy a similar product but of wider diameter. I should&#x27;ve just bought the same brand and model but a larger size, but I decided to try this one due to all the &amp;#34;Keratin&amp;#34; hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the unit I got was defective, or if adding Keratin (if that&#x27;s actually true and not just marketing nonsense) prevents this from having any impact, or if this is just a terrible product, but it really did absolutely nothing to my hair, not even a slight wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that I have mediterranean hair, so it curls pretty easily, and the old wand I had created the tightest curls for me, and they lasted for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just returned it and bought another larger sized Conair model, lets hope that one works as well as the original!</li>
    <li> I wanted a curling wand that would give a big bouncy curl. This product came quickly and had a nice appeal. I thought it would be great when I turned it on and it heated up fairly quick. I was sadly mistaken!!! This product is awful. I have shoulder length straight hair that is cut into layers. When I used the product it did absolutely nothing for my hair. It gave me a very very loose wave that I brushed out. I would recommend getting a different curling wand if you want it to actually curl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I regret getting a large curler though, because the curls won&#x27;t stay long enough and it&#x27;s more for wavy hair than to create long lasting curls</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair this probably isn&#x27;t the curling wand for you. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get a good spiral no matter how thin the section. If you have thin or fine hair it&#x27;s probably just what you&#x27;re looking for. Good looking product, very well made. I&#x27;m pretty bummed that it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This is great! I was looking for a wand that wouldd give me like big natural waves instead of curls and this does the job!</li>
    <li> I like that it will light up solid when it is finish heating so you dont have to try and guess when it is hot enough or touch it to see.</li>
    <li> the barrel is pink and left some pink stain on my hair.  each piece that i curled had a bit of pink that didnt come out until i showered</li>
    <li> I had to buy a new curling iron because my trusty old one shorted out. It went pffsfsfpfttttt, sparked and sent a puff of black smoke out that turned my hand black (don&#x27;t worry, it washed off!). It was tired I guess!&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this Remington C15338.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure my disappointment is with my ability, not the product. I have long very thick, slightly wavy hair. Even though I think I got the knack of using this type of curling &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34;, I have to use very small sections of hair and hold each one for a loooong time to get any curl. It took me FOREVER to do my whole head and I still had only a slight wave.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my daughter, I&#x27;ll be looking for a good old school &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; curling iron :-)</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved this curling wand.  It worked really well and heated thoroughly but she ended up returning it for a tapered curling wand which she decided she liked so much more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand to replace mine that was smaller and did not provide the results I wanted. I have very think hair and this product works on it swimmingly. It creates really nice large curls which can be styled to be loose waves as well. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to receive this product.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it in did not have an Australian power cord which was not indicated.&lt;br /&gt;Found it difficult to plug into universal socket.&lt;br /&gt;When I did the first time i used it on a low setting it tripped out burning my hair as well as the appliance itself.&lt;br /&gt;Must have been faulty&lt;br /&gt;A VERY BAD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Perfect curling wand to make the perfect beach waves! I have very long, thick, super straight hair. The optimum temperature of this wand works wonders with actually curling my hair. I would definitely recommend this to someone with the same type of hair I have!</li>
    <li> No curl&lt;br /&gt;By Amazon Customer - July 29, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to curl my hair using this wand multiple times throughout a week. I tried clean, just washed hair. Hair after not washing. Tried different products (mouse, hairspray, combination of the two). My hair never took a curl. Not even a wave. I also varied the temperature. I ended up calling Remington for help and they said that they would send Me a more detailed information paper which I never received.&lt;br /&gt;Another gripe: the temperature control knob has no markings, so you never know what temperature setting you are on.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not work for me so I cannot recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it one star is BC if I Didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t be able to post it</li>
    <li> My hair is past my shoulders and I love the look of the clip less irons but the 1 1/4 in looks best after its fallen a bit so I thought that if I got a 1.5 in that I could get that look right away. It is true but the curl loosens and becomes more straight. I do like this iron and the end look. I wish it got hotter.</li>
    <li> For fine hair, this wand did not work. I have long fine hair and I didn&#x27;t look like I had any curl at all.</li>
    <li> Biggest waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t do crap to my hair, just makes it hot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably just me.  I am simply not patient enough for this curling wand.  I have two now, and I have the same problem with both.  I can do one side of my head okay, but the other ... no.  Not for me.  But the product was fine.  The quality is there.  It&#x27;s me, no doubt.</li>
</ol>
