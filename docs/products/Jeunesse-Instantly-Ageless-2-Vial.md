      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Very pleased!</li>
      <li>I purchased this for mom and it is great.</li>
      <li>Great on reducing under eye puffiness.</li>
      <li>Stuff is great if you aren&#x27;t planning on putting make up on over it.  </li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>After waiting a good 30-40 minutes to see if I would have any noticeable difference, I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and washed it off.</li>
      <li>good for a photo shoot, but not an event.</li>
      <li>Will order more!</li>
      <li>great price for someone wanting to try this before buying a large quantity.</li>
      <li>Works like magic</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m still working on just the right amount of usage.</li>
      <li>It did come right away with no problems but that is all I can say for the experience...</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I need to not use too much of it</li>
      <li>But if you dab it on lightly and leave it alone it will last for about 4 hours with no issues.</li>
      <li>If you put too much on it will flake off.  </li>
      <li>worked well for my husband&#x27;s bags under his eyes for a little while, did nothing for me and my fine lines.it wore off of him very quickly when he just moved or touched it after it dried.</li>

    <li> I purchased the vials but rec  packets instead I did not see a big difference with product</li>
    <li> Worked great! Very pleased! Will order more!</li>
    <li> Great stuff ! Works like magic</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Took before and after photos, no difference in appearance noted.  I did however notice that my skin felt like someone had poured Elmer&#x27;s glue on it and then let it dry...it was a very uncomfortable feeling.  After waiting a good 30-40 minutes to see if I would have any noticeable difference, I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and washed it off.</li>
    <li> I like it! Makes me look, thus feel younger.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Worked as well as advertised.</li>
    <li> worked well for my husband&#x27;s bags under his eyes for a little while, did nothing for me and my fine lines.it wore off of him very quickly when he just moved or touched it after it dried. good for a photo shoot, but not an event.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate anything but this was a joke.  I saw absolutely no improvement when I used it.</li>
    <li> Gee Whiz!!!  This product works!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the cream are all don&#x27;t see the diference and just make me an eye burn not recommended</li>
    <li> Stuff is great if you aren&#x27;t planning on putting make up on over it.  If you put too much on it will flake off.  But if you dab it on lightly and leave it alone it will last for about 4 hours with no issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a couple times...it helps, but when it dries it leaves a whitish flaky film</li>
    <li> Great on reducing under eye puffiness. Love it.</li>
    <li> Felt like I had Elmer&#x27;s glue on my face. I noticed no difference except that. It is not worth the expensive cost... I only gave it 1 star because I had to. It did come right away with no problems but that is all I can say for the experience... I will not buy it again...</li>
    <li> I ordered theses two vials due to the picture above and I received 2 small samples that said not for individual sale. They were not tubes as shown. They were like the small samples you get in magazines when they are advertising face creams.  You will have to use both of them for a one time application. They are not vials. I would suggest not to waste your money.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. Even after I put my makeup on I could feel &amp; see it working.  #imamazed!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like they said</li>
    <li> I purchased this for mom and it is great. I need to not use too much of it so I&#x27;m still working on just the right amount of usage. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> great price for someone wanting to try this before buying a large quantity. Super-speedy shipping made this transaction a big plus as I was just itching to try it out. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Very nice. It does what it say.</li>
