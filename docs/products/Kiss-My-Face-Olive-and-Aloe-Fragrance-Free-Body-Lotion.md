      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
      <li>I choose it because of the listed ingredients, many of which will promote collagen production.</li>

      <li>If you can&#x27;t make your own, it is a more natural lotion that you can feel comfortable with applying to your body&#x27;s largest organ (skin).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and keeps my hands moisturized.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased with how it gets absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on light</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and nicely moisturizes.</li>
      <li>Seems to have good natural ingredients, that&#x27;s what i wanted.</li>
      <li>It does a great job and is gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>so I wanted to purchase a moisturizer that was more natural and safe.</li>
      <li>This is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried to far.</li>
      <li>Super sensitive skin... love it!</li>
      <li>Love that it isn&#x27;t scented, and really moisturizes my skin.</li>
      <li>I have kind of sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The scent is very mild, and is easy on sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s really helped keep my skin smooth &amp; hydrated</li>
      <li>good stuff, not as &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; as I like a moisturizer, but that is solved by getting my fingertips wet and massaging it in after applying.</li>
      <li>I use this on my hands and neck mostly or with an  oil on my face if its super dry.</li>
      <li>It is a great daily moisturizer, free of any harsh chemicals that I avoid.</li>
      <li>and theres no weird residue feeling at all.</li>
      <li>Wow this stuff is so silky smooth</li>
      <li>It has worked fantastic so far.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it, and I still do, but...........they seem to have changed the formula some.  </li>
      <li>It goes on with a white film but blends in easily and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>and it certainly moisturizes my skin without making it greasy.</li>
      <li>I guess it is light enough not to leave a greasy residue, it moisturizes well, and the scent is very neutral.</li>
      <li>but it is very emollient.  </li>
      <li>Not oily on my face, really helps with my sunburnt skin as well</li>
      <li>My Face during a Whole Foods visit,</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion for my husband as we are trying to get away from the parabens and other toxins in most lotions.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer is very gentle and has no harsh scent.</li>
      <li>I use it mainly on my face</li>
      <li>The consistency is decent quality.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>( I find that using a gentle cleanser actually has eliminated my needs for an all-over moisturizer on my face, since I am not stripping it of its natural oils).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m skin sensitive</li>
      <li>Within a minute I developed redness and itching around the nuckles of my hands.</li>
      <li>The only moisturizer I use on face and body- very helpful with eczema.</li>
      <li>I am surprised because Kiss</li>
      <li>My cuticles and nails are pretty dry during the winter</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and can only use Aveeno Calming facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My husband has very dry hands and has to wash them frequently in his line of work.</li>
      <li>It is a little heavier than I was wanting, but I use it all over my body and not so much on my face instead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s so gentle and nicely moisturizes.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer and scent free which is important to me</li>
    <li> good stuff, not as &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; as I like a moisturizer, but that is solved by getting my fingertips wet and massaging it in after applying. Seems to have good natural ingredients, that&#x27;s what i wanted. Olive oil is one of them, and it is good for your skin.</li>
    <li> I like it that the product came up among the lowest toxicity score on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have used on my face. It is not greasy, does not break me out and is an excellent value for the money. I like that this has no fragrance. I am 48 and proud to say I DO NOT look my age.I use only Kiss my Face products and I love them.</li>
    <li> Super sensitive skin... love it!</li>
    <li> Very thick and oily feeling.  I am surprised because Kiss My Face has excellent products.  I think this is marketed for use on the face and neck but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for that.  I basically used it on my hands, and even then it didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin fully.</li>
    <li> It is a great daily moisturizer, free of any harsh chemicals that I avoid. It is a little heavier than I was wanting, but I use it all over my body and not so much on my face instead. ( I find that using a gentle cleanser actually has eliminated my needs for an all-over moisturizer on my face, since I am not stripping it of its natural oils). I love that I can use this all over everywhere.</li>
    <li> Such a large size for a great price! Love that it isn&#x27;t scented, and really moisturizes my skin. I use it day &amp; night &amp; it&#x27;s really helped keep my skin smooth &amp; hydrated</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have strong smell.I use this on my hands and neck mostly or with an  oil on my face if its super dry.</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer I use on face and body- very helpful with eczema. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without  this.</li>
    <li> great size. great feel. just what i needed....xoxoxo</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this lotion, it is fragrance free, goes on nicely, and feels like it soaks in--in a good way.  I have kind of sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.  There is no smell.  The consistency is decent quality.  I have it at my desk at work, so I can put it on when I arrive in the morning because I was rushed getting out of the house--plus offices can seem very dry, so I like having something I can put on at work, if needed.  It was a good price and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not oily on my face, really helps with my sunburnt skin as well, I like this product and will buy again</li>
    <li> Very lovely feel to the moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way. I use it mainly on my face and I am pleased with how it gets absorbed into my skin. It works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> My husband has very dry hands and has to wash them frequently in his line of work. He hates the greasy feel (not to mention the scent) of most lotions. We picked up a bottle of Kiss My Face during a Whole Foods visit, and he loves it! I guess it is light enough not to leave a greasy residue, it moisturizes well, and the scent is very neutral.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive moisturizer that works so well. I&#x27;ve been using expensive moisturizers for years that just made my skin too oily until I found this product. Kiss My Face Moisturizer was a great find, it doesn&#x27;t have any hazardous chemicals and it certainly moisturizes my skin without making it greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer. It moisturizes my skin without leaving it greasy! And I thought it was a good bargain overall price-wise for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I used this once on my hands. Within a minute I developed redness and itching around the nuckles of my hands. It lasted hours. Now two days later my hands are still red in the nuckles area and now have dry, scaly patches there -- that were not there before. I threw the bottle in the garbage. Total waste of money for me. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s not grease and it hasn&#x27;t made me breakout!</li>
    <li> It is ok to use on hand, not face because it has some fragrance that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I got this the other day after trying &amp; taking back several vegan, natural lotions. This is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried to far. It&#x27;s very light, so I may need something else in the winter, but it&#x27;s good for replacing oils after a shower. I use it on my body. As an Esthetician I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be comfortible putting it on my face.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer</li>
    <li> Bought this moisturizer for my hands. My cuticles and nails are pretty dry during the winter so I wanted to purchase a moisturizer that was more natural and safe. I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. It&#x27;s smooth and keeps my hands moisturized.</li>
    <li> This creamy white moisturizer is what I now use under make up on my face and neck.  I like it for my hands as well.  It is like a drink for parched skin without a greasy feel.  It does a great job and is gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is wonderful! It goes on light but it is very emollient.  I keep touching my face during the day and it still feels moist to the touch.  It even cleared up an annoying dry patch on my face that I have not been able to get rid of, and I&#x27;ve tried much heavier creams with no results.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is so silky smooth and theres no weird residue feeling at all. The smell is amazing! I&#x27;m skin sensitive and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t agree with me but no problems here. I&#x27;ll buy more then this runs out....love it!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very gentle and has no harsh scent. It goes on with a white film but blends in easily and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an interim moisturizer until I received all od the ingredients I need to make my own.  It has worked fantastic so far.  We use it on our face and body, and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any break outs.  The scent is very mild, and is easy on sensitive skin.  If you can&#x27;t make your own, it is a more natural lotion that you can feel comfortable with applying to your body&#x27;s largest organ (skin).</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great feeling on my skin, not oily, not dry, just perfect!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this, but it broke my face out.  I now use it as hand lotion.  Works pretty good for that!  I have VERY sensitive skin and can only use Aveeno Calming facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I love that it is fragrance free and it is very light. I use it everywhere, including my face. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am using this on my arms and legs as well as my face and neck.  It smooths on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  I choose it because of the listed ingredients, many of which will promote collagen production.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my husband as we are trying to get away from the parabens and other toxins in most lotions.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this moisturizer.  I have dry skin and this cream did not work at all for me</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it, and I still do, but...........they seem to have changed the formula some.  It&#x27;s not as olive oily as my previous purchases, and doesn&#x27;t saturate the skin as well.  However, it&#x27;s still the best moisturizer I have found for my hands, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
