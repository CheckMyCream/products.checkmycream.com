      <li>This has a magnificent, indulgent feel and scent.</li>
      <li>Awesome product!!  </li>
      <li>Wonderful feel, smell and great skin.</li>
      <li>It smelled great.</li>
      <li>(I can attest to this!)&lt;br /&gt; - Smells great</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great lotion</li>
      <li>Great smell too.</li>
      <li>I love the way this lotion smells and am very happy.</li>
      <li>My wife loved this cream.</li>
      <li>We respectfully disagree!</li>
      <li>I love this cream!</li>
      <li>Nice Amazon Prime Subscribe n Save price.</li>
      <li>rose at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested the Weleda rose oil and that smells like roses, but not this.</li>
      <li>She really liked it and she has quite discriminating taste.</li>
      <li>This rose</li>
      <li>Its perfect for summer when I want something lighter and naturally fragrant.</li>
      <li>, no naughty chemicals wonderful sent what more could you want?</li>
      <li>Also this doesn&#x27;t make me break out the way most lotions do.</li>
      <li>Love love love this</li>
      <li>Love Weleda skin products, don&#x27;t like their scents.  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant scent, though more &#x27;green&#x27; than &#x27;rose&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Oh well, it was cheap.</li>
      <li>Super quick shipment love this product. .</li>
      <li>I do prefer to use it on dryer parts of my body (elbows, knees, etc) rather than everywhere because it is so rich.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant, it is somewhat a whimsical rose.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend really loves this lotion and talks about it more than I&#x27;ve ever heard her talk about a lotion before.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong at first, but once I apply the lotion</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure part of the reason is genetically, &amp;#34;good skin&amp;#34; and a healthy diet, but using Weleda products are a big help, too.</li>
      <li>Love the lotion - thick and creamy and absorbs well, love the smell more!</li>
      <li>Only lotion, that keeps my pregnant belly comfortably moisturized, free from itchiness and stretch marks :-)</li>
      <li>I wish the scent lasted longer because it&#x27;s so fresh and rose-y, but it fades and doesn&#x27;t clash with other scents I may apply, so it&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion for several years and love it.</li>
      <li>it smells like real roses!</li>
      <li>It feels very nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon and Thanks Weleda.</li>
      <li>unique vacuum design lifts the lotion up the inside of the bottle</li>
      <li>We read the reviews on here and were surprised other people didn&#x27;t like it more.</li>
      <li>Love it, but too pricy for little cream.</li>
      <li>light and natural rose smell - not heavy or fake, and obviously the quality of Weleda skincare.</li>
      <li>Not only are their products void of chemicals and harmful ingredients, but they always perform better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever known!</li>
      <li>For some reason the one I purchased (for a really low price) through a reseller came with only the back sticker and no front sticker, but it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 70 year old woman with sensitive, dry-normal skin</li>
      <li>- Not heavy, so</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily last long on my very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I get frequent guesses that I am 20 years younger than my actual age.</li>
      <li>Lotion dried not too quickly yet not too long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this cream! Its perfect for summer when I want something lighter and naturally fragrant. For some reason the one I purchased (for a really low price) through a reseller came with only the back sticker and no front sticker, but it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Love it, but too pricy for little cream. Not a good value.</li>
    <li> I like this body lotion quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The scent is very pleasant, it is somewhat a whimsical rose. The scent is strong at first, but once I apply the lotion and it dries/soaks in the scent decreases significantly, so only a faint reminder is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Lotion dried not too quickly yet not too long. It feels very nourishing and moisturizing. I do prefer to use it on dryer parts of my body (elbows, knees, etc) rather than everywhere because it is so rich. On my chest and neck it leaves a somewhat greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The lotion seems to work well for hours so there is no need to reapply (unless I wash it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great lotion and I recommend it to anyone who likes roses.</li>
    <li> Everytime I try a Weleda product, I am blown away by the quality and satisfaction it delivers!  Not only are their products void of chemicals and harmful ingredients, but they always perform better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever known!</li>
    <li> Greasy feel.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like roses.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really loves this lotion and talks about it more than I&#x27;ve ever heard her talk about a lotion before. I like it too. We read the reviews on here and were surprised other people didn&#x27;t like it more. The one lady seemed to say that there was a \\&quot;problem\\&quot; with the company because there was something wrong with scent. We respectfully disagree!</li>
    <li> It smelled great. I got it for my exGF for her b-day and she ended up texting some guy that same day. We broke up about a week later.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipment love this product. .</li>
    <li> This has a magnificent, indulgent feel and scent. Get it only if you deserve it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for several years and love it. I even slather it on my face after a shower and leave it as a moisturizer during the day. I&#x27;m a 70 year old woman with sensitive, dry-normal skin and I have minimal wrinkles. I get frequent guesses that I am 20 years younger than my actual age. I&#x27;m sure part of the reason is genetically, &amp;#34;good skin&amp;#34; and a healthy diet, but using Weleda products are a big help, too. I wish the scent lasted longer because it&#x27;s so fresh and rose-y, but it fades and doesn&#x27;t clash with other scents I may apply, so it&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
    <li> Love Weleda skin products, don&#x27;t like their scents.  This rose scented lotion is no exception.  I wrote to them and asked if they had a body lotion with lavender (or anything else), but no.</li>
    <li> Love love love this, no naughty chemicals wonderful sent what more could you want? Also this doesn&#x27;t make me break out the way most lotions do.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  Great smell too.</li>
    <li> The best smelling and moisturizing lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t have that artificial floral sent..it smells like real roses!</li>
    <li> Not exactly the scent I was looking for, but it will do.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant scent, though more &#x27;green&#x27; than &#x27;rose&#x27;. It absorbs quickly, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily last long on my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> unique vacuum design lifts the lotion up the inside of the bottle so you can use all of it. light and natural rose smell - not heavy or fake, and obviously the quality of Weleda skincare. Nice Amazon Prime Subscribe n Save price.</li>
    <li> I was notified that the product was out of stock and that they would deliver it as soon as it came in, They did and I got it just a few days later than expected. I love the way this lotion smells and am very happy.</li>
    <li> I agree with others here--this smells funny, vaguely chemical, not like rose at all. I&#x27;ve tested the Weleda rose oil and that smells like roses, but not this. Oh well, it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feel, smell and great skin. Only lotion, that keeps my pregnant belly comfortably moisturized, free from itchiness and stretch marks :-)</li>
    <li> Love the lotion - thick and creamy and absorbs well, love the smell more!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this cream. I gave it to her as one of a few Valentine&#x27;s day gifts.  She really liked it and she has quite discriminating taste. Thanks Amazon and Thanks Weleda.</li>
    <li> My wife who has very sensitive skin has tired about a million body lotions.  This one has 4 things going for it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin&lt;br /&gt; - Not heavy, so no greasy/oily residue&lt;br /&gt; - Softens the skin dramatically (I can attest to this!)&lt;br /&gt; - Smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Only comes in small bottles, so price is a bit much comparatively</li>
