    <li> I love this product!! Goes on smooth &amp; lasts all day!!</li>
    <li> This brow powder is magical. It has a great, natural looking color and does not come off easily. I can easily apply it to my eyebrows with pretty much anything: brow brush, cotton swab, and even bobby pins/my finger in a pinch. Work great with brow gel. I&#x27;ve had one for two years, apply it every single morning, and there is STILL so much left! Great value.</li>

    <li> Where have you been all my life!! Its like eye brow magic! and if applied lightly it looks natural!</li>
    <li> This brow powder is much too light for someone with black hair like myself. It also did not last long at all. I was pretty disappointed, I gave it to my friend who has blonde hair, it matched better but did not last.</li>
    <li> This powder is so easy to use but a little goes a long way. Love that&#x27;s there&#x27;s two different colors for filling and shading. I don&#x27;t think I can ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> Anastasia eye brow powder is the best on the market.  Just make sure you have a nice eyebrow brust and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
