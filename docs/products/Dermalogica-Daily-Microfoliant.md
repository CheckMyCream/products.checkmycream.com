      <li>I love Dermalogica and there are several products I can&#x27;t go without!</li>
      <li>I have used the daily microfoliant for years, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>First tried it when given a sample at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and was hooked.</li>
      <li>but yes, it most definitely was.</li>
      <li>Really makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans very well</li>
      <li>received well and fast</li>
      <li>With really oily skin and pores, I need something that cleans my skin without making it over-react by over producing oil and sebum.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice powder that turns into paste when you add a few drops of water.</li>
      <li>Skin feels smooth, clean, pores tight, but no drying or burning.  </li>

      <li>The top of this size bottle actually screws off, so you can get every last bit of product out.  </li>
      <li>Deep cleans and makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It was fresh new an arrived fast will be back!</li>
      <li>My husband &amp; I have been using the Dermalogical daily microfoliant for the past two month, we loved</li>
      <li>This is for the new one that does not say that.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses this product on a daily basis and pays in excess off $50 locally for a bottle less than half the size of this!&lt;br /&gt;Product shipped promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Only skin treatment recommended after facial that was worth it!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It helps to keep their skin clear.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Very pricey in office, but saw this size container and the price on Amazon site and thought &#x27;this can&#x27;t be the same product&#x27;,</li>
      <li>Just naturally glowing skin.</li>
      <li>The old one said &amp;#34;For</li>
      <li>so my skin is getting buffed slowly but surely.  </li>
      <li>(we live in a very arid area and we all get chapped during the winter) and he was surprised at the immediate difference - he moisturized right away after his shower and no more itching!</li>
      <li>It is mild for sensitive skin, and still manages to slough off the dead skin.  </li>
      <li>The new one is not nearly as abrasive as the old one.</li>
      <li>The pour spout is a great size (the pour spout is ridiculously small of the small size bottles and so much product is wasted).  </li>
      <li>Dermalogica is expensive in general, this super size really helps to lower the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>The microfoliant also gently dislodges white and black heads</li>

<li> Dermalogica&#x27;s Daily Microfoliant is the only product I can use on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out, have dry skin, or any other adverse reactions.</li>
<li> It is pricey, but it does last a long time.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not completely clear whether asbestos is the only problem or whether talc itself is cancer causing.  </li>
<li> recently had my husband use this on some dry patches of skin</li>
<li> This product is a little pricey but was recommended by my esthetician since my skin is sensitive.  </li>
<li> I frequently break out on my shoulders, neck and back, so I keep this just outside my shower (NOT in the shower - it will absorb the moisture and turn hard as a brick!) and use it regularly on those areas as well as daily on my face.  </li>
<li> Dermalogica changed their product not too long ago.</li>
<li> This is a rice-based product that \\&quot;melts\\&quot; with just a little water, and provides a gentle removal of dead skin cells from your face and neck.</li>
<li> This cleanser is a must-have for people who have dry skin with acne.</li>
<li> I thought my skin was dry</li>
<li> No stiffness, or dry skin.</li>
<li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> &quot; you can find with a lot of exfoliant products that use walnut or other substance-based.</li>
<li> My daughter will be a lifelong customer!</li>
<li> no so much of black heads as before.</li>
<li> I would not recommend everyday....</li>
<li> I discovered this microfoliant from a small sample.  </li>
<li> Been using this for the past years.</li>
<li> Not sure whether talc is harmful or not anymore.  </li>

    <li> Terrible product. I threw it out thats how bad it was.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, my girlfriend was very happy</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using for a year now....Great microfoliant...I would not recommend everyday....but every 2-3 days....</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for the past years. Happy with the speed of shipping and product</li>
    <li> Dermalogica&#x27;s Daily Microfoliant is the only product I can use on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out, have dry skin, or any other adverse reactions. I love this product and I&#x27;ve used it for three years now. It&#x27;s a nice powder that turns into paste when you add a few drops of water. It doesn&#x27;t smell strong, it works wonders for my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. Thank you Dermalogica!</li>
    <li> This is a rice-based product that \\&quot;melts\\&quot; with just a little water, and provides a gentle removal of dead skin cells from your face and neck. It goes on smooth, with no \\&quot;scratching\\&quot; you can find with a lot of exfoliant products that use walnut or other substance-based. I have used this product for years, and it was recommended by a top salon expert at a spa in Santa Fe, NM. The results, and product quality, have been consistent over the years.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliant on the market, no perfumes not super grainy.. rice enzymes.. As an esthetician, I love using and suggesting this product.  I only use this product three times a week, but can be used daily.</li>
    <li> received well and fast</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I have been using the Dermalogical daily microfoliant for the past two month, we loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans very well, it brighten our faces and deep clean the pores.&lt;br /&gt;My pores look smaller &amp; no so much of black heads as before.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product. No stiffness, or dry skin. Just naturally glowing skin. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for an awesome product have been using it for 9 years. It was fresh new an arrived fast will be back!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product on a daily basis and pays in excess off $50 locally for a bottle less than half the size of this!&lt;br /&gt;Product shipped promptly and in perfect condition. My daughter will be a lifelong customer!</li>

Leaves my face soft and smooth, ready to soak up all the great moisture in the other Dermalogica products that I use (I use many of them because I&#x27;m so happy with the difference they&#x27;ve made for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had my husband use this on some dry patches of skin (we live in a very arid area and we all get chapped during the winter) and he was surprised at the immediate difference - he moisturized right away after his shower and no more itching!</li>
    <li> This product smoothers into a non-greasy foam but the packaging is not so great.  The holes are too big causing a lot of wastage when i pour it out.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent exfoliator! Also, Amazon had the best price for it. My skin has vastly improved since using it, and I love how it foams up for a nice clean without the dry feeling. This cleanser is a must-have for people who have dry skin with acne. I love it!</li>
    <li> Have bought this from the spa.  It is much less expensive online.  It is an outstanding product which leaves the skin soft.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning as a perk/boost to my cleansing rountine.  It makes my skin feel super clean and smooth - and I notice a big difference when I use it - and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I discovered this microfoliant from a small sample.  With really oily skin and pores, I need something that cleans my skin without making it over-react by over producing oil and sebum.  Because that&#x27;s what happens with most soap &amp; cleansers I use.  The microfoliant also gently dislodges white and black heads so my skin is getting buffed slowly but surely.  I also use the clay cleanser which again helps control oil.</li>
    <li> This Cleans pores and makes them appear smaller. Very gentle. Love this product and like the large more economical size.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether talc is harmful or not anymore.  Did read that as of 1975 talc with asbestos can&#x27;t be sold anymore but it&#x27;s not completely clear whether asbestos is the only problem or whether talc itself is cancer causing.  But was disappointed to find it in here non the less.</li>
    <li> Have used for years!  Only skin treatment recommended after facial that was worth it!  Skin feels smooth, clean, pores tight, but no drying or burning.  Very gentle, so can also use on neck and decolletage.  My daughter is moving into Teen years and I may have her try in small amount if acne ever an issue. Have bought elsewhere, but this is best price.  Came very quickly!  I order when I get low and this arrived before I was out.</li>
    <li> I love Dermalogica and there are several products I can&#x27;t go without! Daily Microfoliant is one of them! To be able to get it in a larger container is fab! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product line and I love this specific product. First tried it when given a sample at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and was hooked. Very pricey in office, but saw this size container and the price on Amazon site and thought &#x27;this can&#x27;t be the same product&#x27;, but yes, it most definitely was. Deep cleans and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> Use it every morning, gets rid of the dirt from the day.</li>
    <li> This is a must have with the Dermologica Medibac Clearing skin wash.  It keeps your face exfoliated without the harshness of some facial scrubs.  It is more of a polish than scrub.  It smells great and keeps my face clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  My dermatologist recommended it to me and I&#x27;m glad she did.  I have sensitive skin and this does a nice job of exfoliating my skin without causing irritation.  It is pricey, but it does last a long time.  My husband uses it, too, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his rosacea.  That&#x27;s impressive!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. HOWEVER, it is NOT the one in the picture. Dermalogica changed their product not too long ago. The old one said &amp;#34;For all skin conditions&amp;#34; on the front as this one does. IT IS NOT THAT ONE! This is for the new one that does not say that. Why does it matter? I&#x27;ll tell you why. The new one is not nearly as abrasive as the old one. It does the job. It&#x27;s great actually. But the old one is better. And this advertisement is MISLEADING!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m attaching a picture of the difference. The one on the left is what is being advertised. The one on the right is the one you&#x27;ll get.</li>
    <li> This product is a little pricey but was recommended by my esthetician since my skin is sensitive.  I thought my skin was dry and I shouldn&#x27;t use an exfoliant but this has actually improved the quality of my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughters use this product &amp; they love it.  It is actually a powder -- not a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to keep their skin clear.</li>
    <li> best skin care products on the market at this price point.</li>
    <li> I love Dermalogica!  I have used the daily microfoliant for years, and I love it.  It is a great product for combination skin.  It is mild for sensitive skin, and still manages to slough off the dead skin.  The best part - is this bottle.  The top of this size bottle actually screws off, so you can get every last bit of product out.  The pour spout is a great size (the pour spout is ridiculously small of the small size bottles and so much product is wasted).  Dermalogica is expensive in general, this super size really helps to lower the cost per use.&lt;br /&gt;If you are want to see how these products are so great, buy a sample set, then you can see how great it is and you will be hooked!</li>
