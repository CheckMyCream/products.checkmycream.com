<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For short hair only and a little time consuming but great results</li>
    <li> Great product and delivers Result! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron!  Originally, I bought this for my 9 year old niece and ended up buying one for myself!  It is so easy to use that my 10 year old used it not the first try</li>
    <li> Curling Iron came nicely packaged but did not turn on or work at all. :(</li>
    <li> Great Curling Iron!  Easy use and makes really nice curls for long hair!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the Professional Curling Iron -Spiral Hair curler by Curliz  by Xtava for free.  I love curling my hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for the new best thing. I can say Xtava did a great job it retails for $19.99. I have wavy hair so I have to straighten or curler my hair. I love using the Professional Curling Iron -Spiral Hair. I&#x27;m so happy I got the pink one it&#x27;s my favorite color. You have to get 1 to 2 inches small pieces of hair put in the Spiral Curling Iron and roll it&#x27;s that easy. The curling iron came in a really nice black box for easy storage. It heats up really fast and has a little plastic guard at the end so if you touch it, your fingers don&#x27;t get burned. I really love the Professional Curling Iron it&#x27;s different from other curling irons that I&#x27;ve used and it does take a little practice to used it but after a few tries I found it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My iron arrived in a box beautiful black box and it was well packed. Makes a great gift for that special person.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeee itt!!! Just perfect and excelent costumer service ;) totally recomended</li>
    <li> My daughter bought one of these and it lasted a couple years, she loved it so much I bought her another and one for my wife. They searched several stores and couldn&#x27;t find them so i ordered them here. It was super fast shipping and they both couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. Will definitely order again if they break. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been that good at curling my hair, it always managed to get twisted up in the clamp and look silly. This curling iron is a dream come true. Its so simple and easy, it takes me 15 minutes to curl my hair with this. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants perfect, easy, quick curls!</li>
    <li> I love it.  it works well!  Others are always asking me about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter.  We have tried numerous different curling options because her hair does not like to hold curl for more than two hours.  This is amazing with her hair.  The curl stays in all day.  She even has amazing waves when she brushes it out the next day. Her hair stays wavy until she washes it.  She uses it all by herself without help.  The more she uses it the quicker she gets at it. Everyone compliments her hair when she uses this.</li>
    <li> So love this curler and the curls stay</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I was looking for those goldie locks curls. I have very straight hair, I can&#x27;t get over how nice my curls came out and how long they lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gone to the beauty parlor to get them done and they always fell out, not with this baby!&#x27;  I have since purchased another for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item hands down!</li>
    <li> The spiral curler did a great job with my hair. Perfect for hairstyles where you want that perfect curl.  I enjoyed the guide that helps ensure that the curls are perfectly the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive mine and try it out.  My hair is pretty long and naturally curly, yet my curls aren&#x27;t always very well defined and they tend to get a bit frizzy.  In order to really see the full effect of the curler I blow dried my hair straight first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for personal use or for a great gift especially at only $19.99.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, got it for her for Christmas and she has used it twice already. great product.</li>
    <li> Not very good doesn&#x27;t curl well . Remington brand much better only rated 1 because it made me rate</li>
    <li> Lets talk curls! I have tried everything from a traditional curler to the Instyler Tulip. Nothing seems to make and hold curls like the Xtava Spiral curler! Achieve perfectly symmetric curls every time with the Xtava Curlz spiral guide. Never again will you forget to turn off your Curler with the LED button indicating the device is on. The xtava curlz handle is made of high quality insulation materials designed for safety. The secure hold clip guarantees the perfect curl as it locks your hair in place. 360 Degree rotating swivel cord allowing complete freedom of movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have extremely thick hair that never wants to hold curls, even when I use a ton of hairspray. I&#x27;m lucky to hold curls for an hour. With the Xtava Spiral Curler it starts curling with in 30 seconds but I recommend at lease 60 seconds for a nice firm curl. When you clip in your hair its like it knows where to go. It simply and easily guides your hair in place. My curls stayed on their own with no hairspray and lasted for hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also like the \\&quot;safe guard\\&quot; (what guides your hair) it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I even left it pressed against my skin while curling with no burns or hurting. All in all I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron for someone who has never used one before. I have shoulder length thin hair and was able to get pretty curls all the way up to the root. I really liked the way they looked! Not sure what people who rated it poorly thought was so complicated about it...</li>
    <li> very difficult to use. cord gets twisted and knotted. I will keep practicing though.</li>
    <li> An absolute joke...pulled a ton of hair out each time I tried to use it.  Worst thing, ever.</li>
    <li> takes too long to curl. Its ok</li>
    <li> This is just simply amazing! The far best one I&#x27;ve ever had. You can pull the curls and they go right back into place ( and I did it several times). For someone who really struggles with curling their hair this is the perfect item! It just takes seconds to have the perfect curl/curls. A big thumb up for this item! 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I love it and the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> quality is fair for the price, doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my taste</li>
    <li> After seeing all the reviews I figured I&#x27;d give this curler a try. I am so glad I did! It works great!!!!! I will definitely be getting my sister in law one for her birthday ! I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products. ^_^</li>
    <li> I used my wand to create a spiral curl look. The results was great! It was able to keep the curls for 3 days; curls were long-lasting. If I could change one thing about my wand I would make it longer because my hair is on my back (below my arm-pits) so I normally can&#x27;t curl from root to tip; otherwise I love my curling wand...</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for a child.  It is easy for them to use, and easy for the parent as well.  It does decent curls.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and works the best on my hard to do anything with hair. My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own and the first time I used it I had a little trouble getting the look I wanted but just used it for the second time and love the results. My hair never wants to just curl or stay straight and the curls always fall and my hair goes wavy when I straighten it. But with this, my curls lasted not only through the night out when I first used it, but while I slept and through the next day and I just put a light mist of hair spray on it. When I got married and wanted my hair curled the way this curler does, my hair didn&#x27;t do right and had to use enough hair spray to make my hair hard as a rock. And they still didn&#x27;t last. This curler is awesome.</li>
    <li> This was terrible sent it back as fast I received it.  You can do the same thing with a regular curling iron.  Just another gimick.</li>
    <li> Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. This product had a great package and this company is well known for their amazing and professional packaging. The curler iron itself comes in pink and it heat up fast so you want to be careful and keep this in mind. The product can be hold easily and if instructions are followed you should have great results and very nice curls .You will have medium  curls and they will stay long because this iron is great.</li>
    <li> I used this and it curls good. But I think it takes a while to get has to using it. I almost would rather use a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received item for free for product review to give honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My niece was so excited to receive this for Christmas, and loves the curls it produces</li>
    <li> She loves to work with hair and loved her gift!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything looking for a curl that will hold in my hair. I have super thin long straight hair that I swear is style resistant. Especially  living in Texas the humidity is ridiculous and hairstyles never hold very long. Lucky to have it hold more than 30mins then going back to straight as a board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I saw this curling iron I was extremely interested. It looks different than anything I&#x27;ve  seen or tried on my hair. I was excited to try it out and see how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Xtava professional curling iron comes in three different colors blue, orange, and pink. I chose pink because I love anything pink. I was not disappointed its a really pretty pink. The plastic spiral guides your hair in is super neat and provides a even curl throughout your whole head. The curling iron also heats up pretty quickly. Great quality for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When using make sure the clip that you put your hair in is facing downward. The plastic guide will guide your hair where in needs to be effortlessly. Just turn the curling iron clockwise. Leave the hair in the curling iron for 10 to 15 seconds for softer spiral curls. Leave the hair in the curling iron for 15 to 30 seconds for tighter longer lasting spiral curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I used it, it provided gorgeous  spiral curls that lasted all day long. TheXtava Professional Curling Iron : Spiral hair curler curls (Pink) has me wanting to wear my hair curly everyday because its so easy and quick to use. I absolutely love the plastic guide its has and how easy it is to have even curls throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You can purchase your here : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2WYAVE/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?</li>
    <li> I have medium length, very straight hair. This iron was ok, but was a little too much hassle for me. First off, the clip would not told my hair. Maybe my hair is too thin on the end, but it would not hold my end. Also, even though the cord had a spinner on it, it kept twisting up on me and I would have to stop, unplug, untwist, and resume. It made a nice curl, but would have taken me twice as long than just a regular curling iron or wand. I ended up returning it. Also, if your hair is longer than shoulder/medium length, I don&#x27;t think this would work for you. My hair coiled up to the max, and I don&#x27;t consider myself to have &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and it works great!!  It is so easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it when we opened it up.  It was a bit tricky at first, but she eventually got it.  It works great!  It gives the perfect curl that lasts.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Due to my hair being extremely coarse, it tends to be difficult to style.  For the most part I use a blow dryer and a round brush to get the style I desire.  Every once on a while though I want something a little more fun and as such thought I would give this spiral hair curler a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1: Secure clip holds your hair in place&lt;br /&gt;2: Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;3: Temperature is hot enough to even curl my hair&lt;br /&gt;4: Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1: Takes some time to get the hang of&lt;br /&gt;2: Hair catches on clip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent product that works well if your hair cooperates.  It does take some practice, but as long as you do not give up it will give you beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair curler received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was my first non traditional curling iron, so I was worried on how to use and the results. It is very easy to use, and the curls hold ALL day. After my normal morning curling, my curls tend to fall by lunch and gone shortly later. I continue my normal morning curl with my regular curling iron and now add additional curls with this iron, and those curls are still going strong when I return home after work. I love this curling iron and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This item is ok, but beware. If you hair is very fine, you will likely be unhappy with the results when using it. It would work better on hair with some natural wave or slight curl to it already, as it did very little at all to add wave to my hair. I would likely not recommend this item to anyone who has no natural wave or slight curl to their hair to begin with.  Susan</li>
    <li> I have needed a curling iron that actually curls my straight hair! This once took some getting used to at first since it is not the norm unit. You have to clip your hair into place then wrap around and curl. Once you get the hang of it you are golden and it doesn&#x27;t take lone to curl your hair. Nice quality product and packaging. I also love the vibrant pink color!! **I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie- I read the reviews on this curling iron and was SO EXCITED when I finally ordered it. I&#x27;ve had a couple of curling irons in the past with metal curl guides on them and just loved them to death. I rushed home the day it was delivered and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems with this curling iron are:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have reasonably thick hair. Even when I divided it into 1 in x 1/2 in sections, the clip was far too dainty to hold it all in at once. The clip seems far too lightweight for anyone except for those with THIN hair. I ended up dividing my hair into 1/2 in x 1/2 in sections (which I ended up with about 600 of, due to my thick hair) and STILL had to kind of hold the ends in as I spiraled the rest of my hair into the iron.&lt;br /&gt;2. Once I started winding my hair into the curl guides, the plastic was so wide that I could only get about half of my hair into it. Seriously? This curling iron is made for people with shorter than shoulder length hair. The highest curls I could get started at my chin, leaving me with half board-straight hair and half lovely, shiny spiral curls. Not my thing. Meaning once I curled all the ends of my hair, I THEN had to go back and curl the middle sections of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m spite of my discrepancies, the curls were beautiful, shiny, even, and VERY long-lasting. unfortunately it took me almost 2 1/2 hours to curl my whole head of hair. This would be an excellent iron for anyone with THIN, medium- to short-length hair. Have thick or longer hair? Keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t use this curling iron again. Twenty bucks down the toilet :(</li>
    <li> This is laughable and not in a good way, the seller was great the product is a joke I will try to give it away but I suspect it will be heading to the salvation army or good will.</li>
    <li> Hair gets caught in the too short clip</li>
    <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that will only hold curls from a straightener(done by others, I could not get that technique down). This tool takes a minute to get used to, but then it&#x27;s easy peasy! I used the same hair products with a regular curling iron only to have it straight after a few hours, the next day I used the same hair products but with xtava. After letting hair cool, I finger brushed. The curls held all day, slept with hair in a ponytail and these pics are when I woke up the next morning. Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> The Xtava curling iron is perfect for those of us who are less than adept at styling their hair.  Even though I had never used a curling iron quite like this, it was easy to figure out how to use it, and thanks to the guides on the barrel, the curls came out perfectly each time.  This curling iron would be best for medium to long hair and for a head full of natural-looking spiral curls.  (I think the barrel would be a bit big for shorter pieces or tight curls.)  It seems well-made and worth more than what I paid.</li>
    <li> Very nice my wife loves it. Nice seller too.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this Curling iron. It is cheap and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really loves this curling iron it is easy to use and heats up very fast and is well made. Customer service is just great we will see how long it last as she goes through curling irons but this one sure looks like it will last I will keep u posted.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daughters for Christmas they love it. When they first tried it they couldn&#x27;t get complete spirals so I went and brought curling spray and that did the trick. The great thing about this curling iron is my 13yr old can use this all by herself and I don&#x27;t have to worry about her burning herself.</li>
    <li> It is easy for new users and it comes okay.. Overall, it is worthy for its price.</li>
    <li> Works great !! Once you get use to it and learn how to use it . You will love it !! So much easier then using a regular one !</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this as I have used xtava products before and I absolutely love spiral curls. However, while the finished result looked alright, there were a few issues along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Gift - The curler comes really nicely packaged in a black box that would be perfect to give to anyone as a gift. It is also pretty affordable and would work for many budgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance - The curler has a very fun design to it. It&#x27;s different than many other spiral curlers that I have seen and the pink color gives it a very feminine, girly appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast - In the directions, it says that this will heat up within 2 minutes and it def. does! After about a minute, I was able to start curling without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use: This machine has one button and one button only. Click to turn the curler on, and click again to turn it off. That simple! No heat settings/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Clip - The clip that you use to hold your hair before curling is a pain. If you put too much hair in, it will just come loose and fall out. If you put too little in, it gets stuck under the clip and you have to pull it out causing damage to the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord - While the cord does swivel on the curler, it still wants to twist up on me. It is very soft and flexible, so I suppose that could be the problem.</li>
    <li> The clip at the bottom, used to hold the small section of hair pinches, doesn&#x27;t lift-clamp. Because of this you will get a couple hairs yanked out as you go. It would be great if the clip was better.</li>
    <li> This was a huge disappointment. I gave this to my daughter (age 14) as a christmas gift.  She has plenty of experience using curling irons and the problems she reported were:&lt;br /&gt;It got too hot, was awkward to use, burned fingers and did not make curls that stay very long. Basically this iron failed!&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to return things, so it&#x27;s sitting in the garage now.  If you care enough to send me the shipping -- i will gladly send it back for a refund. Otherwise, you got me!</li>
    <li> It took a few attempts to get the hang of this, but it is pretty simple.  I am amazed at how well it curls and the curls stay.  I have lots of hair, but am able to curl it all quickly.  Only takes 10-20 seconds a section.  I would highly recommend this.  Also, with the spiral &#x27;guide&amp;#34;, the heat is away from your head and your hands as you work.</li>
    <li> This would work great if you have super long think hair. My hair wouldn&#x27;t go into the spiral slots &amp; would only curl in one direction.</li>
    <li> It took a little bit to get the hang of getting hair into this just right. It&#x27;s just a little awkward to hold until you get used to it. After a few tries, I got used to it and it&#x27;s easy to use. I love that it can only be used one way, so you don&#x27;t end up curling backwards and get a kink in your hair if you&#x27;re not paying attention. I love the look of the curls it makes. I have had people question what was in my bathroom drawer, just from the looks of it. It definitely sparks some interesting conversations because it does look rather...like something else.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this curler in picture I was like finally I think there&#x27;s something that can curl my stubborn hair. This curler is like a cheat sheet for those girls who like me don&#x27;t know how to get good curls using just the wand. The curler came perfectly packaged, looked amazing even if you want to gift it to someone. It&#x27;s in pink color and very easy to operate though it did come with instructions. Just make sure to have the space you are using this in be clear of water. Once plugged in, pressing the black button turns on the curler and the led light turns to blue. The curler gets hot pretty quick so I started curling. I have very thick hair but the curler was able to give me nice curls. I was able to take some pictures but not very good one&#x27;s on my own (but definitely planning to take more when I use it again and re-upload). So far it&#x27;s amazing, I&#x27;ll definitely update with any suggestions or tips that I think could benefit everyone once I have used the curler for even longer amount of time. I do recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. All views represented above are my own and in no way influenced by anyone else.</li>
    <li> I received this in exchange for my honest feedback and review. I ended up sending this to my youngest sister for my niece&#x27;s hair. She said it was easy to use. Plus it gave my niece beautiful spiral curls for her first day back! She looked so cut but I am posting the back of hair since that is the focus. Her mother and I are very happy with the results and Princess T approves. Judging from how well it worked on my niece&#x27;s hair, if you have thick hair like hers you should be able to get those gorgeous spiral curls as well.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I love the color of this curling Iron. It also came in a nice thick box which is very nice which you can store it away in it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice design with the swival cord that it allows you to use the product without the cord getting tangled.&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few stuff from xtava and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;With this one it has a one button control which you push to turn on. There is a latch the you slide down which you put the end of your hair then let the latch close and it will hold your hair while you rotate the iron to curl your hair. It Is nice and simple.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that you measure you hair that you want to curl so you can get the nice and awesome curls. Also remember to slide down the latch before you pull the iron away from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Another point I want to make is to becareful becuase the top of the latch does get hot make sure you slide it with your thumb on the right place,like you see on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am loving this spiral hair curler my curls come out perfect and I can get the loose curls as well and be able to seperate them. The product is very sturdy and it is great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Sample was provided complimentary for testing and review purposes</li>
    <li> My sister loves it, and uses it to style her hair frequently! She says it mainly does curls, but can also do waves! Based on her satisfaction, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is very awkward to use. There is no control of the heating element, it&#x27;s just on HIGH.  Hair tangles in the clamp, breaking off.  I have thin fine hair,  could see where it would do the curl job, but afraid the bottom would burn while attempting to curl the rest.  Great concept.</li>
    <li> This product gives really good curls but you cannot curl both ways which was really disappointing because at the end of the day I just looks like waves instead of tight curls because the Curls merged together I suppose hairspray can hold it but it looks like you don&#x27;t know how to curl your hair and you cannot alternate the curler I recommend that you buy a similar one that you can curl both ways and if you have long hair and like really long like mine it does not reach the top of your head making the curl look even more akward</li>
