<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lather does not get hot enough, that&#x27;s enough of a reason for you not to buy this.  The foam should be steaming hot, not a lukewarm mush that this unit creates.</li>
    <li> Good quality for price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to replace the one he had used for many years.  At first he was disappointed that I bought the same brand (because he had been a bit frustrated with how his old one connected to the aerosol can of Edge Gel).  Apparently they have fixed the problem with this newer model though and it works great. He loves his Hot Lather System, and is very pleased with how it works.  This product has at least doubled in price since the last one we bought, but if it lasts another 5 years then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This arrived used.  Not cleaned up.  It just would not stop constantly shooting out gel.  It was a huge mess.</li>
    <li> The lather is warm at best.  t is also difficult to get the shaving can into the head of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get quite warm enough. But overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Gel doesn&#x27;t stay hot more than a few seconds.  I had used a previous model with lather - it seemed to stay hot longer.  I don&#x27;t think it is a design flaw just that the gel cools off faster than lather.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend but not returning.</li>
    <li> My husband has used the Conair lather system for about 10 years.  In that time we have purchased 4 or 5 of them.  The first one lasted about 4 or 5 years. All the rest have only lasted a year to 18 months before they quit altogether.  Still, the only one we can find so will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a beginning shaver, but I do believe that I will just appropriate it for my own use.  Who will know?</li>
    <li> Works great for a perfect shave</li>
    <li> Horrible.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.  The &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; was just marginal...I was expecting something comparable to what I would get at the barber shop.  I tried gel and it was a big mess.  Might have had better success with regular shaving cream but I tend to use more lotion based shaving products and really didn&#x27;t want to make any more mess in the bathroom.  Save your money and buy yourself something more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> This is the worst small appliance ever made. Right out of the box the thing wouldn&#x27;t turn on. It appeared that the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button was stuck down. I had to take all the screws out to get the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button to pop loose. Once it was back together I tried to use a can of gel in it. At first it wouldn&#x27;t dispense the gel. After fighting with it some more, it finally dispensed the gel, but it wasn&#x27;t the least bit warm. The next day I went to the store and bought a can of shaving foam, thinking that might make a difference. I put the can of foam in, let it &amp;#34;heat up&amp;#34; (I use the term &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; sarcastically), then pressed the button to dispense it. No foam came out of the dispensing head. HOWEVER, foam started coming out of every nook and cranny of the unit itself. It was so disastrous that it was comical. I wish I had taken a picture so that I could show you all just how insane it was. Needless to say, the foam didn&#x27;t heat up either. This was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Purchased this gel and lather heater for my husband and he is very pleased.  It does not require a special size lather product.  You can use your favorite right off the store shelf.</li>
    <li> Well you get what you pay for. This Chinese made product is not that great. The shaving cream comes out at best somewhat warm and not much better. Overall the product seems like it could break at any time. I think it could have done better if it were made state side.</li>
    <li> My father has used these things for years - tried it once and will never go back!  So nice that these use standard cartridges rather than the custom ones they used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m writing this review because I always buy my Dad a new one of these when his gets broken from dropping it or it wears out after many years of use).</li>
    <li> Hmm, ok well slightly warm is slightly better than cold, but only slightly.  Its hardly noticeable after you put it on.  It works, the can fits, its a little clunky to use and it requires 3 minutes to &#x27;heat&#x27; up to slightly above room temperature.  Its a big wasted effort for something that doesnt give the desired result, its cold on your face in 10 seconds or less.  It has to get HOT to be worth anything, this fails, I&#x27;ll probably throw it out with the can when its done. :(</li>
    <li> I wish the tempature of the lotion would get hotter.  It gets warm but not &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d still buy again since the price is right.</li>
    <li> It gets the heating done, would class it as good.</li>
    <li> Little flimsy in its construction.  A wireless, rechargeable version would be ideal.  For the price though, it gets the job done.  Slight learning curve may apply when attaching the pressurized cans of foam, take caution and wear  proper PPE.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased. They don&#x27;t last long. Although, I&#x27;m using it more than someone would at home</li>
    <li> it does the job works great</li>
    <li> This hot lather machine was a replacement for an old one I had and it operates great but I have a hard time using the Gillette Foamy lather it appears to be too thick for the machine but the Barbasol works great.</li>
    <li> HAD ONE BEFORE FOR YEARS.  MY HUSBAND LOVED IT.  GLAD I WAS ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER ONE.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes it and shipping was very fast. I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Perfect -- an item I could find nowhere in the Phoenix area. -- Delivered on time during the Xmas crunch.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works perfectly and was easy to assemble. My husband couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy.  Waste of money and does not actually heat shaving gel.  Getting the can in the appliance also was very finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use something like barbasol try it out but be prepared for very little heat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in Feb. 2015 its March 2015 it does not work, the lather is the same out of the can. It&#x27;s broke I figured out how to use it quickly but its made to last maybe around three months. I would not recommend it unless they improved it altogether from the heat to the craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Complicated and leaves you having o measure water&amp;lotion etc. Like you are prep-aring a 7 course meal. Disappointing&amp; a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I should have read all the reviews before wasting money on this.  This product is a great idea, done poorly.  If you read the product description, \\&quot;hot\\&quot; is repeated several times.  I guess \\&quot;hot\\&quot; is very relative.  My unit heats regular Gillette foam to only slightly above room temperature.  Hardly what I would call \\&quot;hot\\&quot; - not even what I would call \\&quot;warm\\&quot; and nowhere near what you might expect in a barber shop.  Tepid, at best.  I am gald I did not buy this as a present or I wouild have been very, very embarassed.  After three days and seven attempts, it is already residing in my garbage can. R.I.P.</li>
    <li> unit works great  - hot lather</li>
    <li> Husband was very disappointed. He wanted the lather to get Hot and it don&#x27;t get HOT. And I did notify Conair and they wouldn&#x27;t give refund, said take it back and exchange it. Don&#x27;t want to exchange it. Don&#x27;t want it. But stuck with it. Hopefully will find him another brand that will get hot. I will look for reviews on it.</li>
    <li> Husband had one for years and years and it finally died so he replaced it.  Now he&#x27;s a happy camper.  Grump for a month til he got his hot lather...LOL</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use</li>
    <li> Works as specified, but makes the lather a little runny.</li>
    <li> The Conair Gel and Lather Machine eliminated the lubricity of my shaving cream, which resulted in a rough and unpleasant shaving experience.</li>
    <li> looking forward to using in barbershop</li>
    <li> love it, works great, just hard to figure out how to do the first install of gel can.  on/off buttons little confusing as its always red light when plugged in so I just plug in in morning and literally 2 minutes later its very hot.  I left it plugged in and checked on it all day while doing home chores and it was fine so if I forget to unplug when done in morning I will not worry</li>
    <li> Lasted six months and then burned out.</li>
    <li> I tried using gel with this product and I did not heat anything.  I do not know how it works with cream, but I will return mine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price and delivered in two days.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the first one. The first one only lasted two months. I will not buy another one like this one.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price!</li>
    <li> the lather comes out to thin and not hot enough</li>
    <li> I returned the unit to Conair this week.  I put in the lather, push down on the top and no lather came out.  I reinserted the lather several times and still no lather came out.  I tried another can of lather and still no lather came out.  The unit also appeared to have been used because there was residual lather  inside the heating unit.  I requested Conair replace or repair the unit.</li>
    <li> I love this machine, it&#x27;s great for shaving</li>
    <li> This worked for a week dispensing lukewarm shaving cream before I came back to a massive soap explosion that seems to have turned this piece of junk into a paperweight.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it&#x27;s the third one I&#x27;ve purchased for him.</li>
    <li> could not make it work. I wasted a can of shave cream on it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  My last one broke after 7+ years.  I bought this and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes shaving so much easier (I have sensitive skin)</li>
    <li> Functional but finicky.  Wish there were a better alternative in this price range.</li>
    <li> good product heats up your favourite shaving gel nice and warm perfect for that smooth shave.</li>
    <li> this product which i had purchased is the worst because it doesn&#x27;t even heat up how can anybody even try to sell this it&#x27;s a shame because i bought one yrs ago and it was fine and that&#x27;s why i bought this one which is a complete opposite of what i had before</li>
    <li> Very good product. I shave 2 or 3 times a week. I use this product(with gel) everytime I shave. Works really good.</li>
    <li> does not heat up lather well.</li>
    <li> I had a previous model of this product that worked great.  It was a gift that delivered hot foam for nearly 10 years.  It finally bit the dust.  It was a no-brainer for me to go back to the same brand.  Sadly, this one is a big disappointment.  On my old machine it was no problem installing a can of shave cream.  This one is a mess.  I hook up a can and it spews half the can before finally getting it seated properly.  The only time it doesn&#x27;t deliver a strong stream is when I want it to.  After heating up, I depress the dispenser and I get a slow drizzle of slightly above room temperature foam.  By the time it has dispensed enough for a shave, it has gone cold.  IMHO This is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> A hot shave so much better than cold lather</li>
    <li> Worst product available on Amazon.  I would rate this as minus five stars</li>
    <li> Product is horrible. It does not heat the shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and does a great job of heating your shaving lather for a warm smooth shave. Worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes.  However, after owning it for two weeks the seal between the warmer head and the nozzle separated and the aerosol now leaks out. I can&#x27;t return it and can&#x27;t use it, so it is useless.  Another worthless product which could have been great if they would added 15 cents worth of more plastic to make it functional.  Do not waste your money unless there is clear evidence that CONAIR has fixed their quality control and design issues.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks, shaving cream began to ooze out of the nozzle and crevices when in use and turned off</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk, not well made and I had problem with it leaking shaving cream.. Don&#x27;t buy this..</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband and he loves it. easy to load shave cream/gel into. warms us nicely.</li>
    <li> should have read the reviews before buying!  simply put, it does not work.  Does not heat.  Does not dispense cleanly.</li>
    <li> It does a good job for the price.  I&#x27;ve owned several of these in the past and they do have a limited life.  But, it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Yes, works like a champ.  Nice and hot lather once you ask for it.  Easy to load and get the thing going.  Would buy again, if I needed another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this warmer for about 6 months now and I am very pleased with it. It is touchy when installing a new can but worth the trouble! I use gel and have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I now own 2 of these units.  The cream is not so hot that it is uncomfortable but you can adjust the temp on the unit.  I got so spoiled with the comfort this brings to shaving I decided to leave my old one in our place in Fla. and bought this new one for home.  I have had the first unit for, at least, 4 years now.  It takes a while to get used to hooking the shaving gel can to the unit when you first try to attach to the unit and because the gel lasts 2-3 months, get but you will get it and you won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
    <li> If the item worked the way it is suppose to, it would of been a great item. Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t perform. The shaving cream doesn&#x27;t even get up to a warm temperature. I bought 2. I&#x27;m thinking about sending them both back.</li>
    <li> AWFUL Does not Work, Sloppy Function, AND non-returnable. SCREWED ON THIS PURCHASE... BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> Lather watery.  Barely warm.  Have read instructions and tried repeatedly.  Will go into a yard sale bin. A waste of time to order and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Had it for couple of months now, pretty good</li>
    <li> I love hot lather for shaving and this works perfectly. I had another one for 20 yrs that finally broke.</li>
    <li> I had one of these puppies before, but this one is the new improved model. Sturdy stand and easy to use. I use gel and well, it can di that wonderfully...</li>
    <li> The lather is not as thick as I would like or as it is when not heated. Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these before, but it only lasted about 1-1/2 years.  But other than that I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Does not heat gel enough and waste gel by releasing too much air from the can. Waste of money, do nog purchase.</li>
    <li> Worst impulse purchase of my Amazon.com career. This thing is useless. The shaving cream (gel in my instance) ended up smelling like burning plastic and the thing took up way too much space. I have no idea what I was thinking.</li>
    <li> Did not work with various brands of shave cream and gel that we tried.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this thing even makes sales. Assembly was relatively easy, but once I got the canister in, the thing WOULD NOT stop emitting the shaving gel/foam. I literally wasted a whole half a canister on it before I just gave up. I turned the thing on and off to try to stop it, but the top portion of the device continued to apply pressure to the canister head, thus making the thing non-stop emit shaving gel. The top button also did not work. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING.</li>
    <li> I got my lather heathing system the next day when I ordered it.  I was very happy but the directions were a bit complicated.  I finally was able to figure it out but I was disapointed - the lather doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it also very hard to get the lather out of the machine.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my boyfriend. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. Still going strong and heating well after 7 months.</li>
    <li> Have used my HGL1R 4 Times already so far works good ,could be a little hotter.I just used it with saving cream not gel. The reviews say the Gel doesn&#x27;t get as hot,I will check that out later. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Heats up slow. Not that hot even on hi temp works about as good as holding can under hot water for the same amount of time. Save your money and upgrade</li>
    <li> A warmly received gift (see what I did there?) by a man who really values a great shave. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews on this product before I purchased it, I knew that it may be messy setting it up. So, I set it up for my husband before hand (to alleviate it being thrown out a window). It was messy, but once you get the top on straight...it was wonderful. My husband loves it. It doesn&#x27;t keep the gel hot for very long but my husband said the feel of the shave when your done makes up for it. When the gel can runs out...we will try the shaving cream to see if that stays warm longer. Also I am going to try to find a washer (like another reviewer suggested) to try and keep the shaving cream from spraying out when you first hook it up. Maybe the company can actually do this when they are making new ones.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations.  The lather did not get hot or even as warm as room temperature.  Would not recommend this model.  I did, however, find a Conair model that got hot and bought it and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This hot lather machine works very well. I love a warm shave. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have only tried the Lather Shaveing Cream and lt&#x27;s Good and Hot.</li>
    <li> hot lather. Would prefer that the Off button actually turns the thing off, it appears to just put it in standby. I unplug it for safety reasons, but it does heat lather quickly.</li>
    <li> Directions did not show how to operate machine.  Took it to Woodbridge, they did not know to operate it as well.  With a little patience we finally got it to work when we arrived home.  You would think Conair would employ people with some knowledge of how their appliances operate.  It took at least fifty minutes to get to Conair and an hour waiting time to get no results. Also Amazon doesn&#x27;t mention the exchange in Canadian funds when ordering.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long. About three months and it became junk. Kept clogging up and then stopped heating. I had a different brand before this and lasted over five years with out any problems.</li>
    <li> doesnt get very hot and lather comes out very slow</li>
    <li> Not very good quality.  Have had a hard time using gels with this.  The cans don&#x27;t hook up very well and just makes a mess.  Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, just warm.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The Conair lather heating machine is the perfect machine for a man who shaves everyday. It produces the perfect warm lather to assist in getting a close shave. The device has a small footprint on my bathroom counter. The best feature is that I can use my own brand of shaving cream. It was an excellent price too.</li>
    <li> works great. Husband loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it :)</li>
    <li> It seemed to use way more product that normal and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  It was a gift so I was pretty disappointed to hear it didn&#x27;t workout .</li>
    <li> I have to say, I have ordered A LOT from Amazon and have always been happy. However, I thought it was very tacky when my $30 Lather Heating System came in AS A FATHER&#x27;S DAY GIFT with a HUGE bright yellow sticker across the front of the box that said &amp;#34;CLEARANCE $9.99&amp;#34;. I spent the better part of an hour trying to get that stupid sticker off, angry the whole time that I had overpaid by $20 apparently, so that I could wrap this up as a gift. Amazon should reconsider doing business with this seller. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cream should come out hot not luke warm.</li>
    <li> This warms shaving cream. It is warm. It doesn&#x27;t make it super hot. They probably can&#x27;t make it heat up very hot to avoid any possible liability if it got too hot.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Not bad for the price!</li>
    <li> Great purchase. I work in a barbershop and it works just fine for me. Good product!</li>
    <li> Does not heat the shaving cream as well as my old one. Only Luke warm.</li>
    <li> This product works well, until you  drop it.  So this is my second one i have ordered for my barbershop.  I recommend it if you  like warm lather to shave with.</li>
    <li> My husband ran out of it and used a different brand and it was a huge mess, back to &amp;#34;Barbasol&amp;#34; and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> After a week of not shaving it is a pleasure to shave on a Saturday morning.</li>
    <li> Not bad I had some issues trying to get the can on and stop the flow but now I think I figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine in my barber shop........we will see how it hold up.</li>
    <li> What a headache...the product leaked ALL over the place the whole time.  Don&#x27;t believe any of the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> This hot lather system works great. It&#x27;s nice to shave with a hot lather. I get a much closer shave with it.</li>
    <li> Have used this item several times since purchasing and it works great.  Lather is very warm coming out of machine.  Very good price.  Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the information to purchase Barbasol shaving cream, this item works well.  My husband had been using another shaving cream and it did not work.  It was mentioned in one of the reviews that Barbasol worked and it does!</li>
    <li> Great deal, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The wife is the one that uses it and she seems to like.</li>
    <li> Does no warm lather enough</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! Most warmers don&#x27;t work for gels but this one does. He does say that the gel isn&#x27;t as warm as he&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s way better than a cold shave!</li>
    <li> Not worth the effort.  Doesn&#x27;t get very hot and by the time you get it on your face and start to shave it has cooled down.  Not the easiest thing to load and using the provided &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; to take the cap of the new can is a bit of work.  Would not order again.</li>
    <li> Recieved my newConair  today.  I have had 3 different Conair lather machines in the last 25 years. In fact I had this model for 8 years, it just quit.  I opened  this one up and hooked it up and turned it on. The lather heated up in a few minutes and is just as hot as my old machine I am very happy with this same machine, in fact I will order a second One to keep in the pantry as a spare.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Messy and does not heat up very well. Drips too.  AVOID THIS!!!</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this lather heating system.  He used to would only shave when necessary and how he shaves very regularly.</li>
    <li> Works great, never have to do another cold shave, much cleaner shave and much less irritation, I have to shave everyday so it&#x27;s a big help</li>
    <li> this product works great, i like the hot lather on my face, easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my man and he loves it. He&#x27;s bald and shaves his head as well as his face and this makes shaving feel luxurious.  Plus, it keeps razor burn away! The only drawback is he was previously using Nivea shave gel but their gel can is designed weird and doesn&#x27;t work with the warmer. Worth the switch though.</li>
    <li> I got one of these as a gift years ago, but it looks identical to this one. Its a good unit, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.  I&#x27;ve only used the gel nozzle, so my comments are about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather could be hotter, but it&#x27;s still way better than cold lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could heat up faster, but if I turn it on when I first go in to shave by the time I get the sink full of hot water and use a hot washcloth to soak my whiskers the lather is hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times you assemble it it seems tricky, but after that you won&#x27;t need the instructions.  A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you put the can in make sure the \\&quot;control cap\\&quot; (the big black button) is unlocked and up (that&#x27;s what controls the flow of the gel), and that the nozzle is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you put the can in but before you put the cover on, set the unit upright and push down on the unit to make sure it is seated. Then, push the control cap down and slide the lock over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use it if you don&#x27;t get much foam out of the nozzle, check that the control cap is still down and locked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it leak between the cap and the nozzle a couple of times, but I fixed that.  The gel nozzle has a groove that looks like it is supposed to have an o-ring, but there wasn&#x27;t one in it (the foam nozzle doesn&#x27;t have the groove).  I didn&#x27;t have an o-ring that size, but I did have a thin (maybe 1/16\\&quot;) rubber washer I was able to trim to fit inside the unit (not in the nozzle&#x27;s o-ring groove).  The nozzle is now tight, and it hasn&#x27;t leaked anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like mine well enough that if it ever breaks I&#x27;ll get another.</li>
    <li> This product only lasted a few months.  Never really heated up the lather, luke-warm at best.  I&#x27;ve thrown it away and gone back to brush and soap stone.</li>
    <li> Terrible product never even gets war let alone hot. Very disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> Cumbersome, hard to load; have to find the right size can, which is a problem; my husband hates this product; ordered it as a Christmas gift; wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Does not work with Nivea shaving cream, which is my favorite. Unfortunate. It&#x27;s now sitting in a drawer unused.</li>
    <li> I am simply delighted with this - using lather - Nivea For Men Extra Moisture Shaving Foam, 8.7 oz. You simply pull entire plastic top off of shaving foam can (the little screwdriver tool with it really is not needed) - then the can seats easily - this one fits into the Conair base also. Heats in 2 minutes or less - wonderfully warm - have the temperature set about 3/4 of the way up. I just dispense lather into my hand and use a shaving brush rinsed in hot water to apply. I also use an old fashioned double edged razor - blades seem to be lasting longer also. Simply makes shaving a joy. I had to mail order the shaving foam - seems hard to find otherwise. Pays to check several places for prices - try a Google search. Anyway, simply delighted.</li>
    <li> Husband love it. It works great with all cans of creams and gels but it quit working. Didn&#x27;t last a year. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had it for a few weeks and I love it.  It was a replacement for an old Conair that I had a few years ago this one is an upgraded version and I really like it.  There is something about a bit of warm lather lol</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair HGL1R for my husband to replace a Conair hot lather machine that no longer works.  The previous machine worked like a champ for years, but is no longer available. The lather is hot, but this machine requires removal of the sleeve that goes over the canned lather to get enough lather to come out for a shave. It&#x27;s not operator problems as my husband is very handy.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to find another hot lather machine to replace this inferior one, so will keep looking for now.  At least he can have a good shave if he takes the sleeve off.  If it didn&#x27;t matter to you, you could leave the sleeve off, but then it&#x27;s ugly and not cool looking.</li>
    <li> It works well, I&#x27;m just to lazy to wait on it. Takes about 5 mins to warm up.  I never use it and you get the same close shave with warm water and cold lather.. So for me it was a bust.</li>
    <li> Foam leaks out on top and seeps threw openings foam warm hate wiping it each time not sure why it leaks shaving cream</li>
    <li> There alright for the price</li>
    <li> this little machine works better than expected i use it everyday</li>
    <li> My expectations were low after reading reviews of this product.  However, my experience (for 2 weeks) has been great.  It heats up the cream or gel while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.  It&#x27;s very hot.  What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> husband uses this most every day and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;the only annoying thing is that not every can of shaving cream fits, and we&#x27;ve had to return a few of them now because we thought they fit and they didn&#x27;t. But he likes this thing so much he now refuses to shave without it. it even bums him out when we travel and he doesn&#x27;t take it with him</li>
    <li> If you use this with shaving cream it works very nicely. If you use it with gel it&#x27;s useless. End of story.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SAID IT&#x27;S GREAT!!! HE LOVES TO GET A HOT SHAVE AT THE BARBER SHOP. I&#x27;M GLAD I GOT IT FOR HIM.</li>
    <li> An absolute disaster. Refused to believe the reviews I read prior to purchase to my chagrin.  Not one iota of heat no matter how long it is plugged in.  The only good point is that it makes an attractive holder for the shave cream.  Shame on you Amazon for continuing to market a poor product.</li>
    <li> Item as described, as others has stated lather just not hot enough.</li>
    <li> This is our second one.  Even at the highest setting, the lather is only a bit above room temperature at the highest setting, but the more significant problem is the difficulty in dispensing the lather from the machine.  We&#x27;ve tried different shaving lathers, but they all require a lot of pressure, and way-too-long for an adequate amount of lather to be dispensed.</li>
    <li> works great .shipped on time.thank you.</li>
    <li> could be a little hotter</li>
    <li> It&#x27;sa good product.  Buy it !</li>
    <li> It worked great...for about 6 months then it stopped dispensing shaving cream.  It heats up but when you try to dispense the shaving cream nothing happens.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and he loves it. The cream gets hot and soothing for a wonderful shave.</li>
    <li> It works great but major deal to keep getting it out in the morning to use. I went to a spa and they had something similar,it works exactly like that.</li>
    <li> It is a lather heating system, but it DOESN&#x27;T get the lather hot!!!! For this kind of money the results should be far better!!!!</li>
    <li> christmas present ,  nice design</li>
    <li> Works, but is a bit uneven.  You must learn to let the first little bit just hit the sink...it is nuclear-hot.  After that bit the rest is a perfect temp for shaving.  Nice to have that warm lather feeling every morning and not just when you get out to the fancy barbershop.</li>
    <li> doesnt get hot enough and is hard to put new can into..i dont like your product...waste of money to me...</li>
    <li> The shipping box was in excellant condition, but the product box looked like it had gone through the mill. The heater had all the parts and did appear to be unused. Since it was a birthday gift I would have like the packaging to be in better condition.</li>
    <li> Barely warmed the lather. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He says gels do not heat as well as the regular (cream) shaving cream.  Otherwise after more than a year&#x27;s use, it is still heating well.</li>
    <li> I tried this initially with Edge shaving gel.  The gel comes out foamy and warm, but cools very quickly.  After much research, I realized that it is worth going to traditional shaving brushes and lather.  It is much better for your skin, like a mini-facial each day.  There are scuttle cups designed to keep the brush and lather warm too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for christmas, he had some trouble getting his can in there and the cap of his can off but he seems pretty happy with it. Although he uses gel he uses it on the lather setting because it is much warmer. I had shopped awhile and read all the reviews of each one complaining they didn&#x27;t get warm enough. As for this one I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s hot but it is nice and warm. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one over all the others and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This unit I received did not work nearly as well as the previous older &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; version.  The lather is barely warm and only of slightly better&lt;br /&gt;consistency than having no heat at all.  The price was right but I would really look for something that works better for a little more money.</li>
    <li> Lather does not get very warm at all.</li>
    <li> You have to love the hot lather machine!!</li>
    <li> Great product and service. Product arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> bought this product and the gel shaving cream heats up ok however; the gel flow out of the nozzle and at the seam where the nozzle connects.  All in All the product does heat up the shaving cream however it is very messy.  I would not recommend this product due to the fact it waste shaving gel and makes a mess even when you are done shaving the gel oozes out through the nozzle where it connects to the body of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> it don not work foam not come out itried many times i finally threw it out</li>
    <li> Works pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!! Doesn&#x27;t last long before it fails.</li>
    <li> The product does not work well. I put both cap on gel, for gel and foam for foam. the product discharged two cans of shave cream, in five minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a xmas present for my husband. After I got it all put together, the lather just kept coming out and when I pushed the stop button nothing happened. I tried unplugging it and the lather kept coming.  A whole can of lather was wasted on this product!!! What a shame.  My husband was really looking forward to receiving one of these for xmas</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly pleased with this purchase. It was pretty easy to set up and reliably heats up the gel. I guess my main complaint is that the gel doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as I would like and only stays warm for about 10 seconds. Could be the gel that&#x27;s the problem. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I I am a full-time barber. Just opened up my own shop so my budget is tight. For the price, this product works very well. It&#x27;s not as difficult to install as some of the reviews say. It&#x27;s actually very basic just follow the instructions. The first can I put it on did not ooze out the shaving cream too well. So I tried a different can of the same standard shaving cream, and it works great. I use it multiple times a day so about 5 minutes before I finish my customer&#x27;s haircut I press the on button again to make sure the shaving cream is warm. Then I will do the back of the neck shave with my straight edge razor with the warm lather. Have gotten compliments on the feelof the warm lather. This is not as high end as an actual shave cream lather machine in a barbershop, but like I said for the price it&#x27;s very good. Lather machines will run you like $200. I got this for about $26. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently sent this back. I think if I rubbed my hands together with shaving lather it would get warmer than this machine. The temperature is luke warm at best at the highest setting. The box looked like it was returned and looked used. The fittings do not support different gel can tops.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews here I was a bit concerned with this purchase but, decided to give it a chance.  After reading the instructions twice and practicing with an old emptied can I was confident that I would not make a mess of it.  Luckily I was right it was easier than I thought.  If you have an almost empty can I suggest you practice the set up with that first before attempting a new full can of foam.  The instructions reads that if set too hot the foam will come out as a liquid so I started with it set in the middle.  NICE and WARM.  Perfect!  The first shave I dispensed the foam on my hand and applied it to my face, that was nice but I felt like I was wasting a lot since I had to rinse my hand of the extra before using my razor.  The second shave I decided to dispense it on my brush and brush it on.  I was able to get 3 shaving passes before I ran out of foam on the brush.  Seems like less waste and I like the way the brush applies the foam to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to everyone who loves a warm foam for shaving.</li>
    <li> Works great . Be sure to turn temperature knob a full turn clockwise for maximum temperature setting</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Conair hot lather machine on clearance at a major discount store about 5 years ago.  I figured, what the heck, at this price what have I got to lose?  The original machine has performed admirably, and I got way more value for my dollar than I had hoped.  But, as things will, the original machine finally gave out.  I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in stores but I did find one online.  I paid full price this time, but if the performance is anything near what it was for the previous one, I will still get my money&#x27;s worth and more to boot.  Privides the smoothest, most comfortable shave yet.  I&#x27;ve had the new unit for about three months and so far it has performed even better than the original.  At this rate it will easily have paid for itself many times over by the time it wears out.  I only hope Conair still makes them by then so I will be able to get a third unit!</li>
    <li> I like the product and it sets up a good shave.  It doesn&#x27;t use up the whole can of shaving cream,but that is a small mater.</li>
    <li> The hot lather machine by Conair works GREAT! It has two problems. The ready light needs[[ASIN:B000BD4T94 Conair HGL1 Combination Hot Gel/Lather Machine, Black]] to be moved up so you do not have to put your face over it to see if it has quit blinking. Also the heater needs to be enlarged as it takes a long time to heat the lather if you use a high heat setting.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and we hated it the minute we opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to use several times, however, it was a piece of trash so we threw it away</li>
    <li> I like the idea and liked it when it worked, but stopped working far too quickly.</li>
    <li> After the first few uses, it stopped dispensing the shaving cream and my husband threw it away, after a few profound words about it.  Unfortunately, I had thrown the box away by that time and so we didn&#x27;t even attempt to send it back.</li>
    <li> It works only till you use half of the container then no more foam. It dies warm the gel fine but then you have to take it off if you want to use the rest of your gel</li>
    <li> The lather doesn&#x27;t heat up as hot as I had hoped it would. It&#x27;s not bad but it isn&#x27;t great either.</li>
    <li> Working well so far.  Light on top is very small to see the red light.</li>
    <li> Much like the other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. At the highest setting it comes out warm, but by the time you lather up your face its pretty much luke warm to room temp. Not quite as nice as the barber&#x27;s hot lather machine, but still nicer than straight out of the can. The lather comes out a little thinner and goes on easier, and it still feels like a closer shaver, so it&#x27;s not a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Many complain it stops working after a time.  Keep the nozzle clean and make sure to shake the can before use.</li>
    <li> dose not heat the lather that much looks hot when it first comes out see steam but lather is still cold. It would get hotter if i left the can out and it was 90 out side might even get hotter if it was 70. hot it dose not get. this is a piece of  junk .</li>
    <li> Hot shaving gel/cream is the way to go for a great shave like the barbers used to offer.</li>
    <li> for gel the max heat really isnt all that warm</li>
    <li> My husband enjoyed it until it broke one day while he was twisting the cap back on. Delivery and condition was good but the product material is really cheap and can easily break if not handle with gently.</li>
    <li> work ok the only thing dont like the gel is not hot enought..</li>
    <li> Lather is only warm , No where Near hot! Very disappointing&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> It would be nice if it got the lather a little warmer.</li>
    <li> The lather is warmed fairly well. I would like it to be a little warmer. Even when set at the highest setting, the gel doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I guess I have to spend a little more than $30 to get a better product. Everything else works great. Easy setup, good lather flow, and quick heating.</li>
    <li> This product was great because it was easy to use and it seemed durable.  The product also had good instructions that anyone could follow.</li>
    <li> The Conair is a good product which easily and rapidly heats the shave cream for use.  The downside is the valve to activate the flow is not easy to manipulate and requires significant pressure to do so.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat the foam as well as the 10 year old model that I had.  Definitely a step backwards even after days of adjustments and tweaks.</li>
    <li> this product does exactly what it says and the lather comes out steaming hot.  very pleased with this purchase.  : )</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it. It was pretty easy to assemble and the product does as it describes. Comes out for a nice hot shave. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good machine.  Lather gets warm but not Hot.</li>
    <li> Just like my other Conair after 5+ years. Really works well with gel. Seems to save the amount of gel needed.</li>
    <li> It is a little more complicted to operate than the original. The instructions don&#x27;t say this, but if you turn it on, give it a good shake and then leave it to heat up fo a few minutes you will find you get a better result.&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT using GEL so cannot comment on how it might work with that.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  This was to be a birthday gift for someone.  First I was very concerned that this product cost $88.99 before shipping, but since I had trouble finding any other hot lather machines to purchase, I thought it was worth a try.  When it arrived, the unit did not work at all when plugged in, and the black plastic cylinder looked cheap so I had to return it.  That was a good thing since I was able to find a new Conair silver bodied hot lather system that works great and looks much better for less than half the price I paid for this one.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy the Conair Gel &amp; lather. This is the second one he has purchased.</li>
    <li> This does what it is supposed to do. However, it took me a few days to know that.&lt;br /&gt;I am using a lather, not a gel. I eased up to the right temperature setting, so the lather was not very warm the first couple of days. Then I got it too hot once. Now I have it dialed in at about as hot as I want it to be when it hits my hand.&lt;br /&gt;This can fits snugly into the top of the Conair, leaving no doubt about staying put. The first can I tried was a gel that was almost empty. Two or three tries to install the can into the Conair were not successful.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said the lather does not stay hot. That is true, but not the fault of Conair. I don&#x27;t expect them to modify the laws of physics. Moisture evaporates rapidly from hot lather, cooling it. I prep my beard with hot water in a wash cloth before applying lather.&lt;br /&gt;Another feature that takes a few minutes to understand is the difference between how Conair handles gel versus lather. Lather is dispensed into and through the head after the head is hot. Gel is dispensed into the head continually and stays there until it is heated when the Conair is turned on. It is released into your hand by a button near the end of the spout after the Conair comes up to temperature. The disk-shaped control center on top is pressed down to release lather. It is clamped and stays down when you use gel.&lt;br /&gt;I get a closer, more comfortable shave using hot lather, but the difference is not great. My shave with gel straight from the can is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;For me, $20 was not a great risk. I figured I could return it if it did not work out (I like Amazon prime). I am keeping and using it and would buy another.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Great product, use it every day!</li>
    <li> Really make shaving more enjoyable if that is possible.  Especially since it is winter now and warm makes all things easier.</li>
    <li> Tried this product twice @ND it stopped pumping out the lather both times. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> This is the third, and last, time I will purchase this thing.  The first two lasted about 2-months and stopped working.  The third one I never did get the damn thing to work.  I returned it and  will look elsewhere for a replacement.  It is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected</li>
    <li> Got it for my Dad and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Great idea!! Unfortunately it was super messing and left a smell of burning shaving cream in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this...... Have used it maybe four days now. Decided to use it with some Shick gel shave cream I already had in the house, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work so well, with regard to dispensing from this container. It does slightly heat the shave gel, but it seems to take forever to get enough shave cream to use for shaving.  I am curious to find out if any other users have found a better brand more suited towards use in this dispenser.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised. I would buy another one if this one should ever quit working.</li>
    <li> The husband loved. It took a little longer to get here than I had expected, but it was over the holidays.</li>
    <li> so disappointed, these machines do not heat up at all, sent me 2 an neither works!!!</li>
    <li> Cream does not come out hot or even warm, I&#x27;d describe it more as sort of not cold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best lather machine I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> crap.  it does not get hot.  maybe a mild warm, almost like tap water warm, but not any better for shaving than right out of the can.</li>
