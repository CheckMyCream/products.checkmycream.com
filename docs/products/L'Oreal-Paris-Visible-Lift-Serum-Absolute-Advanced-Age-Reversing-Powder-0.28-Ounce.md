      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this shade in retail stores but Amazon has it and great price too.</li>
      <li>but I have found that I can wear this product over my foundation and it looks great.</li>
      <li>They fit perfectly where the brush is.  </li>
      <li>This &#x27;seals&#x27; in the wetter concealer for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>This is a great powder, it covers really well for a powder and my skin looks flawless and pore-less after I use it!</li>
      <li>I love this makeup!  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t that thrilled with this product</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this</li>
      <li>but this happens to be one of my favorite.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
      <li>Great coverage, works great with other concealers to cover tattoos if needed.</li>
      <li>You know that those facial tatts might not be a good idea when meeting the Queen of England.</li>
      <li>It came early which was nice.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t available in any of my local stores anymore, so I&#x27;m thankful to be able to purchase it on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I do use a little of a primer powder before applying, to help keep my uber-oily &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; tamed the best as possible, and then I finish with a couple swipes of a bronzer to liven up my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>It has the little brush and mirror in a compartment underneath, so that is good.  </li>
      <li>If your skin tone varies from season to season as mine does get one of each, since the price is so reasonable !</li>
      <li>I get nice and tan in the summer and pretty pale in the winter but with olive undertones.</li>
      <li>Really works well on making skin completely even in tones with a smooth and natural finish.  </li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this powder</li>
      <li>The deep is good right now because I still have a little bit of a tan</li>
      <li>Older women they say, are not supposed to wear powder</li>
      <li>I would suggest ordering one shade up from what you would normally get.</li>
      <li>i just bought this and 3 other loreal face products from cvs tonight and this is going right back for a refund the other three loreal face products i loved all matched me</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have said the colors do run light .</li>
      <li>It fulfills my need for solid powder and a mirror and a powder puff at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>did anyone even try using the bizarre case, where you have to flip to one side to access the powder, and then flip the center closed to get to the mirror in the bottom?</li>
      <li>I think if you are super pale white this powder will work for you</li>
      <li>i think this is terrific light airy  not to thick very fluffy on face with a very even covereage applied with brush not pad</li>

<li> The powder itself - which I find inferior to previous products - is pretty much unusable, because it&#x27;s so hard to even get to it.</li>
<li> but this one is like i dip my brush in baby powder and ran it across me face and its the same color as the other products all tan/or meduim its the stangest weirdest looking make up finish i have ever seen in my 43 years</li>
<li> The medium dark looks so white on my face</li>
<li> i t seems to be same coverage as my previous  match face powder</li>
<li> but when you put it on it dulls you to ashes</li>
<li> I have been a big fan of L&#x27;oreal powder products in the past, so while I wondered about the changed case, I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I can still get some of the other versions in a usable case with sponge applicator, because this one is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal</li>
<li> I have the other shades and use them often</li>
<li> but I also just ordered the medium shade for the dead of winter.</li>
<li> I bought Victoria Vogue Round Puff Pressed powder</li>
<li> Any other powder/mineral makeup I&#x27;ve used just disappears halfway through the day, and/or settles into creases/pores, which is appalling.  </li>
<li> 4 small to use with it as I am used to a powder puff.  </li>
<li> Worst beauty purchase ever:(</li>
<li> HATE all of it!</li>
<li> Of all the powders I have tried, this is the worst!</li>
<li> For me, this is one of the worst products ever.</li>

    <li> Wasn&#x27;t that thrilled with this product</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with product and very happy to have found such a great deal.</li>
    <li> (BTW, this post isn&#x27;t from Bruce, but from his wife) I love this makeup!  It isn&#x27;t available in any of my local stores anymore, so I&#x27;m thankful to be able to purchase it on Amazon!  I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts.  Any other powder/mineral makeup I&#x27;ve used just disappears halfway through the day, and/or settles into creases/pores, which is appalling.  This product stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t settle.  I do use a little of a primer powder before applying, to help keep my uber-oily &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; tamed the best as possible, and then I finish with a couple swipes of a bronzer to liven up my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Really works well on making skin completely even in tones with a smooth and natural finish.  Very Satisfied!!!! I like all of Loreal products but this happens to be one of my favorite.</li>
    <li> The color is misleading.  Of all the powders I have tried, this is the worst! The medium dark looks so white on my face it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  I think if you are super pale white this powder will work for you but if you have any hint of color (I am medium in color) it will NOT.  Worst beauty purchase ever:(</li>
    <li> Color is great,it is real medium. I like it very much. When I&#x27;m wearing it my face is softer and tender.</li>
    <li> I really like this powder but I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. L&#x27;Oreal - please don&#x27;t discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, works great with other concealers to cover tattoos if needed. You know that those facial tatts might not be a good idea when meeting the Queen of England. This &#x27;seals&#x27; in the wetter concealer for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this at Target or Rite Aide anymore, so I ordered on Amazon.  Works well with the Visible Lift makeup.  These are products that do what they claim to do.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Couldn&#x27;t find this shade in retail stores but Amazon has it and great price too. Will keep on buying. Thanks</li>
    <li> First application was good but aftee few hours it becomes cakey. :(</li>
    <li> i just bought this and 3 other loreal face products from cvs tonight and this is going right back for a refund the other three loreal face products i loved all matched me but this one is like i dip my brush in baby powder and ran it across me face and its the same color as the other products all tan/or meduim its the stangest weirdest looking make up finish i have ever seen in my 43 years i can hold the compact up againtest my face and color matchs but when you put it on it dulls you to ashes</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and love it. I have the other shades and use them often</li>
    <li> This is a great powder, it covers really well for a powder and my skin looks flawless and pore-less after I use it! Also it&#x27;s non toxic! I decided to try it because I always check the environmental working group&#x27;s Skin Deep website for non toxic cosmetics and personal care products and this had a score of 1 out of a possible 10 ! You also can&#x27;t beat the price! As other reviewers have said the colors do run light . I ordered the deep color and I&#x27;m a medium olive complexion. I get nice and tan in the summer and pretty pale in the winter but with olive undertones. The deep is good right now because I still have a little bit of a tan but I also just ordered the medium shade for the dead of winter. I would suggest ordering one shade up from what you would normally get. If your skin tone varies from season to season as mine does get one of each, since the price is so reasonable ! I&#x27;m so glad I found this I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it! If you are very fair there&#x27;s a listing on here for two compacts for $5! Wish they had the darker colors at this price !</li>
    <li> It came early which was nice.  It has the little brush and mirror in a compartment underneath, so that is good.  It is a nice size and I like the color.  I bought Victoria Vogue Round Puff Pressed powder 4 small to use with it as I am used to a powder puff.  They fit perfectly where the brush is.  It fulfills my need for solid powder and a mirror and a powder puff at a reasonable price.</li>

Going back and forth is a total pain, and the brush applicator is no improvement either. The powder itself - which I find inferior to previous products - is pretty much unusable, because it&#x27;s so hard to even get to it. For me, this is one of the worst products ever. Just grateful I can still get some of the other versions in a usable case with sponge applicator, because this one is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal, please go back to a case that makes sense!!</li>
