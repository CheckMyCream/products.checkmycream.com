<li> In fact I am told that it is almost too subtle.</li>
<li> Totally disappointed after paying almost 80 dollars for Jayz Gold EDT what I got was an after shave.</li>

    <li> Delived on time, i love the product.</li>
    <li> Just a warning and heads up. This is Aftershave, not Eau De Toilette Spray. I love the Eau De Toilette Spray, and this is very deceptive. They advertise Eau De Toilette Spray, but both the bottle and the box are aftershave (which is much weaker scent and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long).</li>
    <li> He smells sooo good!!!! Father&#x27;s Day gift for my guy.</li>
    <li> This Cologne is a Great Smelling Product and want more</li>
    <li> my hubby loves Jay-z San what better gift to give him for our anniversary than this? Smells amazing and came in excellent timing.. Would definitely buy this cologne again!</li>
    <li> Got 3 oz for just about price of 2 ounces! Great buy !</li>
    <li> It is amazing ! I&#x27;m getting the ladies</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne not even close to being loud or overwhelming. In fact I am told that it is almost too subtle. Do not believe the negative reviews, get a sample at Macy&#x27;s and try it before you dismiss it or take my word for it.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! And this price cant be beat, even at &amp;#34;discounted fragrance&amp;#34; sites. Would def buy again!</li>
    <li> Great...fast shipping.....awesome smell!!</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed after paying almost 80 dollars for Jayz Gold EDT what I got was an after shave. Unfortunately I did not check it very well before travelling out of the US cos I got it 2 days before my trip back to Africa and was excited I was gonna use it afterwards, however when I decided to use it I discovered that it was an aftershave. Now how to I get to try the EDT when the aftershave was mistakenly sent to me? And im all the way in Africa.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my husband!!</li>
    <li> Smells great- always getting complimented on :)</li>
