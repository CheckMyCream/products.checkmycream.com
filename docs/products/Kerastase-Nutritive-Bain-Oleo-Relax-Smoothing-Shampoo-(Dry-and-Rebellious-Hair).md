    <li> My hair is curly and tends to be frizzy. This shampoo helps to keep it under control. Buying it in a large size, as I did, proves to be less expensive in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a LOT of shampoos, and until this one, I never really thought a shampoo could make a big difference in my hair.  This product is fantastic.  My hair is thick and coarse and I blow dry it straight.  If I could just pair this product with a great hair dryer, my life would be a lot easier.  I still use pureology hydrate conditioner and love that, too.</li>
    <li> This review is for the seller, not the product. I have been using this shampoo for years and it is a miracle worker. I have always purchased it from my salon but when I saw this price I had to go for it. The product I received sold by beautylime and shipped by amazon was either watered down or not authentic. I&#x27;m assuming the other negative reviews on this listing were first time users and had nothing to compare it to. The authentic Kerastase product truly is wonderful and this price is unfortunately too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and use it everyday!  I use this large bottle to refill my regular size bottle.  I will purchase this again as it is the only shampoo that makes my hair manageable, and lustrous, without drying it out.  When I color my hair, I use the Kerastase Bain Oleo Relax shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels and looks healthy and shines.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.  Makes for more manageable hair.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair and hadn&#x27;t found a product I liked until I went to Canyon Ranch and they used this shampoo on my hair.  It keeps my hair soft, shiny and no more frizzies. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and I love it.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Nordstrom sells 8.5 oz of this for $33! This purchase is a no-brainer. The only shampoo I&#x27;ll ever use because (as advertised) it leaves my curly hair soft, moisturized and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have used Kerastase products for quite some time, but finally decided to use the larger container since I don&#x27;t plan on changing my shampoo.  What a fantasic idea of purchasing the larger container.  Hopefully, this will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Great for unrelaxed/natural black/ethnic hair, it tames fizziness.  I love it.  It&#x27;s great. I have been using this for 2 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the hair with the treatment</li>
    <li> I love all Kerastase products and this shampoo works well for my very thick wavy course hair.  I always buy the giant size and it lasts a good long while.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat purchaser of this shampoo. It leaves a slightly slick feeling in my hair which I really like. I have very curly, dry hair that loves this shampoo. I tried the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; regimen for a while but I had to come back to my Kerastase Bain Oleo Relax. Also, I love the scent, which is super important to me.</li>
    <li> I use all time this hair cleaner because this works very well, left my hair soft, gives hydration, and bright. I recommended it to everybody. But the product sended by Beauty isn&#x27;t the original of the brand, this product arrived watered down. This was so bad experience with this store.</li>
    <li> The best hair care product ever made. I have a very light blonde hair and my hair is very fragile because of bleach. However, this shampoo and other products from this company makes my hair soft and silky. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I must confess I found it very expensive at first. But my wife is very satisfied with the results. If she is happy, then I&#x27;m happy too. You know what I mean, right? :-)</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s health to hair.</li>
    <li> I Love Kerastase Products!  They leave my hair so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have ruly , sort of wavy hair.  When I use this product, it leaves my&lt;br /&gt;hair soft and manageable  Also, smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Awesome product for any wavy, curly and rebellious hair. My hair is dry at the ends and it&#x27;s kind of wavy. When I use Kerastase it changes the appearance of my hair, and helps my style !</li>
