<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just received the product and I really like it.  I&#x27;ve already put all my make up into it and everything fits wonderfully with room to spare, which is great considering I had it in two different containers to begin with.  The reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because when I took it out of the box it was missing a foot.  I was hoping it was in the box somewhere so i could fix it, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it so it was shipped broken.  I also tried the key to lock the container and had no luck but I have no need to lock it so it wasn&#x27;t a deal-breaker.  All and all I think this container is in sturdy shape and I would buy it again, it seems very reliable and it came with plenty of dividers which I thought was great because I love to compartmentalize.</li>
    <li> I bout this for my girl friend. I thought it would hold all her fingernail polish and stuff. She use to keep it a big basket all mixed up. She loves this thing it works great. My friend that does tattoos saw it the other day and is ordering one for his stuff now.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s huge and you can take apart the compartments or adjust them which makes it really helpful! I can&#x27;t believe the compartment on the bottom if big enough to fit my professional brushes and even more! :D Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Just too hard to use.  I had to send it back.  It closes up nicely but it is really hard to get anything out of this case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge.  I never would have bought a makeup case this large, but it&#x27;s the perfect size for my somewhere in between low-maintenance and high-maintenance needs.</li>
    <li> I agonized over the decision to buy this case or not.  I&#x27;m really glad I did!  I watched 50-75  YouTube videos of people showing me what was in their train case (no exaggeration) just trying to catch a glimpse of the construction of the different cases available.  I really didn&#x27;t care about which new shimmery lip gloss they just got from smashbox, or how they just maxed out their Capital One Student MasterCard with the $300 limit at the grand opening of Ulta in their Podunk town.  No one wanted to show me the actual case!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a shot since I am an Amazon Prime devotee, and they&#x27;ve been good to me in the past on the rare occasion I needed to return something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be the first to report that this is a solid case!  I&#x27;m new to all of this girly tribal face paint stuff, so forgive me if I don&#x27;t know all of the technical terms.  I will now list the important stuff that everyone like me who spends an average of 9 hours trying to decide which rectangular box to put her newly acquired goodies and dry wall knife applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly: the whole box is aluminum, unlike the crappy caboodles I saw at Target and Ulta that greeted me with cardboard sides caving in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second most importantly:  The expandable shelf thingies are not the least bit wobbly AND they come with removable/adjustable dividers.  I will not lie and tell you that trying to remove these dividers from the second row of shelf thingies is an easy task.  In fact I will throw out the &amp;#34;try this at your own risk&amp;#34; disclaimer.  It&#x27;s a bit of a challenge, but with patience and prayer I was able to succeed without tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth must importantly (uhh, I mean third):  these shelf thingies are durable plastic, so they won&#x27;t get ruined when you spill your war paint (though you may need q-tips and an hour or so of free time to get into all off the crevices).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to fourth most importantly:  the bottom compartment thingie is HUGE!  It also has dividers, which can be removed with more prayer.  I removed the longest one and keep my palettes on one side and all of the free samples I manage to acquire from Sephora and Origins on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OOPS!  There I go telling you what&#x27;s in my train case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress.  Take it from one 34 year old mother who had no business staying up ALL NIGHT researching the train case truth for you (and a little for me) and calling into work the next day because she&#x27;s not as resilient as she used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go forth and buy with confidence!GE!

    <li> Quality product. Bought this for my mother in law for Xmas.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so big, its perfect for all my lipstick!</li>
    <li> A lot bigger than I expected. This is very sturdy and I was very impressed with I received it. I got it on lightning deal at a great price ($24.99) and I was a steal in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Just about everything I have ever ordered from Amazon has been great, no complaints/issue. Unfortunately, the Shany was a big disappointment. It was all plastic inside, which didn&#x27;t seem that way in the pictures. The chrome hardware looked worn/stained, and everytime you opened/closed the case it would make this ugly squeeking noise, and the construction was not very sturdy/strong. It looked and sounded &amp;#34;rickety&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m sorry this purchase didn&#x27;t work out because the size would have been &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These things are entirely too expensive.  Weird dividers provided for lower level that won&#x27;t stay with anything large put in there and there are no instructions or even a diagram with the unit to make sure you&#x27;re setting it up right.  Low quality and will likely break easily in a short time.  No way would I fill it with heavy products and carry it by the handle or armstrap.  These things are just way overpriced for what they are.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old make up case wasn&#x27;t big enough. It holds most of the stuff that I use often but there&#x27;s still some that doesn&#x27;t fit. The trays in the top part of the case that are attached to the top were a little stiff the first few times I opened it, but opens perfectly now! Good make up case, nice and sturdy!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my girlfriend and she loves it; its sturdy, spacious and it has a quality feel. The only thing that would make this better is if the little boxes inside could be taken out, but overall my girlfriend has no issues.</li>
    <li> One of the best,great buy for the money</li>
    <li> My girl loves it! Maybe a little small but then again she has a massive make up collection. Sturdy hard case like a fishing box, well made</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!! Came in on time and i can fit my make up, night creams, make up remover, hygiene and brush. Great for when i have to leave home and can fit everything in one. Its big and spacious.</li>
    <li> It looks like it wants to fall apart . But it&#x27;s still holding up</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy at the all. The size was great, but I think this case would not hold up for very long. However, for the price, I decided to give it a try and hope that I&#x27;m wrong about the craftsmanship!</li>
    <li> Fantastic....delivery was fast...love my make up case...</li>
    <li> When I received this case, I was shocked at its size and weight. To begin, it took up half of my 29&amp;#34; Olympia luggage. It was quite heavy for me to lift, and I see this being the only disadvantage going forward as I my muscle tone is not as it should be for a young person. The case is beautiful on the outside, and seems to have a very slight shine to it as displayed in the picture. It seems like a long lasting heavy duty plastic on the outside. The clips on the outside are a little bit flimsy, so take your time to ensure that you pay attention when closing them to preserve its life. The inside seems to be of good quality as well. Lots of room in there. The separators are movable so you can partition the upper channels as you want. The bottom seems to be carpeted neatly with some sort of suede-ish material. It comes with keys for the locks. I should mention that I am not a make up artist, and wont even call myself a makeup enthusiast. I do like makeup, and I have some quality items, but yet it seems like plenty for me, but certainly not enough for a makeup enthusiast. All my things can fit in this case; however it will be to heavy for me to carry around on trips to relatives, worse yet foreign. I wanted a large enough case for easily carrying around all my makeup and for use at home; and although this will be to heavy for me, I am so impressed with it that I must give it 5 stars. Please note before purchase I did read the reviews of this and several other products which said they were to small to fit all your make up; with the exception of this one, hence I went for this one. I guess many of those reviewers who indicated that the other cases were to small were probably makeup professionals or enthusiasts and have more makeup and muscle than me lol. Great case nevertheless.</li>
    <li> Poorly made. Not a true &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; train, lots of cheap plastic trays inside.  I returned it as soon as I got it back. Great for an amateur or someone who&#x27;s starting out. Giving it 2 stars because Amazon is awesome and their return policy rocks!</li>
    <li> Cheap.  Mechanisms do not operate smoothly.  Top and sides do not match up when closing.  Inside compartments are tight and difficult to reach in the bottom.  I can&#x27;t imagine what product the other reviewers received but this Is just a huge disappointment for me.</li>
    <li> i love the amount of space in this train case! the main thing i would choose is how smoothly it opens and closes. it kind of stalls, like it&#x27;s stuck, and i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> Really bad quality...not happy at all. It looks like  a $10.00 dollars not a $50.00 dollars make up box. Did not close properly very cheap made. Just get the Sehora is really good quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what she needed, wish it had more spacers/dividers for the shelves included though.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it! At first she thought it wasn&#x27;t built well because the drawers didn&#x27;t open cleanly but once she put her things in it she was able to get it to work smoothly. It has dividers which is great for making custom compartments. It is really great and she would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This case is much larger than the majority of other makeup cases I have seen. It was was much larger in dimensions than the train case from Sephora and was cheaper. The quality is very good for the price. The only thing that needs to be changed on this model are the drawer hinges. They tend to get a little stuck when the case is opened or closed.</li>
    <li> if there is ever a make-up war, pray you are on the same side of the battlefield as The Pupu, fierce cosmetics overkill warrior.  If Shany Cosmetics made make-up bandoleers, I would have purchased them for The Pupu, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, decent construction, and the tiered shelves actually slide out as you open the cover, but were a little catchy and stiff to slide back together, but if you open and close it a bunch of times, it sort of wears in and gets smoother.  The body is a light metal material.  The handle is plastic, but seems sturdy.  It is lockable, small lock, two keys.  The slide drawers also come with dividers that are re-positionable in the million little slots that are along the walls of those drawers.  The bottom area is a little deeper, permanently divided into 6 spaces and is covered with a soft smooth nice material.  For the price: I like.  I give it 5 stars.  The Pupu gives it 6 stars because she can and you can&#x27;t stop her.</li>
    <li> very nice case. Could have been a little cheaper</li>
    <li> Plastic is very thin and cheaply made. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and bigger than it looks from picture.  Yet it is light weight.  I like the design.  I can see this lasting longer than my other cases that have fallen apart.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because its bigger then some of the other ones you find. It is really huge! it comes with a strap to carry but its so big its kinda awkward having it on your shoulder. i prefer carrying by the handle. I like that the inside isnt made of that cheap cardboard crap the other brands use. also all the compartments are customize able. the bottom piece comes out so i can fit my 120 BH pallete. Its better then all the other ones ive seen but its could be more sturdy but i have never seen one sturdier then this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product is that you can tell it was OLD. There was rust on the silver parts and I bought it because it said it come with a lock on the box and keys, however, the lock barely works (it has it moments) and the keys are tiny, they can be easily lost and damage because they look so cheap</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it does look like the pictures BUT the inside looks horrible.  there is glue all over the edges and just doesn&#x27;t look good.  I bought this for my wife for Christmas and wont be giving it to her</li>
    <li> Good item. Stylish case. Lots of room for all my stuff. I love all the compartments. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last two months, and it is everything that I expected it to be. I highly recommend this Shany makeup train. I was skeptical of its size, but I was pleasantly surprised at the roominess it offers. I am not a makeup artist, but I wanted something that could hold my everyday cosmetics, plus some overflow of things that I don&#x27;t use quite as often. It fits all of my makeup with plenty of room left for a small, expanding collection. The only thing to note that doesn&#x27;t work is the lock, but, like I said, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, so it stays at home. I have a smaller Modella train case that I use for travel. This fits my needs perfectly!</li>
    <li> Holds all my makeup and rubber bands. I love this makeup case!! It&#x27;s so big! If I ever get more makeup it&#x27;ll definently hold all of it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great case, especially at this price point! I did a lot of research and found many reviewers complaining that the second tier wasn&#x27;t adjustable. It totally is, you just have to put the inserts in at an angle to get under the top shelf. The only disappointment I have is that after about a month&#x27;s daily use, the foam liner started separating from the case right along the opening on top. Nothing a bit of glue didn&#x27;t fix. Overall, I love this case and have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> This makeup case is the perfect size, love it. Well made. Im very happy my makeup has the perfect home :)</li>
    <li> I did get my item on time , but when I picked it up item was Damaged so I had to send it back, so I was upset because I was really looking foward on getting it n making use of it</li>
    <li> Medium quality cosmetic organizer. The one one ordered for my girlfriend came broken so that was a disappointment. She&#x27;s a make up artist and said for every day use that this wouldn&#x27;t be a quality case.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this, because of the reviews. When I first opened it, it seemed nice like how it appears in the picture, but when I examined it better I noticed a chunk of it missing in the corner. I saw the cardboard used to make it and it looked very flimsy, I shipped it back the next day.</li>
    <li> It makes organizing small items for conventions/craft shows easy and it makes loading in and out of events simple as the strap/handle make carrying easy.  My only issue is that the strap is mounted low, so if you don&#x27;t think carefully about weight distribution it can make the case flip over which is NOT a good thing if it&#x27;s filled with small glass containers as mine is.</li>
    <li> I love it! I keep my make up, hair accessories,curling iron, etc in here. Great for keeping down in clutter and for jet setter lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Flimsy  The dividers are just card board</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than the photo posted and because of that I like it even better. All of my makeup fits in here and I use this a lot whenever I get the chance to travel. It&#x27;s not that heavy at all.</li>
    <li> Great case and holds all my makeup with room to buy more. Thank you SHANY for such a wonderful and well built train case!!!!</li>
    <li> This makeup case is very big. It has customizable compartments. I removed the dividers in the bottom so I could have a large space to put my shadow pallets. It&#x27;s a much better product and price than anything I&#x27;ve seen in a retail store.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a nice looking Train Case. I found this reasonably priced, and despite the negative reviews I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered quickly, which was great, and I happily opened it up so that I could start organizing my supplies. Immediately I knew that something was amiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, I noticed that the case didn&#x27;t look quite as heavy-duty as it had appeared on Amazon. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a bombproof box, but I didn&#x27;t want something that would fall apart during a trip in a vehicle. However, appearances can be deceiving, and I really didn&#x27;t want to write the case off just due to it&#x27;s look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the lid, and saw that there was white residue all over the inner edge of my black case. I was unable to scrape the residue off with my fingernail, and didn&#x27;t bother with anything else after I noticed the other flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam lining on the box was pulling away in two large areas, and there were other areas where the foam was bubbled out, and you could tell it wouldn&#x27;t last long before it was pulling away too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two issues alone wouldn&#x27;t have made me return it. I could have cleaned it up and re-glued it. But when I tried to shut the box, one of the sides wouldn&#x27;t close. I had to lift the inner boxes up, and then close the lid, in order for it to succesfully close. I did this three times (with the boxes completely empty), to see if this was fixable with worse results each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time I was very disappointed. I ended up returning this case, and getting a more expensive one that I don&#x27;t have to fix or worry about breaking.</li>
    <li> I was iffy on buying this makeup box but I love it. It holds wayyyyy more than i expected it to and looks good as well.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, this is the second time this has happened while purchasing from Amazon. I bought a new case and received it damaged, and covered in makeup. It looked like the seller tried to wipe it down. However, it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was unused the case seemed nice. Very good size. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Very large. Could stand to be a little sturdier, but for the price, it is as expected.  Locks and has a strap for carrying which is good because it holds a lot of items and gets heavy.</li>
    <li> Love love love one of the first things I bought online and I was scared to get it but it is perfect I&#x27;ve used it for two years now do have come back to write a Reveiw it is so freakin good I out my make up jewelry and nail Polish in it and it&#x27;s pretty heavy so it just stays in my room but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s hard to move everywhere it&#x27;s the freakin best</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this case. It got such great reviews, but after thinking about it for a few days, I ended up returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the case that I received was different from the picture on Amazon. I ordered this in black which is pictured as all black, including black accents, but I got a case that was black plastic with a black handle, but with silver trim and silver clasps. Maybe not a big deal for others, but part of the reason I ordered this case was because I thought the black would be more subtle. I didn&#x27;t want it to be too obtrusive sitting out on my table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I should say that I don&#x27;t wear (or have) a lot of make up. The product description says this is &amp;#34;designed for professional makeup artists&amp;#34; so maybe I would like it more if I had more makeup. This box is absolutely HUGE. I saw the size in the description, and measured it out, but there&#x27;s something about seeing it that made it seem even bigger. It takes up way too much space for me, especially when fully open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the case itself, it&#x27;s plastic and aluminum, and felt really cheap. Definitely not what I expected to get after spending over 50 dollars on this thing. Every time I opened or closed the case, it made an almost squeaking sound. I can only imagine what that would sound like after long-term use. And, one of the sides of the lid didn&#x27;t line up with the bottom unless I manually fixed it. I agree with other reviewers who said that it&#x27;s difficult to adjust the slots on the middle and bottom levels because the level above it gets in the way. The good news is it does fit a full hair dryer and straightener, but if you put those in the bottom, you can&#x27;t fit anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m just glad Amazon has such a great return policy.</li>
    <li> This case is made very Cheaply compared to ones that we looked at after the fact from Ulta in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is very big and should hold all my stuff.  the inside lining was a little bubbled but not enough to make me want to return it.  it came on time.</li>
    <li> I love this handy box. Their are all kinds of compartments where I can throw my stuff in, and surprisingly all my junk fits! Its something great to have to help you keep your beauty supplies organized.</li>
    <li> The construction is average.  The look and the ability to organize it as I want, with the movable slots to accommodate larger items is very good.  I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this case. I had tons of little organizers and they always ended up looking messy. Now it all folds up in a neat box on my bathroom counter. In seconds I can clear the whole counter. I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this case for my daughter, and she absolutely loves it!  No more lugging around all of the cosmetic bags, everything fits in one convenient case!</li>
    <li> Really great product. Came just as advertised. it came super quickly and was fully assembled and durable. I really like the color and how large the inside compartments are. Great product.</li>
    <li> I wanted a place to be able to put all of my makeup instead of it spread around all throughout my bedroom and bathroom. I don&#x27;t have a ton of makeup but I do have a decent amount and this traincase has proven worthy. Everything fits in with room for more it stays completely organized and I keep it in the corner of my closet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I thought it would be, but I really love it. Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed that may be a problem is that I have to close it by shutting it from the top trays and not the outside of the train box. This could be a challenge in the future when I have to move quickly and makes me concerned about the trays lasting. I still love it though and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Large, but not too big to fit in my bathroom vanity. Love the trays and all the organization!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for my fiance&#x27;s makeup and the other for me &amp; all my hair-cutting supplies.  This thing screams masculinity (for those of us who like to be organized with our grooming products).  I am the barber of the house and I have some expensive clippers and accessories; this organizer helps me keep everything together, neat, clean and most important safe.  I love this thing and because of its looks, can be used for numerous without looking ugly!!!</li>
    <li> This case is exactly what i was looking for. I received my shipment today and i was so excited to see how spacious the case was. It comes with different compartments which you can move around so you can adjust them to the size of your makeup products. It is also made very well made feels very durable. Overall i am very satisfied well worth the money!</li>
    <li> The Shany Cosmetics Pro Makeup Case is an excellent product. I first saw this product on America&#x27;s Next Top Model and my daughter wanted one. I purchased it two years ago and it still looks like new. The case is very sturdy. I liked it so well that I ordered another one for my youngest daughter and thinking about getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is bigger and better than expected. Similar ones in the price range was extremely smaller and junky.</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality, solid case. It closes smoothly, can adjust easily, and holds a lot of stuff. I wish that the bottom of the drawers weren&#x27;t grooved, because it makes it a bit more difficult to clean. But, overall a good buy that I&#x27;m still happy with almost a year later.</li>
    <li> This case is sturdy, spacious, and very professional looking! It locks, which is an added bonus. I LOVE my new makeup case!</li>
    <li> Buying a great long lasting case for your make up can be an extremely hard buy. But this brand made it much easier than I thought. The case comes in several designs made to match anybody’s personable style. Compared to other competitors, this one is massive for the more than reasonable cost as compared to other train cases. It is far bigger than I perceived it in the pictures provided. Furthermore, this case has keys for you to lock up everything, which, with the purchasing of good make up being an investment, it’s a great added feature to this product. The construction of the case seems very sturdy and durable. Any fall or harsh handling will not harm this case or disrupt the contents in it which keeps me assured that my purchases will stay in good shape for long usage. The case has four tiers that are about 4 inches deep each! The dividers allow for everything to fit comfortably in any place you designate, which also lets you customize things to your liking. My favorite part of this things is how large the bottom compartment is and lets me put in absolutely any other materials needed for applying and removing my face. The floor of it is lined with a very nice soft material as well. I am very much loving this case. I have been a big fan of SHANY for a little while now and they never fail to keep me impressed. I don’t have nearly enough to fill this thing up, but I know that I have that I have a lot of room to!!! Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great size for all my cosmetics. (Although I would recommended separate organization for your lip accoutrements.)&lt;br /&gt;2. Excellent packaging. Foam inserts provided space between item and packing box, so no damage during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;3. Case is lined with, I think, polyurethane foam to protect your cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;4. Beveled plastic dividers are included for customized organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. The main material appears to be a textured plastic. Aesthetically okay, but once you get your hands on it you can feel it.&lt;br /&gt;2. The edges don&#x27;t align without guidance and you will not be able to properly latch the case.&lt;br /&gt;3. The locking mechanisms require a bit of force and you may worry that you&#x27;ll break the key. Is locking even necessary? That&#x27;s up to you.&lt;br /&gt;4. The inner shelf/mechanism is not super smooth. It&#x27;s best if you open and close from midpoint rather than the corners.&lt;br /&gt;5. The dividers on the second shelf are not removable or adjustable. Nor can you add more due to the position of the top shelf. (This was particularly disappointing to me.)&lt;br /&gt;6. The main large compartment is separated by sturdy foam inserts that have been glued. I would have preferred personal customization.&lt;br /&gt;7. It&#x27;s a cheap plastic handle. Really. I&#x27;ll probably wrap it in some colored leather or maybe sisal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product, but definitely not for travel, frequent or professional use. I&#x27;d say product value is equal to what you pay for, which is unusual for a product from Amazon. (Usually value is way higher than cost paid.) My personal plans limit to home use only, so it fits my needs.</li>
    <li> Looks to be quality...Large, roomy interior, just as  described.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Fast shipment</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Bought this for my wife and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this and the fact that I can move the dividers. The only thing I do not like about it is that I can&#x27;t move the dividers on the bottom. The top four trays are not the best material but they are fine. All in all I think it was worth the price and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Looks sharp, Bought it for all the KISS make up I have, its good for the price, doesnt really close all that easy, the thing that upset me the most was the quarter size hole in the case from shipping, the case doesnt appear to be easy to break so im not sure how something went through the box, and wrapping and into the case, I could return it but i suppose ill just cover it up with something and just have it look trashy. Either way i think it will be fine.</li>
    <li> So I was super excited to get my new make-up case, but when I received it my excitement slowly began to dwindle. First, two of the bottom caps (not sure what they&#x27;re called) were broken off so my case sits all lop- sided and wobbly. Second, I feel like I&#x27;m gonna break the thing every time I open it. All the pieces are plastic and the compartments are small and awkward. Granted you can move the dividers around (if you dare, they&#x27;re just as flimsy) but the width is too small to fit most of my palettes. It&#x27;s better than what I had before, I was just hoping for a better quality considering the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick. It came in less than a week.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, I LOVE THIS CASE!!!  It far exceeded my expectations.  I am not a makeup artist, but would love to be one someday, and this case holds everything in my current makeup kit, with the exception of large eyeshadow pallets.  It came with a great strap for carrying as well as additional pieces to adjust the sizes of the slots (extremely useful).  The case itself is very durable and it even still easily closes with all the trays stuffed to the max.  I am so happy I purchased this case for traveling.  I highly recommend this case for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a ton of makeup, but needs to travel with some or just needs something to keep what they have organized.</li>
    <li> I love this make up case. I have had two others, my first was too tiny and was constantly tipping over when the shelves were extended. The second was from caboodles and the shelves were made out of cardboard, fell apart after about a year or two of light use. I have had this case for about 3 months now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note the first one I exchanged for another because when fully opened it didn&#x27;t lay flat, which made accessing the side shelves hard. Shany was great and immediately sent me out another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelves are made out of a molded plastic instead of cardboard, so no worries about it falling apart. It also comes with a shoulder strap which I love for when I&#x27;m doing friend&#x27;s makeup. It is actually bigger than my massive caboodles case but I still manage to fill it up. I love the adjustable dividers for organizing, but they can be irritating to move around. It came with plenty of dividers, 8 small dividers for the shelves and two large for the base. It locks up on both clasps, a great deterrent for little sisters or daughters but if you are motivated enough it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to get into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great case that I&#x27;m sure will last me for years to come.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying I did a month of research before settling on this specific accordion train case. I am male, and therefore may notice different things about a product than the opposite sex. However, I think this information can benefit everyone. In my circle I work with a lot of different materials so I have the experience to back up this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to use with my lightweight tools. You wont believe how hard it is to find a toolbox fully made out of corrosion resistant metal (like aluminum or stainless) because they&#x27;re all made out of nasty rusty steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the problems I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some of the corners were already rusting.&lt;br /&gt;- Part of the aluminum trim was warped/damaged.&lt;br /&gt;- The SHANY logo plate on the front was crooked.&lt;br /&gt;- The panels (not the trim or the corners, but the bumpy textured panels that make up most of the case) are not metal. The item description says &amp;#34;Made with solid aluminum.&amp;#34; I personally contacted SHANY and asked them what material the panels are made out of and they replied saying aluminum. The seller also told me the panels were made of aluminum. In addition, multiple reviewers and Q&amp;A posts said that the panels are made out of metal. This simply isn&#x27;t the case. The panels are made out of plastic. I tried everything to test it. Magnets don&#x27;t stick to it, I couldn&#x27;t run an electric current through it, it&#x27;s not cold to the touch, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- The description says &amp;#34;Unlike other brands SHANY have used aluminum on the handle, as well as the bottom of the case to ensure a long life of the item.&amp;#34; The handle is clearly plastic, even in the photos. The bottom is made out of the same stuff that the rest of the box is.&lt;br /&gt;- Another claim about the item is that it uses &amp;#34;Dust proof fabric as an interior.&amp;#34; The interior is lined with EVA craft foam - the stuff you can find in the children&#x27;s crafts isle at Walmart. Craft foam is not fabric.&lt;br /&gt;- The dividers made for the bottom-most compartment are made out of cardboard wrapped in craft foam. They don&#x27;t exactly scream &amp;#34;high quality and long lasting&amp;#34; to me.&lt;br /&gt;- Almost all reviewers said that they appreciate the option of being able to lock the case. A lot also have said that the locks don&#x27;t work at all. Here&#x27;s the truth: The locks work but are not easy to use. They don&#x27;t always lock or unlock correctly and there are no instructions provided. They&#x27;re fiddly and janky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not all bad though. The case does look cute and stylish. It holds a lot of stuff inside. The dividers are a very nicely designed bonus. You get 8 plastic dividers for the accordion trays and 3 cardboard/foam dividers for the bottom compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this case, especially after all the research I did. The lower build quality and cheap materials ruined it for me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure there are train cases much shoddier than this one. The problem here is that this is advertised like a high quality premium product, but it simply is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Well, after working with SHANY directly and going through 5 more makeup train cases of various brands, I decided to bump this review up by 1 star. It turns out for $40, this box is a solid choice. I encountered similarly priced cases that were of much poorer quality - the interior lining peeling off, misaligned indentations for the dividers (so all your dividers end up slanted), trays colliding against one another when you open or close them, etc. - at least the SHANY case doesn&#x27;t have these problems. Furthermore, SHANY&#x27;s customer service is top notch. My return was buttery smooth and the representative I worked with was patient, diligent, and understanding. I still can&#x27;t give the item itself a 5 star rating, but their customer service deserves an A+.The dividers made for the bottom-most compartment are made out of cardboard wrapped in craft foam.

    <li> not as bad as some put it out to be. very roomy and the outside looks flawless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this is a Christmas gift for my wife. I gave it to her early as we where going on a family road trip. The handle broke away from the case the very first use.</li>
    <li> better than expected- very well made at a great price</li>
    <li> This is not the best quality, not easy to open &amp; owe. On a positive note, it does hold a lot of make-up &amp; or nailpolish/nail art or whatever your heart desires. But the workmanship &amp; the material is not the best quality for my liking. It&#x27;s ok, but not the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup enthusiast and aspiring makeup artist. I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable train case to dump all my makeup into and found this one. I looked at the real heavy duty professional ones but they were way out of my price range at this point in my life for an organizational tool. Not the most heavy duty carryall but not flimsy either. In my opinion, this Shany train case is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I like how the top trays slide open along the inside of the case&#x27;s top so compactly to display everything as you open the case. The trays are plastic (as expected), with plastic removable dividers. Mine did not have any problems sliding open or customizing. Everything worked smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked at the Caboodles train cases and even considered purchasing; however, the Caboodles&#x27; trays were pre-sectioned and have to be manually pulled out toward the short sides (taking up a lot or space to the outside of the case itself).&lt;br /&gt;All the compartments are removable for a custom fit. The handle and locks all feel pretty sturdy. It came with a shoulder strap but I have not tried wearing it. I don&#x27;t plan on hauling my entire makeup collection around town or even traveling with it. If I were to do so, I would personally opt for the larger and heavier duty pro cases on wheels.&lt;br /&gt;My intention currently is just to have a nice holding place for all my makeup as opposed to digging through my bathroom drawers looking for one color. My case sits closed under the bathroom sink when not in use. When it is open, this case organizes and displays my collection beautifully. I can find almost everything I&#x27;ve stashed in there within a matter of seconds. As soon as I am done, I close it and everything is so neatly stashed away.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom storage area is large and lined in a thin layer of protective rubber foam. The dividers are completely removable for a space that holds all my larger Urban Decay, NYX, Stila kits, with plenty of space for additional compacts and implements.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this train case for any makeup enthusiast looking for a sleek way to organize their collection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before and I have to say that it&#x27;s now become crucial to my make-up survival and travel.  I travel twice a week back and forth via car and my usual travel cosmetic bag was getting beat.  This take a hit and keeps on ticking.  I&#x27;ve hit it against the car frame, the cabinet frame and all sorts of other things (it&#x27;s large) and it seems un-phased.  I haven&#x27;t bothered to try the locking mechanism yet.  The adjustable tray sizes are handy but I can only change the very most top trays.  haven&#x27;t figured out how to change the lower trays as the most top tray is in the way of allowing the dividers in or out.</li>
    <li> Great Space for all my makeup and MORE ! I still have lots more space. I got it in Black btw. Its very sturdy, easy to carry around (Ive traveled with it) . I like that it comes with a lock and key. One thing i wish is on the middle shelf the dividers could be repositioned as well as on the very bottom. This is defiantly a great buy for the price and I&#x27;m looking to buy another as my makeup collection expands !</li>
    <li> It was very helpfull and it was great, thanks for my article. here is your reviw for the purchases. .</li>
    <li> 7/1/13:&lt;br /&gt;I was really exited to receive this case!! I can store all of my products in one area; it&#x27;s very spacious and I love the sleek black color all around. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is interested in getting a makeup case. Upon receiving the item I was really surprised that it was larger than expected which was great (was comparing it to one I currently own that was pretty large already).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Color&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy handle&lt;br /&gt;Space&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable compartments in top shelves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Compartments in second level of shelving are not adjustable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! I&#x27;ll post again if any thing comes up (hopefully not!)</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought it was going to be but spacious on the inside. Kinda cheap on the inside but it will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 1 star, but since I got it for over 50% off during the holiday sales, I will give it an extra star.  Compared to the Caboodles cases I have that are the same size and style, this one is absolute trash.  The sides are thin and easily warped... the interior is cheaply put together and the hinges that the slide out trays rest on rub and scrape on one another.  It has hardly any weight to it at all.  I was hoping for a good case I could use to replace my now 5 year old caboodle, which is still in good structural condition, but getting quite beat up... but this will not be that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so wish Caboodles would drop their remodel of this size case and go back to the one this one is obviously copied from.  Quality on this case is horrifyingly bad.</li>
    <li> What a great way to keep and maintain my personal make-up supply, an upgrade from the plastic baggies that I was rocking before.  The adjustable compartments are handy for all different shapes and sizes of eye shadow, blush, etc.  Sleek, looks great whether in the bathroom for daily use, or on the go when traveling.</li>
    <li> I scored one of these on Amazon&#x27;s lightening deals for $27. It&#x27;s definitely bigger than expected, and even bigger on the inside. It also appealed to my husband because of the more masculine appearance and lack of mirror. He uses it for his electronics.</li>
    <li> I bought this with unreal expectations of it being gigantic and holding all my makeup (which is a lot). So when It arrived and I looked inside I was slightly taken back, but I just realized it&#x27;d be good for storing my primary makeup that I use everyday. The little slot things are all removable and it comes with extra incase you want more division. Like I said, not tons of space on the side trays (width wise) but overall good quality and very secure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a professional case, but it does the job. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected, which was a nice surprise. The inside does feel a little cheap, but it will do its job of holding my makeup. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. It is a lot bigger than it looks online which was a nice surprise. My sister has a pretty legit collection of makeup in terms of how many products she owns, and she was able to fit all of her items inside without a problem. So far she seems to like it and hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it. I&#x27;d recommend it for people looking for a new case that is spacy, yet not overwhelming --perhaps your basic everyday makeup wearer, but not a professional artist.</li>
    <li> nice size, a little glitchy opening and closing the case. overall okay for the price.I would buy it again though.</li>
    <li> All around a good product. Considering how pricey some makeup cases are I thought this was a pretty good deal. It has plenty of room and all of my stuff fit in it, including some extras that I wasn&#x27;t able to fit in my other case. Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  Her only complaint is that some of the partitions on the lower shelves are difficult to get in and out.  So she hasn&#x27;t moved them.  It fits her considerably large number of brushes and palettes.  It&#x27;s a great case for traveling, but it&#x27;s not necessarily something you&#x27;re going to want to use as your primary kit if you&#x27;re a full time makeup artist.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! A good deal, great product and fast delivery makes Amazon a winner with this Mom!</li>
    <li> great gift for me/gf my gf because it was a place where she could put ALL her makeup and have it in one place. for me because i got my bathroom counter back and now if i only could find a way for her to not miss the trash can with all the damn q tips! a boy can dream i guess...</li>
    <li> This is such a great size for all of my makeup needs and it&#x27;s big enough for me to keep adding more! I had no problems with shifting the dividers around. I think the others who complained about this didn&#x27;t realize that you have to turn the bottom divider for the big bottom compartment a little to the side (try turning it diagonally) before you can pull out the whole thing to create one big compartment at the bottom of the box. Additionally, the small dividers for the shelves can easily pull out as well, you just have to make sure that the shelves are stacked in a way that you&#x27;re being given the maximum amount of space to be able to pull out the small dividers. Once you do that, all you have to do is stretch the small shelf&#x27;s side a little and you can easily pull out the small dividers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this makeup train case seems to be built to last and feels very durable!</li>
    <li> Item was as described and pictured and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for or wanting a sleek storage case for all/most their makeup. Great for makeup artist kits if your just starting out or need something travel friendly!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend who had makeup in bag after bag. This thing stores everything, very nicely, looks good and is well built.</li>
    <li> Perfect makeup case I ever had!!</li>
    <li> This case is huge.  Lots of room with adjustable dividers in the shelves and the bottom unit.  The shelves are a cheap plastic, and I am hoping they hold up and make it easier to clean if something spills.  The outside is a nice quality fabric.  The reason I bought this product over a Caboodle..it locks!  That was a huge selling point for me</li>
    <li> The case was not level, has to be adjusted in order to close properly.&lt;br /&gt; I should have returned it but needed it for class.</li>
    <li> I went to pick it up and the entire handle snapped off. USELESS for anything but at home storage. Was not even half loaded/ not heavy at all. Very disappointed, would NOT recommend. I have had cases from Yazmo for over 5 years that held up better than this POS</li>
    <li> I ordered the box for myself. It arrived in 2 days because I have amazon prime. I love the box, but I can&#x27;t take the second row of dividers off or move them around, which is a bit annoying. The quality of the box was okay, mostly plastic/metal like.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I wasn&#x27;t sure what size case I was going to need and wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to hold up. After a couple of months of use, it turned out that it was just the right size!!! I keep 30 1 oz bottles of make up inside, my airbrush, my travel air brush compressor, all of my brushes (around 50), as well as other small miscellaneous makeup applicators, and I still have room for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lock works great and the clasps are all metal so they are capable of handling a lot of opening and closing. Even with everything in the case, it isn&#x27;t too heavy. I haven&#x27;t used the shoulder strap yet, but it is made a of heavy nylon that looks and feels like it will take a great deal of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> I have used this product everyday for the last 6 months and it has been great. It has tidied up my bathroom nicely and everything is really visible and accessible. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Big case &amp; fits a lot of cosmetics but it&#x27;s rough when you open &amp; close the case. It&#x27;s not as smooth to open or close but overall it&#x27;s an inexpensive big case that holds all your makeup products that you can take with you anywhere.</li>
    <li> too big&#x3D;&#x3D;unless you&#x27;re a clinician</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by the size of the case I thought is was going to be a lot smaller but it fits all my makeup perfectly and i love the the little &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; i guess that came with it.. that was a cute treat.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this case! It is sturdy and stylish. It&#x27;s the perfect size for all of my makeup - it was all over the place before and now it&#x27;s nice and organized! The only thing I found a little difficult was trying to move around the dividers on the 2nd level of compartments. However, I just removed mine completely as that worked better for my needs!</li>
    <li> Love it, lots of space to fit ALL MY STUFF! It a big case and exactly what I needed an a steal at this price</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it when I&#x27;m traveling</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price! Made the wife happy</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new makeup case for a while and local stores in my area cost just as much but we&#x27;re much smaller. This case is perfect and fits all of my makeup perfectly. Would absolutely recommend this case.</li>
    <li> Very handy cosmetic case! I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and still in great condition!</li>
    <li> Spacious, sleek, professional. Love it.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my wife, who absolutely loved it. Stores all her makeup without any space issues and the adjustable bins are perfect for her stuff.</li>
    <li> Nice, but not great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it is the sound it makes every time I open it, it sounds like the box will breakdown into pieces...that makes me open it really carefully. The inside of the small boxes are made by plastic, and could divide by blocks, my stuffs will hit the plastic or rolling inside the boxes when I open it, and the sounds really could make me mad...really sounds like everything is breaking down... My boyfriend has watched me open that box once and ask me if it&#x27;s really a new one...</li>
