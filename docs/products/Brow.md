      <li>AND THIS ONE WORKS FOR SURE!</li>
      <li>Perhaps that is why it is not as effective.</li>
      <li>nice surprise....</li>
      <li>Also a good way to conserve makeup because I just use my mascara for color on top, but this product creates the length for me underneath.</li>
      <li>I felt like it was doing more harm then good.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect Latisse growth results, but it&#x27;s a nice lash conditioner</li>
      <li>Still using it and wish it can get even better.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t accelerate the growth of my lashes, but the way I see it, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic and affordable!</li>
      <li>I have purchased many times and this is now a staple item of mine.</li>
      <li>I have tried many lash and brow conditioners from Ardell to Jan Marini.</li>
      <li>I saw some good reviews about this product and the price was right.  </li>
      <li>And after using this consistently for a period of time, i now have perfect eye brows thanks to this and leaving them alone to grow in.</li>
      <li>The cost is incredible - one Bare Essentials gel was $22.  </li>
      <li>I loved the customer support and fast shipping.</li>

      <li>One of the things I really love about this product is that it protects my lashes when removing mascara, since I apply this underneath first.</li>
      <li>I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes-it did not cause any kind of reaction.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I rarely write comments</li>
      <li>Worth the price.  </li>
      <li>For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
      <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>My lashes looked longer almost right away, and my sparse brows filled in nicely after a few weeks.</li>
      <li>Make sure to let it dry completely before applying mascara on top though.</li>
      <li>Ardell Brow and Lash Growth really does work!</li>
      <li>My eyebrows started to appear thicker after the first week.  </li>
      <li>If you are consistent with using  the  product then you will see results in 14 days.</li>
      <li>Just a few swipes on my eye lashes and were good to go.</li>
      <li>Had it for a few weeks now, don&#x27;t notice any growth progress but it is a good primer for the eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge amount of length, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>This really does help with brown and lash growth.</li>
      <li>The Ardell Brow and Lash Growth accelerator really works.</li>
      <li>but I almost can&#x27;t believe how well, how fast, and how inexpensively this worked.</li>
      <li>and I can really see a difference on both my eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Make sure you aren&#x27;t tearing when you apply and that you are careful or it will BURN and you will need to wash everything off.</li>
      <li>It dries fast.</li>
      <li>May take a while, but it makes the brows and lashes more supple and therefore less breakage.</li>
      <li>I USE THIS RATING BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin, but this product is completely fine once dry.</li>

      <li>She swears that she is growing new lashes and brows - despite her skepticism.  </li>
      <li>, WOW is all I can say!  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to be careful when applying and not to smear while wet to avoid any irritation.</li>
      <li>Constantly getting compliments and people asking if they are my real lashes, so this stuff I swear by</li>
      <li>When you see the results might label for now is too early to know if it works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 16 years old</li>
      <li>I have definitely notices that my eyebrows are filling in and don&#x27;t need the brow pencil as much.  </li>
      <li>Will not buy again, but will use the tube to make my own lash growth/strengthener out of castor oil and a few other things.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been using it again and my lashes are full and there&#x27;s less fallout.  </li>
      <li>I thought only the high end products would work</li>
      <li>I would recommend adding a little bit of extra virgin olive oil into this product, or just using extra virgin olive oil to condition your lashes; my lashes were better conditioned when I used this method.</li>
      <li>Gone are the days of my youthful thick full brows, or so I thought until trying this product!</li>
      <li>I used this twice daily for about three months and have not seen any evidence of new lash growth.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how much they have grown, but it is substantial because prior to trying this they were getting a little skimpy.  </li>
      <li>If you have thin eyelashes this will add volume and  its great for the brows, its not too stiff.</li>
      <li>I still have 2 more tubs left &amp; they will sit no good to me.</li>
      <li>and whenever I was in jr high school I plucked my eyebrows every single day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would recommend this product to women that are trying to grow their lashes. If you are consistent with using  the  product then you will see results in 14 days. Great product. Fast delivery. Good price.</li>
    <li> This product was something I felt iffy about but works  with time! Just what I needed, so happy I found it!</li>
    <li> Just as promised. Quick shipping. Works great. I would order again and use it again. I noticed small results in a week. And it keeps working if you use it as directed. Day or Night.</li>
    <li> This works great on my brows and lashes... I put it on every night, it conditions and prevents  breakage.  My lashes looked longer almost right away, and my sparse brows filled in nicely after a few weeks. I didn&#x27;t notice thicker lashes, just longer ones... and when I stop using it, I do notice thinner brows within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice surprise.... I have an area where my brow has never grown in since I had a mole removed (about 15 years ago).  After a month of using this on my brows, I was happily shocked to see a few new hairs in the area.  Just a few, but that&#x27;s something.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from using this gel, but it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m doing differently.  I will never be without this stuff now!</li>
    <li> I saw the results on a friend. I know it works. I just got it and I&#x27;m starting to see it on me. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using for a couple weeks, lashes seem to be a little softer.  Goes on really thick.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years, I use it as a primer and my use it with Rapidlash. Between the two, one of them has made my eyelashes thick nd long. But using it before I apply my mascara is a must now. I always buy it by the 3- pack.</li>
    <li> Ive purchased these in the past and they very soon became apart of my beauty routine. Just a few swipes on my eye lashes and were good to go. It can easily be worn undwr makeup. They dont become these fake looking lashes but i noticed a difference. Subtle.&lt;br /&gt;And as for eye brows i use it at night after washing my face and then to set my eyebrows after doing my makeup. I wish i had a before of my eyebrows but they were the typical over plucked eye brows. And after using this consistently for a period of time, i now have perfect eye brows thanks to this and leaving them alone to grow in.</li>
    <li> When you see the results might label for now is too early to know if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it regularly, but to wait.</li>
    <li> I noticed no growth or added thickness with this product at all. When I tried it on my eye lashes and went to bed it got in my eye and burned.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was inexpensive and I was curious. I have been using Ardell Accelerator morning and night for about a month. My eyelashes are noticeably longer and thicker. I also tried this product on my eyebrows but didn&#x27;t see any results. Still, I love my lashes! For the price, why not give it try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product. Will buy again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006P09SAM Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator]]</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it made my lashes feel cripsy and stiff. I felt like it was doing more harm then good. Will not buy again, but will use the tube to make my own lash growth/strengthener out of castor oil and a few other things.</li>
    <li> One of the things I really love about this product is that it protects my lashes when removing mascara, since I apply this underneath first. Make sure to let it dry completely before applying mascara on top though. I don&#x27;t like using waterproof mascara or ones that are hard to get off because it damages my lashes, so using this underneath nourishes them and makes it easier when removing makeup as well since this stuff slides right off. Also a good way to conserve makeup because I just use my mascara for color on top, but this product creates the length for me underneath. I have purchased many times and this is now a staple item of mine. Constantly getting compliments and people asking if they are my real lashes, so this stuff I swear by. I use it on my eyebrows too instead of gel so that it holds them and nourishes. Only issue with this product is, DO NOT get it in your eye. Make sure you aren&#x27;t tearing when you apply and that you are careful or it will BURN and you will need to wash everything off. I do have sensitive skin, but this product is completely fine once dry. Just make sure to be careful when applying and not to smear while wet to avoid any irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into week 4 of using this product.  I&#x27;ve been applying in the morning and the evening.  My eyebrows started to appear thicker after the first week.  I am able to skip eyebrow pencil as the hair that is coming in is my original color, not gray.  At the end of week 3 I began to notice that my lashes are thickening, too.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My brows have filled in beautifully but I have not noticed any change in my lashes.  Other lash-building products required application along the lash line; however this one is brushed on like mascara. Perhaps that is why it is not as effective. However, nothing else had made my eyebrows fuller and this has.</li>
    <li> Did help my brow grow a little bit, but not as expected. Still using it and wish it can get even better.</li>
    <li> Whenever my eyebrows get over plucked by the salon I can always rely on this product to nurse my brows back to health</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect Latisse growth results, but it&#x27;s a nice lash conditioner and I definitely see improvement.  My lashes look stronger, longer and fuller.  Worth the price.  I&#x27;ve been using for almost a year and plan to continue.</li>
    <li> This product seem to work as described it condition lashes and I seem to notice the lash line became darker. It dries fast. I loved the customer support and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lash and brow conditioners from Ardell to Jan Marini. Ardell&#x27;s Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator works as well as the products for which I paid $150! It needs to be used nightly per the directions and within the month you will notice thicker and longer lashes...for around $3 a tube. The tube lasts about a month so it&#x27;s a great deal! :-)</li>
    <li> I find this product does no work and gave it about 6 weeks to do so and no results yet very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter used Bare Essentials brow gel every day, not to grow lashes, but rather as a setting gel (to keep them in place after putting a colored powder on them first to make them even).  My daughter got a scar when she was younger and no hair grows in the scar, so she puts brow powder on her eyebrow to hide the scar and then needs to set it with gel. My wife just has thinning brows due to age.  For some reason, the Bare Essentials gel was discontinued, and if you can still find it, super expensive. So she decided to try this - not to grow her brows or lashes - but simply as a substitute for the holding gel.  The cost is incredible - one Bare Essentials gel was $22.  We got three of these tubes for less than that.  She has been using it daily on her brows and lashes. She swears that she is growing new lashes and brows - despite her skepticism.  No matter what, if you just use it as a setting gel, it works.  Growth is just an added bonus, and for the price, who can complain?  This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> No success.  Just made my brow area itch.</li>
    <li> I used this twice daily for about three months and have not seen any evidence of new lash growth.  This has not provided any visible evidence of improvement in my lashes.  It was a waste of money and I would certainly not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great at a great price. I have been using Ardell brow and lash growth every morning and night for about 2 months now and I can really see a difference on both my eyelashes and eyebrows (they look think and long). I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> I choose this because it sounded like it do the job. I have had it for a few weeks now . There is no different now then what I had before . I still have 2 more tubs left &amp; they will sit no good to me. I told my friends who wanted to buy not to spend the money as it be a waist of money. If any one out there has tried any thing else &amp; it works let me know please.  As I&#x27;m still with out brows.</li>
    <li> The Ardell Brow and Lash Growth accelerator really works. I noticed my eyelashes growing longer within a couple of days. The effect is only visible on lenght though. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and plan to continue using it for a long time (my eyelashes had gotten very short throughout the years), and as part of a maintenance plan.&lt;br /&gt;The price point is amazing, and delivery is pretty quick.</li>
    <li> Had it for a few weeks now, don&#x27;t notice any growth progress but it is a good primer for the eyelashes.  If you have thin eyelashes this will add volume and  its great for the brows, its not too stiff.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my aunty and she loves it. She said the price is very attractive as she use to pay more.</li>
    <li> This really does help with brown and lash growth. May take a while, but it makes the brows and lashes more supple and therefore less breakage.</li>
    <li> I had picked this product up at the store (can&#x27;t remember what store) once on a whim.  My lashes did begin to get a bit thicker.  When I wanted more product (after months of using the first bottle), I tried to find it but couldn&#x27;t.  Amazon had it and for a good price so I&#x27;ve been using it again and my lashes are full and there&#x27;s less fallout.  Good product...though I am probably going to just use vaseline after I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
    <li> This is my second time I purchased this product.  My eyebrows and lashes grew.  I would recommend for anyone to try.</li>
    <li> WORST WASTE OF MONEY EVERRRRRRR!!!! Don&#x27;t buy this!!!! I used it for over 6 months and there is no difference.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that after having my daughter, I started to lose a lot of my eyelashes.  I used to have the thick, long lashes as a child, but now they were disappearing. I have wanted to use an eyelash product but they all seemed so expensive.  I saw some good reviews about this product and the price was right.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks and I am noticing that my eyelashes seem thicker and I am not noticing them falling out as often or at all!  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge amount of length, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks. I am also applying it to my eyebrows. Due to over-tweezing as a teenager, they&#x27;ve thinned out in places so I need to fill them in with a brow pencil.  I have definitely notices that my eyebrows are filling in and don&#x27;t need the brow pencil as much.  But with how glossy my eyelashes look and how thick they&#x27;ve gotten, I will use this forever!</li>
    <li> Ardell Brow and Lash Growth really does work! It thickened my lashes and eyebrows. I did not think it would work, but it did. Well worth the investment. I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes-it did not cause any kind of reaction. You must give it at least 3-4 weeks before you see a difference. I will admit that I did use it with \\&quot;Rapid Lash\\&quot;, also purchased at Amazon. They are a great combo.[[ASIN:B00512HBQ8 RapidLash Eyelash Serum]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start this review letting you know a little bit about me. I am 16 years old and whenever I was in jr high school I plucked my eyebrows every single day. That is no exaggeration. So now, desperate for perfect eyebrows, I decided this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad product to try because I bought 3 tubes for $10. I thought only the high end products would work but I was wrong. I have been using this product for 8 days now and I have noticed a huge improvement in my eyebrows. They are now thicker and I am growing my hair back! I am receiving compliments and I&#x27;ve been asked what I&#x27;m using to make them look so beautiful. Seriously buy this. Believe me.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago and it worked well for me then. But now, it just seems like an average product~ I would recommend adding a little bit of extra virgin olive oil into this product, or just using extra virgin olive oil to condition your lashes; my lashes were better conditioned when I used this method. It doesn&#x27;t accelerate the growth of my lashes, but the way I see it, it&#x27;s better than nothing. I plan to add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil to mine. This product doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and it seems to stay on my lashes while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS RATING BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET THAT I HAVE TRYED AND THIS ONE WORKS FOR SURE!</li>
    <li> I apply this to my eye lashes and eye brows every night before bed, and I do notice the difference after only about a week. My cousin tried and noticed the difference as well. I think this type of product has different effects on different people; you just have to try it. For the price, it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> It did just what it claims, and the price is incredible. I rarely write comments but I almost can&#x27;t believe how well, how fast, and how inexpensively this worked. I tend to have sensitivity with eye makeup products, and had NO issues with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I cannot tell you how dramatically my lashes have improved over such a short period of time!  I can feel it any time I touch my lashes and when I curl them and put on mascara, WOW is all I can say!  I don&#x27;t know exactly how much they have grown, but it is substantial because prior to trying this they were getting a little skimpy.  Not anymore!!  I can&#x27;t say enough about Ardell!  It is fantastic and affordable!</li>
    <li> Used the product for years and saw results in my lashes. They were thicker and longer....for the price you can not beat it!!  Let face it, mascara gives you  eyelashes a beat down this product puts back what we as mascara wearers take out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the 3 pack, but never did receive the item. I was given a refund!</li>
    <li> Gone are the days of my youthful thick full brows, or so I thought until trying this product! I was the unfortunate victim of a bad eyebrow threading and had spots with missing hair. I tried this product and after several uses my hair appeared thicker. After 2 months my hair is starting to grow back but I&#x27;m not sure if the growth of my brows is because the length of time (natural duration of eyebrow growth) or the product. That is why I rated this product a 4. Buy 3 products because if you don&#x27;t continually use it eyebrows will return to their original thin appearance. I also tried the brow gel in black to help mask the spots of missing hair. I got clown eyebrows. I would return it but I cannot find the receipt. So use this instead and have patience.</li>
