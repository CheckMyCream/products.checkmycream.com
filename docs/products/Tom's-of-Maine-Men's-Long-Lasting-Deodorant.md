### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And excellent product and wonderful</li>
      <li>This is coming from someone with very good hygiene.</li>
      <li>The scent is almost indiscernible, which is great since I wear cologne.</li>
      <li>Will keep buying for sure!</li>
      <li>great price and received order quickly!</li>
      <li>works well, and safe for your health</li>
      <li>I love Tom&#x27;s products, and I have used their deodorants for years.  </li>
      <li>I just wish there were more scents to choose from.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off not wearing any deodorant at all.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully it goes on easily and does not stain clothes.  </li>
      <li>more so this has been such a great product.</li>
      <li>Well let me say I love everything organic, this product is nice and i applaud the effort for trying to make an all natural product</li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance, with a woodsy, herbal smell to it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important that my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; odors don&#x27;t distract my students.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The product on its own smells decent.  </li>
      <li>I sweat easily but rarely smell.  </li>
      <li>I just wanted to have a back up for when I didn&#x27;t have time to make more of my own.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean Confidence since the beginning of this school year.  </li>
      <li>Full stop.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, without being overpowering, and it keeps my natural odors in check.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural deodorant, and since I like Tom&#x27;s toothpaste</li>
      <li>When I applied it, however, it only smelled nice for about an hour, after that it was all downhill.  </li>
      <li>Keeps you dry, doesnt stain your t shirts, has a really nice smell and doesn&#x27;t contain the chems that all the others do.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>If this was my first experience with your brand I would not have been a repeat customer.</li>
      <li>Great scent and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Toms deodorant is all natural and aluminum free.  </li>
      <li>Raw lemon almost works just as good.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you try it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad at long last</li>
      <li>I usually make my own deodorant out of all natural products.  </li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to deodorants.  </li>
      <li>It does feel a bit gloopie overall, though, when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product keeps you fresh and dry and never leaves marks on your clothes.</li>
      <li>wow...</li>
      <li>I work out a lot and naturally sweat</li>
      <li>I gave it a fair chance (one week) and am sorry to say I&#x27;ll be throwing it away and trying something else.</li>
      <li>I like the company but this particular stick simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend who also uses Tom&#x27;s deodorant tried this particular one, and had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Same with my 18 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>Even more frustrating was that I wasn&#x27;t even sweating that day.  </li>
      <li>but it simply does not last very long, definately not the whole day.</li>
      <li>This particular deodorant must be a different formula than their other deodorants however, because I stink.  </li>

<li> Even other products of Tom&#x27;s do not work, I stink after three hours of putting it on.</li>
<li> I bought this because I started to have an allergic reaction to my Other deodorant, but</li>
<li> It just froths a little bit if your armpits are even slightly damp.</li>
<li> I used to be the sweaty guy, I mean my pits were wet all the time!</li>
<li> This stupid thing only last a couple hours max.</li>
<li> I tried every deodorant out there, even  the expensive clinical sticks.  </li>
<li> so it starts to get very expensive.</li>
<li> So disappointed. :(  </li>
<li> This stuff sucks!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No metals? Thank you very much. Done. Full stop.</li>
    <li> I am a teacher. I sweat, a lot.  I am on my feet all day, moving, taking, instructing, demonstrating, listening, laughing.  It&#x27;s important that my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; odors don&#x27;t distract my students.  With other deodorants my under arms are soaked by mid-morning.  I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean Confidence since the beginning of this school year.  It smells nice, without being overpowering, and it keeps my natural odors in check.  I like it and it works.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s has been my go-to deodorant for years now. I literally couldn&#x27;t find one that actually helps with sweating. I work out a lot and naturally sweat more so this has been such a great product. I highly recommend you try it! Get away from those other brands. This one actually helps cut down on the sweat-that is unless its a sweat induced activity.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I started to have an allergic reaction to my Other deodorant, but wow...If I apply this at 8:00am, my armpits are funky by 5:00pm. This is coming from someone with very good hygiene. I gave it a fair chance (one week) and am sorry to say I&#x27;ll be throwing it away and trying something else.</li>
    <li> I used to be the sweaty guy, I mean my pits were wet all the time! I tried every deodorant out there, even  the expensive clinical sticks.  Turns out I&#x27;m allergic to the aluminum they put in antiperspirants. Toms deodorant is all natural and aluminum free.  Ever since switching (6 months ago) I&#x27;ve been dry and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular stick actually smells like lemon, not sure why they have a picture of a wave on the front.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t last an hour. In fact, I find it to intensify my body odor instead of neutralizing it (not kidding). You&#x27;re better off not wearing any deodorant at all. Try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boys and it seem to work well. I&#x27;m glad at long last i have a safer deodorant for the family.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to deodorants.  The last few Products gave me rashes and sores. Even other products of Tom&#x27;s do not work, I stink after three hours of putting it on. With this product, however, the effects last all day long and even the next day and I still do not smell. Will keep buying for sure! I just wish there were more scents to choose from.</li>
    <li> So disappointed. :(  I usually make my own deodorant out of all natural products.  I just wanted to have a back up for when I didn&#x27;t have time to make more of my own.  I sweat easily but rarely smell.  This product actually made me have body odor after just a couple hours.  Same with my 18 year old daughter.  So bummed!</li>
    <li> I love Tom&#x27;s products, and I have used their deodorants for years.  This particular deodorant must be a different formula than their other deodorants however, because I stink.  My girlfriend who also uses Tom&#x27;s deodorant tried this particular one, and had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose a different Tom&#x27;s deodorant than this one, and Tom&#x27;s of Maine - please take this one off the shelf.  If this was my first experience with your brand I would not have been a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Didnt work too well for me. I wish it would have. Raw lemon almost works just as good.</li>
    <li> This stupid thing only last a couple hours max. I have to keep re-applying it so it starts to get very expensive. Especially since it is 2.25oz. Will look for something else or go back to using baking soda.</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry, doesnt stain your t shirts, has a really nice smell and doesn&#x27;t contain the chems that all the others do. Its my go-to deodorant moving forward.</li>
    <li> works well, and safe for your health</li>
    <li> Great scent and long lasting. There&#x27;s only one problem-- it&#x27;s a bit sticky if you&#x27;re not wearing clothing in between it and your skin.</li>
    <li> great price and received order quickly!</li>
    <li> I like the company but this particular stick simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Lives up to its name &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34;. The scent is almost indiscernible, which is great since I wear cologne. It just froths a little bit if your armpits are even slightly damp.</li>
    <li> Going au naturale has a smelly downside.</li>
    <li> Well let me say I love everything organic, this product is nice and i applaud the effort for trying to make an all natural product but it simply does not last very long, definately not the whole day.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural deodorant, and since I like Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, I figured why not give the deodorant a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product on its own smells decent.  It has a light fragrance, with a woodsy, herbal smell to it.  When I applied it, however, it only smelled nice for about an hour, after that it was all downhill.  Maybe my body&#x27;s chemistry just doesn&#x27;t mix well with it, but it smelled worse than my normal body odor.  Even more frustrating was that I wasn&#x27;t even sweating that day.  I was just sitting in my cubicle at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully it goes on easily and does not stain clothes.  It does feel a bit gloopie overall, though, when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... for me, it was a no go.</li>
    <li> And excellent product and wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance never overpowers.&lt;br /&gt;The product keeps you fresh and dry and never leaves marks on your clothes.</li>
