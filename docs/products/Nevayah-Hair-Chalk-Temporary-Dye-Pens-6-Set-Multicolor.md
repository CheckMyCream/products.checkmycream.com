<li> Does not dry and doesn&#x27;t stay in hair.</li>
<li> Got this mainly for the green and orange for Saint Patricks Day.  </li>
<li> My 1 year old even got green hair</li>
<li> Color was as expected, but we couldn&#x27;t get a brush through her hair until two washings later.  </li>
<li> Would like them in other  ccolors also like brown, deep purple, teal...  </li>
<li> The only downside is the green was a bit dark</li>
<li> I have 4 boys that needed crazy hair, and one that just REALLY wanted a red streak.</li>
<li> It showed up extremely well on my daughter&#x27;s dark blond hair, almost as well as hair dye.</li>
<li> both times we used this we put it on at least 6 people before we finally ran out.</li>
<li> He has thicker dark brown hair/ beard.</li>
<li> I did half of his beard orange and the other half green.</li>
<li> I have very dark brown hair.</li>
<li> and I had to wash it at lease 4/5 times before all the green was out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> We used them again for a Mud Run a few weeks ago  </li>
<li> Its a little waxy so you can even style the hair a bit too!</li>
<li> No good if you can&#x27;t get a brush through the hair afterward!</li>
<li> Totally useless.  </li>
<li> Ugly colors...believe me.  </li>
<li> DOES NOT WORK,  AND WOULD NOT REFUND BAD PRODUCT!!</li>
<li> Just Awful!</li>
<li> This stuff is sticky and feels awful.</li>

    <li> We just did the bottom 3&amp;#34; of daughter&#x27;s hair.  Color was as expected, but we couldn&#x27;t get a brush through her hair until two washings later.  No good if you can&#x27;t get a brush through the hair afterward!</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for something quick and less messy to add some fun color for a night out. This stuff is sticky and feels awful.</li>
    <li> Would like them in other  ccolors also like brown, deep purple, teal...  Also, I bought a second set because I saw the word metallic but they are not but I wish they were.</li>
    <li> My daughter, with pale blond hair, had a great time with this chalk! It&#x27;s easy to use and washes out in a couple of shampoos.</li>
    <li> Got this mainly for the green and orange for Saint Patricks Day.

I have very fine, thin, straight hair and I had to wash it at lease 4/5 times before all the green was out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, It worked perfectly on my husbands beard and head. He has thicker dark brown hair/ beard. I did half of his beard orange and the other half green. The only downside is the green was a bit dark so I had to add yellow to it to make it brighter/stand out more. It also works well on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors blend really well, but if you get caught in the rain they will drip/wash out. We used them again for a Mud Run a few weeks ago  and it didn&#x27;t hold up too well to the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a surprising amount in the small container too! both times we used this we put it on at least 6 people before we finally ran out.</li>
    <li> Salon quality - worth trying particularly at this price.  It was a hit gift with the young lady.</li>
    <li> Totally useless.  Ugly colors...believe me.  It does NOT apply either.</li>
    <li> I have golden blonde hair and the colors seem light on it, especially the purple. Tr red was good but if I spend money like this on hair color I want them all to look good. The Edge brand was much better!</li>
    <li> Works great on hair of all shades, including dark hair. Stays on through brushes, comes out easily with shampoo.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  Will not buy again.</li>

    <li> I have very dark brown hair. None of the colors showed up.</li>

    <li> This is the best temp hair color I have ever used. My 5 year old always begs me to put temp color in her hair but cause she&#x27;s blonde it always ends up sticking to her roots.  Not this color. It washes right off. But doesn&#x27;t come off except in the bath. My 1 year old even got green hair and I was so happy with how quickly it washed away. Great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE these. I have 4 boys that needed crazy hair, and one that just REALLY wanted a red streak. The color is easy to apply, stays for a couple days and VERY easily washes out. Its a little waxy so you can even style the hair a bit too!</li>
