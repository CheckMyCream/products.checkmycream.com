      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied!</li>
      <li>A great shampoo for cleansing the scalp and removing DHT.</li>
      <li>just because Rogaine makes it, it should be great,</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell and lathers well.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing!  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is good at controlling hair fall.</li>
      <li>It helps my fair from falling out.</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff.</li>
      <li>Smells good and feels good.</li>
      <li>a good addition to those like me who also use Progaine foam,</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat it for effectiveness and the price is a LOT cheaper than salon products that don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for years and think it is a good shampoo</li>
      <li>Good for thinning hair.</li>
      <li>IT IS AS GOOD AS ANY &amp;#34;FINE HAIR THICKENING SHAMPOO&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mom you look so good today,  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, based on the linking of this product with Rogaine, and the good reviews it has</li>
      <li>This product works so well and was for a good price.</li>
      <li>So I can not give a good review</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>and I am so pleased!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and my fine hairs looked great.</li>
      <li>Works great when available.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s not as good as Finesse volumizing shampoo, which is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>honestly don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
      <li>I find it handy that it can be purchased through the Amaon site</li>
      <li>It really does add volume which is awesome when you have thinning hair!</li>
      <li>CVS had their own \\&quot;Store brand\\&quot; of this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap and good product.</li>
      <li>The best, most effective thing so far has been Rogaine 5% minoxidil foam.</li>
      <li>Excellent shampoo that cleans very well, smells great, and is gentle on the hair.</li>
      <li>I did notice some increase in hair thickness, so maybe it&#x27;s suitable for some people and not others.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very happy with Progaine as far as volume and manageability.</li>
      <li>my hair is very fine and this shampoo is giving me volume.</li>
      <li>never heard of Progaine until I started using Rogaine in an attempt to stop the thinning on the top of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will buy a couple more.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you - I was balding on top of my head and noticed it in a photo in 2004.  </li>
      <li>and I found it even better than Nexxus Volumizing Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Bought a couple of bottled and it seems to give my hair more volume.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the feeling after using it.</li>
      <li>OK product.</li>
      <li>It did nothing to make my hair fuller or have more volume</li>
      <li>This shampoo is okay.  </li>
      <li>I am amazed yet pleased with the price, the size of the bottle, and the way it works.</li>
      <li>but Progain makes it more valumized.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing to take home to mother.  </li>
      <li>Save your money for a better shampoo</li>
      <li>I needed to get more of this, so I could continue getting those results.</li>
      <li>Be sure to massage this into your scalp.  </li>
      <li>I have tried it for about a month and haven&#x27;t experience any magic difference.</li>
      <li>My hair looks better for about a day after I use this.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was so pleased with what Rogaine did for me in just 3 months</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product, just don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for it....</li>
      <li>really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
      <li>and i have lost more hair.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a CVS plug (except for being able to buy Progaine</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it works for me.</li>
      <li>My head and shoulders hair endurance works better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am an older woman have been using 5% rogaine over a year (under DR&#x27;s supervision) with great</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair feeling so soft, and never dries it out.  </li>
      <li>sure to use the subscribe and save option so you can get a discount and free shipping.</li>
      <li>I wish I could really find a shampoo with good price that would stop my hair from falling.</li>
      <li>Because of the excellent reviews and the high cost I paid, I kinda ignored it, thought maybe was normal at the beginning.</li>
      <li>(it never claimed it does anyway), but sure makes my hair feels clean.</li>
      <li>It is the best thickening shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - hands down!  </li>
      <li>It works, smells great and actually soothes the scalp.</li>
      <li>so I use a light conditioner.</li>
      <li>At the price, the results you get are more than worth it.</li>
      <li>found this product on Amazon and had to get it because of the cheap price, and that it is from the makers of rogaine.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>Organix works better and it ain&#x27;t 100 a bottle Organix purple bottle full and thick with vitamin B7 best shampoo I ever used</li>
      <li>Not a bad Shampoo, can&#x27;t really tell the difference in my hair to be honest.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda pricey considering it didn&#x27;t add any significant volume to my hair or make it feel any thicker.</li>
      <li>Not only am I satisfied with the product I am very satisfied with the quick way it came to me.</li>
      <li>What would help is if they come out with a shampoo + conditioner version so that it can clean an treat your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not seeing any hair growth improvements but it does keep my hair clean.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re both really good, but I like the other one better because it has conditioner in it.</li>
      <li>there is nothing special about it aside from it&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>I switched to regen pure after a lengthy article stating that it works better.</li>
      <li>5 stars when I get a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>Got it on line, but think I will switch to something more reasonable.</li>
      <li>and I have my full head of hair and</li>
      <li>was glad you had it at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product but price is nothing but price gouging!</li>
    <li> No real benefit to hair loss... shame on me for hoping</li>
    <li> May be its my hair and my scalp, but it itches my scalp. I used it for three days, and I stopped.</li>
    <li> It does say on the bottle that it does NOT contain Rogaine. That said, I&#x27;m kinda neutral on this product. My hair does seem a little thicker (but it&#x27;s actually curling as it gets longer), and it may be worth a try for people who want to try and thicken their hair if price isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Helpp helpppp get this shampoo back! Best shampoo everrrrr!!! Just awesome!!!!! Any idea when it will come back!!! Plzzzzz</li>
    <li> I like this product but it has become unavailable in this aeea or at least where I purchased it in the past.  I find it handy that it can be purchased through the Amaon site</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing to take home to mother.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d bother to reorder once my 6 bottles are up.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for thin hair.  I have used this for over 10 years and have nothing but praise for it.  I can only find it online now, so thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap and good product. I&#x27;m not sure if it helps hairloss at all (it never claimed it does anyway), but sure makes my hair feels clean. It stops the itch on my sculpt after using for a week. Not bad.</li>
    <li> I have tried it for about a month and haven&#x27;t experience any magic difference. It does what shampoo normally does, but regarding \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; function, disappointing, it seems not work on my hair. Maybe I should continue to use it and then see what will happen.</li>
    <li> Does not have the effect that it claims to have, period. Did not notice thicker hair after use for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not dry for me at all. I love the feeling after using it. Just hope it can really stop my hair falling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been trying to find something that worked on my fine hair but less expensive than what I&#x27;d been paying. Very happy with Progaine as far as volume and manageability.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly AND it works so very well with Rogaine. I have been using this for over 10 years and it, along with Rogaine, have restored all my lost hair!</li>
    <li> It does volumize that hair as claimed, but it also leaves my hair somewhat dry and fly-away. However, I do live in a very dry climate, so it might work better in a more humid place. Still, it&#x27;s not as good as Finesse volumizing shampoo, which is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Wow! Used for the first time and hair is DEFINITELY thicker looking. Luv it! Only have to use a tiny bit - will last a LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Just ordered 4 bottles from buy.co_ for $25.96 w/free ship. Amazon needs to stay on top of prices, I hate to have to shop hard when I used to believe amazon was as good as it gets. Tighten up amazon.</li>
    <li> Really thankful I found this shampoo.  It really does add volume which is awesome when you have thinning hair!</li>
    <li> went through 3 bottles and i have lost more hair. I switched to regen pure after a lengthy article stating that it works better. I am using that along with nioxin (which is supposed to give it volue). My hair loss comes from the front. I am also using a minoxidil product as well.  I will update in a month. BUT AVOID THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s basically rogaine using their name to extend their product line to shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is a little thin on top of my scalp, and when I use it, somehow the thinness goes away! on days that I have to use other shampoos, the thinness is instantly back. Great buy, great price, buy it!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this shampoo for 6 dollars what happened!</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that my thinning hair would have the results i read everywhere else. It dried out my hair and made it look even thinner. So I can not give a good review, I dont know if its my hair type or what. i have oily hair to begin with so I was not worried about the dryness that other people talked about, however my hair was extremely flat and dried out, I even gave it a couple weeks just to be sure, and it was just gross, by the end of the day I felt like I needed to shower again. My hair was limp and lifeless, and by the end of the day not even smooth anymore just funky.</li>
    <li> Not only am I satisfied with the product I am very satisfied with the quick way it came to me.</li>
    <li> I should have bothered to read the ingredients listed!! Argh. Had no idea it contained Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Dries up my hair, making it much drier than it already is. Wasted purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo as a companion to the conditioner version of it. Neither the conditioner nor the shampoo did anything to my hair. I was hoping that my hair would stop falling, but it feels like it became worse. I wish I could really find a shampoo with good price that would stop my hair from falling. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Only gave 3 stars because of price. Use to getting a deal on Amazon but this shampoo is over priced. I found same for 7.99 at local CVS..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lower 30s yo man. I have been suffering from thinning hair and loosing it for around 10 years. I have tried dozens of products to improve it, from cheap to expensive. The best, most effective thing so far has been Rogaine 5% minoxidil foam. It does make hair grow and stop its falling. Nevertheless, it does little with the thinning hair problem, so even though I do have more hair, I needed something to make it fuller, as to have the same density/coverage in all of my head.&lt;br /&gt;So, based on the linking of this product with Rogaine, and the good reviews it has, I decided to give it a try, In spite of its high price ($43, including s/h), which is expensive to me. Few days after I started using it, I noticed plenty of hairs on my hands when lathering it up on my head, similar to my worst days of hair loosing, before using Rogaine. Because of the excellent reviews and the high cost I paid, I kinda ignored it, thought maybe was normal at the beginning. I continued using it for the same reasons up to 1 month, and the same kept happening, until I decided to stop using it. I did notice some increase in hair thickness, so maybe it&#x27;s suitable for some people and not others.&lt;br /&gt;So now, I have less hair and less money. I&#x27;m sticking with my normal routine again; Rogaine, Johnson&#x27;s Tear Free Baby Shampoo, and 1 Vitamin E 400 IU capsule per day.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I did see some increase in thickness, so I&#x27;d only recommend this product to people who can afford it&#x27;s high price and don&#x27;t mind loosing hair when trying it, because maybe some people don&#x27;t loose their hair when using it like I did.</li>
    <li> It works very well u can see the different and feel it to wish the retail stores will sell it but they don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> since i found this.i only use this shampoo. it does what it says.i highly recomend this. no dissapointments on the quality. this is my secound order.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and would not recommend it. It dried out my hair and I did not see any improvement in my hair. I should have known because its only a shampoo and like most shampoos it will only clean the hair. What would help is if they come out with a shampoo + conditioner version so that it can clean an treat your hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  My hair is very curly, but baby fine.  I started using this product after going through a period of heavy shedding and hair loss (which has stopped now, thank goodness).  It is the best thickening shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - hands down!  And, big bonus, it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair.  It smells great and leaves my hair feeling so soft, and never dries it out.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo made it look like I had 3 times the hair that I have.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Can not be found in my small town&lt;br /&gt;Husband will use no other shampoo!</li>
    <li> IT IS AS GOOD AS ANY &amp;#34;FINE HAIR THICKENING SHAMPOO&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NO BETTER, NOR NO WORSE THAN PANTENE&#x27;S NEW LINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT SAID? I STILL HAVE THIN HAIR THAT LOOK LIKE THIN HAIR.</li>
    <li> Did not purchase this item.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  I really do feel like my hair feels thicker.  My hairdresser even noticed.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Not a bad Shampoo, can&#x27;t really tell the difference in my hair to be honest. My hair is growing really thin up there so I needed to try something different. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again...but hey, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52, have some thinning hair, and use this in concert with Rogaine and it really does the trick.  Adds thickness and volume to your hair without making it feel greasy or &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34;.  I use it everyday and a little goes a long way.  You can&#x27;t beat it for effectiveness and the price is a LOT cheaper than salon products that don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair.  Greasy feel rather than fluffy.</li>
    <li> This is excellent shampoo for thin hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Thank heaven for Amazon.com because I no longer can find this product on any store shelf!(Why do they always do that?) It can dry your hair out a little so I use a light conditioner. I would give it another star if it would just grow hair. Ha! Ha!</li>
    <li> Have used it for a few years.  Stores I bought it at stopped carrying it as the price when up a considerable amount.  Got it on line, but think I will switch to something more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair. I used this consistently for a month or two with no difference. This product did not seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 years. This is a great product! It really help to make your hair look thicker and it is very genital on hair that is falling out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 and my hair isn&#x27;t thinning or balding but it is pretty naturally thin.  I had been using normal shampoo and conditioner and it was not thick at all and I have medium length hair that comes down a little past my eyebrows.  I could see my forehead uncovered by strands of hair.  Finally i saw this at cvs and picked it up and my hair has gotten noticeably thicker when i use this product.  Its good for ppl with just thin hair.. if your hair is incredibly thin and your almost at the combover stage, id say go with something more intense.</li>
    <li> OK product. Smells good and feels good. However, I did not notice a difference between this shampoo and others that are much cheaper. I would buy again only for about half the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo that cleans very well, smells great, and is gentle on the hair. Have been using for years. Impossible to find in mainstream stores anymore, but able to on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It delivers on it&#x27;s promise and I found it even better than Nexxus Volumizing Shampoo. It cleans thoroughly as well and I have almost no dandruff with this as opposed to Nexxus which leave my scalp very dry. I&#x27;m sticking to this!</li>
    <li> Really works!  I have pretty thin hair in the front and I noticed an improvement after a week or so of using this.</li>
    <li> my housband use this shampoo for his hair lost, he like it and stop it.  I think is very usefull.</li>
    <li> Use it for first time and waiting for results. Lets see whats next. Buy it!!! and see if its works on you.</li>
    <li> It helps my fair from falling out. I wish the company had not discontinued this product. Now, I have to pay a lot of money to get it.</li>
    <li> I hate they stopped making this product. I loved this stuff. Makes your hair look so much thicker. If anyone finds a similar product that is not as outrageously expensive then please let me know!</li>
    <li> This product really works! My hair was really flat but Progain makes it more valumized. However, I stopped using it just one day my hair went back to flat so you have to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference AT ALL, and I used for several months, it isn&#x27;t any different from any other shampoo out there. Wodn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought Progaine Volumizing Shampoo based on other reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all the other indignities suffered as I age (gravity, wrinkles and being called \\&quot;Maam\\&quot;), my already thin and fine hair getting thinner and finer to the point of showing a significant amount of blazingly white scalp was just plain old unacceptable.  I didn&#x27;t sign up for this and I&#x27;m not submitting without making a stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo really does make your hair fluffier and consequently gives the impression of being fuller.  I really am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also get a weightless conditioner to use with this shampoo as was recommended by other reviewers.  I&#x27;m glad I paid attention to reviews as I do think the Progaine shampoo may have really dried out my hair without the weightless conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try - you should find out immediately if it&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair but this product really makes it look thicker and stronger.  Little expensive but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good at controlling hair fall. Good for thinning hair. It doesn&#x27;t really make your hair grow but pretty good for general use. Can supplement with other products (minoxidil or DHT blocker) to cater for overall hair care. Value for money.</li>
    <li> Ten Stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an Uncle who went bald at an early age and tried everything to restore his hair.  He never mentioned this product.  It will NOT regrow hair, but it will take the hair that you do have and make it thicker and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the product works when your Barber asks - &amp;#34;What have you been using on your hair?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results using this shampoo that would cause me to want to endorse it to anyone else.  Thinning hair sucks and so does this shampoo.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you - I was balding on top of my head and noticed it in a photo in 2004.  I immediately started using this product and have never stopped using it - and am no longer balding in that spot!  I think that it works if you stick with it; I&#x27;ve been using it since 2004 and I have my full head of hair and no longer am balding - you just have to keep using it and don&#x27;t expect miracles in weeks, but rather do a comparison after 6 months or a year - just keep using it!!!  It really works!!!</li>
    <li> Always helps my hair feel thicker and fuller, while at the same time not drying it out. If your hair feels flat, I recomend it.</li>
    <li> I have thin, oily hair and this shampoo is one of the few things I can buy that makes it look thicker and gives it body.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long yet, so far about 1 month,  but I like works well for Volume.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this shampoo did not give much volume.&lt;br /&gt;I have used some volumizing shampoo that does give your volume&lt;br /&gt;but this was not one of them.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it was less painful and easier to use than the liquid form of medication.  I&#x27;m not seeing any hair growth improvements but it does keep my hair clean.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo for cleaning my hair.  It did nothing to make my hair fuller or have more volume</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years and think it is a good shampoo but I am dissapointed that the price of the product went up over double when I ordered it last in the last few months, it will keep me from buying it anymore unless the price goes back to half of what is being charged now. Thank you</li>
    <li> This shampoo is okay.  It&#x27;s kinda pricey considering it didn&#x27;t add any significant volume to my hair or make it feel any thicker.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom who has terribly thinning hair.  Not a miracle worker, but I have noticed slight volume.  After taking out rollers, hair is very, very soft too.  We will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo on amazon last year. I like it quite a bit. It creates a very rich lather and doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh. As for its hair restorative qualities, well it has none. But as far as shampoos go, I think it is more beneficial to thinning hair than your everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but about 6 months ago this went from $6 a bottle to about $20 a bottle on amazon. Doing a simple web search I found that just about ever vendor of this shampoo on the web did the same price hike. The single vendor that didn&#x27;t was CVS. This isn&#x27;t a CVS plug (except for being able to buy Progaine I couldn&#x27;t care less about CVS), do a web search and look for yourself. They had a 15-25% off promo code (found elsewhere online) that was applied to my order as well (I&#x27;m guessing that codes like this are easily and frequently found for CVS). Anyways I just ordered 9 bottles of Prograine with shipping included for $52.34. I just wanted to pass this tidbit of information along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for it.... it is only shampoo after all.</li>
    <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works, smells great and actually soothes the scalp. I am amazed yet pleased with the price, the size of the bottle, and the way it works. I have been struggling with hair loss and now, starting to notice a change. My hair is actually starting to grow fuller and thicker than before and I am so pleased!</li>
    <li> have used it before but could not find it in any styore around here. was glad you had it at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just regular shampoo being marketed by the makers of Rogaine...there is nothing special about it aside from it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Only leaves the hair soft and a little more volume</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be buying shampoo online, but it seems Amazon is the only convenient place \\&quot;near me\\&quot; that carries this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine (the makers of this shampoo). Since Rogaine is on of the few companies that has proof their product works for hair loss, I trust this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars since I still got a bald spot. 5 stars when I get a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Neova Tricomin and I&#x27;m trying that one after a year of using this one, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re both really good, but I like the other one better because it has conditioner in it.</li>
    <li> I used this for almost a year--mostly because I don&#x27;t have much hair--and I don&#x27;t think it worked at all. The price speaks for itself. It would also leave red stains in the shower, and after 8 months started to smell sulfur-y. Save your money for a better shampoo</li>
    <li> I have long thin wavy hair; makes my hair &amp;#34;FULL&amp;#34; and ringlets!&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous. Will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making available.</li>
    <li> I like this product so much no more hair loss no dandruff, help to restore your hair. . . .</li>
    <li> My wife developed a bald spot at the back of her head due to styling. Her hair is long but thin so that when her hair is combed back, the bald spot becomes visible when the hair blows. She bought the progaine volumizing shampoo and was extremely impressed by this product. It makes her hair look three times thicker than it actually is and actually conceals the bald spot. She says her hair feels fluffy and light after using the shampoo and the thickness lasts for about three to four days. We only gave four stars because the downfall is that it dries out the hair a lot and the conditioner is no longer available on amazon. Oh - my wife is of african descent and has relaxed hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> Organix works better and it ain&#x27;t 100 a bottle Organix purple bottle full and thick with vitamin B7 best shampoo I ever used</li>
    <li> Not bad , not good , nothing to say ................. I think maybe you can choice other one if you want to keep your hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and losing my hair at a young age due to heredity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I went to a hotel about a month ago and noticed after I took a shower there my hair looker so much fuller as if I hadn&#x27;t lost any and my fine hairs looked great. I later figured it was a volumizing shampoo. I needed to get more of this, so I could continue getting those results. When I had got home, my hair was starting to get worse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product on Amazon and had to get it because of the cheap price, and that it is from the makers of rogaine. I used this and noticed similar results to what I got from the one in the hotel. My hair looks better for about a day after I use this. I&#x27;m trying not to use shampoo every day when I shower, but when I don&#x27;t use this my hair looks so much worse. So just note that when you buy this, you need to actually use it to get results, they will all disappear once you stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use the subscribe and save option so you can get a discount and free shipping. At the price, the results you get are more than worth it. Give it a shot if your hairs are thin.</li>
    <li> Not able to find this in stores, so i came to amazon to get it. Sad to say, they raised the price 3 times now, so we going for other products.</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine and this shampoo is giving me volume. Do you have anything that will stimulate texture ?</li>
    <li> save your money. Buy Hair Surge Shampoo if you want results</li>
    <li> love this product, since my hair is thinning, thanks to my older years i was looking for something to add thickness to my hair, i gave this shampoo a try, and to my surprise it worked, makes my hair look thicker, and thats just what i was looking for, a good addition to those like me who also use Progaine foam,</li>
    <li> My hair started to thin about 3 years ago, It&#x27;s long and I do use a hair dryer to flatten and straighten, and I know that&#x27;s not healthy.  But the amount of hair that I had in the drain and on the floor after styling was unreal.  I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and thought maybe this was the reason for the thinning hair.  Well I started to use this shampoo every other day and I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 to 8 weeks now.  I have maybe 5 to 10 hairs in the drain and maybe 5 to 10 while styling compared to about 40 or 50. It&#x27;s growing so fast that the grey is now so visible that I&#x27;m going to have to call my colorist to get it done again. (I used to color it every 8 weeks), now it was 5 weeks and the grey was so visible and the growth that came out showed maybe an inch into my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;In the past few years I have tried so many other products and wasted money.  CVS had their own \\&quot;Store brand\\&quot; of this but I can&#x27;t find it now.  This above shampoo used to come with a conditioner but I think that was discontinued also.&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, try it, but it took about 6 weeks before I really noticed a big improvement.  Be sure to massage this into your scalp.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Product was recommended to help thicken thin, limp hair....just because Rogaine makes it, it should be great, right?....not only did it not thicken my hair, it, actually, made it oily, and even more limp....try something else!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a review on the results, but I really like it so far.</li>
    <li> The price was twice as high as the original product. It was the real thing though. Need to find an inexpensive alternative.</li>
    <li> A great shampoo for cleansing the scalp and removing DHT. Unfortunately, this product is way over priced at over $100.00/bottle. I could get hair transplants for less.</li>
    <li> At 69 thought I had tried everything in the shampoo dept. Basically had given up trying new concepts. No shampoo ever seemed to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had never heard of Progaine until I started using Rogaine in an attempt to stop the thinning on the top of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with what Rogaine did for me in just 3 months I went back to re-order on Amazon.  While re-ordering I caught the link to Progaine and ordered it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only about 3 or 4 days I started noticing a big improvement. Have been using it for about 6 months now. Completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since I was a teenager my fine hair looks full and feels bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THK U Progaine!</li>
    <li> Works great when available.</li>
    <li> Progaine is the best shampoo I have ever used. I Have been using it for about 10 years. I am 65 year old and it really helps.</li>
    <li> Bought a couple of bottled and it seems to give my hair more volume. Will buy a couple more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and can&#x27;t imagine life without it.  One day, my daughter said:  Mom you look so good today,  whatever you did, keep doing it.  Progaine.</li>
    <li> very good product if you are losing your hair go ahead and buy it, it works excellent</li>
    <li> This product works so well and was for a good price. I had subscribed and saved but soo. After I was notified by amazon that my sub n save was being cancelled. They musta caught on to the cheap price I paid for the first order 5.30 and cancelled me. Then when I went back to check price sure enough it was over 10.00 dollars!</li>
    <li> I am an older woman have been using 5% rogaine over a year (under DR&#x27;s supervision) with great results.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for a little more response from this compatible product.  For me it does nothing more than my usual shampoo as I can tell.  If you use Rogaine the shampoo is worth a try.  Maybe you will see some difference.  I will probably order again because of compatible idea.</li>
    <li> Seller did exactly as promised. Product as described. Very happy. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft, managable and it seems to be thicker. It has a great smell and lathers well.  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s much cheaper here than at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair look so thick when it really isnt. I love the smell and it works for me.</li>
    <li> My head and shoulders hair endurance works better than this stuff. Progaine leaves my hair dry and snarly. It really doesn&#x60;t make it any thicker. Won&#x60;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I wont be buying this again...Doesnt thicken my hair...Who knows if its working? I dont know? I take it with Rogaine. i took Propecia for years but its like $90/month and the recent dealbreaker was that they found Propecia can cause permanent sexual problems, so I stopped and started Rogaine and this instead.  I dont really notice anything from this product? If anything you need to start using head and shoulders because Rogaine dries your scalp out so much..</li>
    <li> es un champu excelente,ya me siento mi cabello mas pesado y con mas brillo,y me elimina el cebo cabelludo y sobre todo que contribuye ala caída del pelo.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe amazon is asking for a review on this.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if it works but me dermatologist told me to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am under 40 and don&#x27;t want to lose my hair I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives my limp hair volume! I plan to use this shampoo because for me it does what it says. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic. It makes my hair soft, gives it volume and makes it look fuller. I would recommend this shampoo even for people that don&#x27;t have thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo but it only made my hair fall out more. I noticed the same thing with Aussie shampoo then I went to Finesse and had no problems. If you notice the more expensive shampoos causing problems for you then this product is in the same category.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use rogaine, but this stuff is great for adding a little volume ad doesn&#x27;t over dry your hair either.</li>
</ol>
