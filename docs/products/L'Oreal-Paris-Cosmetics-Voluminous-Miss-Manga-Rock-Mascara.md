      <li>but I don&#x27;t recommend using it for your top lashes</li>
      <li>I think the applicator would be better for your bottom lashes more than your top.</li>
      <li>I use products that separate my lashes and give me more volume.  </li>
      <li>I sooo love this mascara.</li>
      <li>And I am so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>To minimize it, I have been using waterproof mascara PLUS waterproof mascara top coat.</li>
      <li>I got - four lashes on the top and four on the bottom of the eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To make it feel okay for me, I had to use an eyelash curler and a separate eyelash brush to separate my lashes.</li>
      <li>Putting on mascara with this product is quick now, because I don&#x27;t have to put on so many coats!</li>
      <li>I was also able to wash it off easily with soap and water.  </li>
      <li>She said it was super easy to apply and the color was nice.</li>
      <li>Lasts all day long and goes strong,  great mascara, my favorite to date!</li>
      <li>Easy to put on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Applying it was easy.</li>
      <li>find it also comes off really easily with make-up remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to wash off at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product because it&#x27;s a good brand name, but in use I did not like it at all.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily without clumping and looks fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It is inexpensive, makes my eyelashes gorgeous and is so easy to apply without any clumping or smearing and better than my current brand.</li>
      <li>The packaging promises &amp;#34;overloaded volume&amp;#34; and that is certainly an accurate representation of what you&#x27;ll get.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;With a reasonable price and effective use, this is a repeater product even though this was a sample, free product to test for the Vine program.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more economical option and was hoping this mascara would work.  </li>
      <li>The mascara, for the price, is more than worth it.  </li>
      <li>mascara flakes off throughout the day and DON&#x27;T touch your eyes even lightly</li>
      <li>Although the look is great and the mascara itself is of nice quality, the brush making my lashes stick together was not comfortable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M WEARING TOO MUCH EYE MAKEUP&amp;#34;!!!  </li>
      <li>Far too often those trips out involve visiting funeral homes to visit families of loved ones or special friends.  </li>
      <li>The application is quick and easy.</li>
      <li>This is a popular mascara because it gives a high impact look.  </li>
      <li>However, when I applied the mascara it clumped bit, so I had to clean off the brush and apply thinner layers.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely a bold mascara fit for any Manga fan.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply a couple of light coatings which enhanced my lashes without making me look like a comic book</li>
      <li>Miss Manga Rock is just that :  fantastically special for</li>
      <li>Puts a large coating of mascara with each pass, so, if you&#x27;re a first-timer, be sure to practice.</li>
      <li>– it was so much work, that I had mostly stopped using mascara for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also tried scraping the wand and then using a lash comb vertically to just remove a bit of the excess mascara and give a bit more separation, but all of this was just too much work.</li>
      <li>I do not need a primer, it does not smear, dries quickly and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me and just want to quickly apply your makeup and go, this mascara is NOT for you.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Removal - Clean-up was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The packaging and the container look so cool and getting those “manga” lashes are worth trying something</li>
      <li>The mascara is mostly fine, but it very noticeably clumps together.</li>
      <li>- I experienced a little bit of itching around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really not my style, but as I haven&#x27;t recently been very happy with mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, I thought this was worth a try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is a rare case of truth in advertising.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>and the right side shows Miss Manga.</li>
      <li>/&gt;first, it certainly will give you those &#x27;Manga&#x27; eye lashes!</li>
      <li>And lasted, it did wash off easily also, which was unexpected.</li>
      <li>I really think this mascara could be better if it had a better brush, but the brush that&#x27;s in the tube has short, stumpy brush that offers no separation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, but I do try to judge these things fairly), I used this product on my right eye, and opened a new tube of my normal mascara and used it on my left eye.</li>
      <li>Make-up is more a personal preference</li>
      <li>At first I could feel it on my eyelash</li>
      <li>Perfect for a exaggerated glamour look, gothic or rocker chick</li>
      <li>Two swipes and that is more than enough!</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>and they look like they did when I first applied</li>
      <li>Like I said, if you are using fake lashes, this may be the best product out there.</li>
      <li>From what I can tell, it is more of a foam tip with sparse rows of short spikes as opposed to the more traditional bristle brush I am used to.  </li>
      <li>My first thought was</li>
      <li>My first clue should have been the logo for the Spokeswoman of the &amp;#34;Miss Manga Rocks&amp;#34; product line.  </li>
      <li>I am quite pleased that the mascara is made in the United States, so why do we need the directions and promotion in French?</li>
      <li>if L&#x27;Oreal will make a waterproof version, I will be FIRST in line to purchase it.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews prior to selecting this item and it seemed most people did not like it.  </li>
      <li>The Miss Manga mascara actually works better… in many ways.</li>
      <li>the latter, I guess to provide more credibility to its fashion look.  </li>
      <li>However, I just cleaned off under the eyes after the lashes dried and was good to go.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Defines every single lash. Puts a large coating of mascara with each pass, so, if you&#x27;re a first-timer, be sure to practice.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to selecting this item and it seemed most people did not like it.  Make-up is more a personal preference so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the other colors in this line are getting higher reviews so I am confused. My concern with this being black, it might not be dark enough for my eyelashes. I usually buy the darkest color possibly, in the future I will be getting [[ASIN:B00V0XPM0E L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Voluminous Miss Manga Rock Mascara, 387 Blackest Black, 0.27 Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Maybelline girl when it comes to buying mascara. L’Oreal though is a brand I have had good luck with in the past. When I received this mascara I decided to apply it to one eye and go around all day to see the difference. On the other eye I added nothing. Applying it was easy. I love the brush, there is a slight learning curve to getting all the lashes and trying to get them separated. After I looked at my eye and I loved the look. My first thought was if you could spike your eyelashes, this is what you would use. It was not until after I was done I read the ‘spike’ word on the box. If you remember the dolls that had the eyes that opened and closed, it has the doll eyelash look to it. I personally love it! At first I could feel it on my eyelash but once it dried, I can’t tell it is there. I also have sensitive eyes and I have had no reaction to it. I feared it would not be black enough for my really dark lashes but it is. My eyes have not smudged at all and they look like they did when I first applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes off easily with soap and water. I think they are trying to target younger people by adding the ‘rock and rebellious’ to the marketing of the product. I am 41 and thought I might be too young to try this. However, those are just marketing words. The product itself works and looks great. This is something I will definitely be buying!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new Miss Manga eye mascara is exactly what it says it is -- a ton of mascara -- to give you that character type look. If you want to have dark, thickly mascara&#x27;d lashes, this is the stuff for you. It&#x27;s not subtle. You know you are wearing mascara. It went on thick and easily. And lasted, it did wash off easily also, which was unexpected. Interesting mascara. I&#x27;m unsure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The mascara is mostly fine, but it very noticeably clumps together. It does not provide the clear definition I usually get from other products. For that reason, it just didn&#x27;t work well for me. The packaging is very nice.</li>
    <li> Mascara and I have a love/hate relationship lately. I am in my mid-50s, and it seems a lot of me is fading - including my eyebrows and eyelashes! With most of the mascara products today, the wands are extremely thin and the product barely highlights my lashes. I normally have to put on 4 - 5 coats and even my lashes are almost barely there. So frustrating!! I normally try to find mascaras that have a &amp;#34;brushy&amp;#34; wand because that seems to coat my lashes more evenly, but then I have to deal with the potential of clumping. UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when this product came along, I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad that I did. The wand is thin and there are very small &#x27;separators,&#x27; which I initially didn&#x27;t think would work all that well. But I was wrong! The wand does a good job of separating the lashes just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is heavy - for lack of a better term. One swipe with the wand, and my lashes instantly came to life again! Two swipes and that is more than enough! Putting on mascara with this product is quick now, because I don&#x27;t have to put on so many coats! And I look like I have the lashes I did back in my 20s/30s. I would caution that this mascara does go pretty heavy, so starting off slowly is probably best until one is used to it. However, being able to only use one coat, or maybe two, really does save time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it also comes off really easily with make-up remover. I use Neutrogena Oil-Free, and I have no problems, no hard rubbing, etc. This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake during the day and it doesn&#x27;t smudge as other mascaras I&#x27;ve used sometimes do. My only issue (and hence the 4 starts) is that it does take a little bit of time to dry, and that can make little smudge-y marks on eyelids. Once dry, this mascara does not go anywhere - even if my eyes are water-y. This mascara does not seem bother my eyes, cause any redness or irritation, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product is marketed to a younger audience, but I really likethe results I get!</li>
    <li> I like the formula of the mascara it&#x27;s dark and it makes your eyelashes look full. The only problem I have with this product is the wand applicator it tends to clump your eyelashes I think the applicator would be better for your bottom lashes more than your top. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product but I don&#x27;t recommend using it for your top lashes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person. When I do wear it, just some eye shadow and mascara will do it for me. I&#x27;ve seen commercials for this Miss Manga mascara and was curious to know how it was different from regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like this mascara. It&#x27;s bolder than a normal mascara would be. If you want your eyelashes to be noticed, this is for you. Women who want more subtle makeup should look elsewhere. The application is quick and easy. It&#x27;s also easy to wash off at the end of the day. I really like it!</li>
    <li> This product is a rare case of truth in advertising.  The packaging promises &amp;#34;overloaded volume&amp;#34; and that is certainly an accurate representation of what you&#x27;ll get.  My first clue should have been the logo for the Spokeswoman of the &amp;#34;Miss Manga Rocks&amp;#34; product line.  To describe her, I&#x27;d have to say she is is an Anime Glam-rock Panda with an inexplicable set of crossbones (!?!) behind her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is definitely targeted at young women, specifically those seeking the trendy look in fashion today which screams &amp;#34;LOOK AT ME- I&#x27;M WEARING TOO MUCH EYE MAKEUP&amp;#34;!!!  I&#x27; think they achieve this through the novel design of the applicator wand.  From what I can tell, it is more of a foam tip with sparse rows of short spikes as opposed to the more traditional bristle brush I am used to.  To draw a comparison, it is similar to using a roller to apply paint rather than a paintbrush.  You&#x27;ll get twice as much mascara applied in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use make up for a subtle enhancement of what mother nature gave me.  I just want my lashes to be a tad darker and longer than they naturally are to accentuate my eyes.  I have to use this mascara very sparingly to keep it from being too much for my taste.  The actual product is fine; it doesn&#x27;t flake or clump.  It just goes on too heavy for my taste.  But if your goal is to look like an Anime Glam-rock Panda on her way to a rave, this is no doubt the mascara for you!</li>
    <li> So....this mascara does what it promises....but that doesn&#x27;t mean you will like it. If you&#x27;re going for the spikey, overly-separated, I-have-mascara-globbed-on look, this mascara will be your best friend. Otherwise, you&#x27;re not likely to keep it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually was sort of OK with this mascara when I first put it on but within 10-15 minutes, my lashes looked like I had mascara on for 24 hours straight and keep replying it in regular intervals. In other words, they got this dry, spikey, spider-like look to them. This may be in fashion among the younger crowd but it&#x27;s definitely not my thing...</li>
    <li> The picture on the package shows a Manga girl, with four triangular lashes on the top and bottom of her eye. Unfortunately, with the way this product clumped, that&#x27;s about the look I got - four lashes on the top and four on the bottom of the eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day (yeah, I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, but I do try to judge these things fairly), I used this product on my right eye, and opened a new tube of my normal mascara and used it on my left eye. By the end of the day, I got tired of hearing people ask me if I was all right. The Manga mascara made me look as if I had hurt my eye. It didn&#x27;t smudge, it just looked &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; to the people around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give it three stars because it did what it said it would: it didn&#x27;t smudge, didn&#x27;t wear off during the day, and gave me a look just like the one on the package. I can&#x27;t give it more stars because I prefer to look like I have more than eight eyelashes.</li>
    <li> My fiance tried this mascara as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive mascara she normally uses. She said it was super easy to apply and the color was nice. It didn&#x27;t add as much volume as she hoped but it didn&#x27;t clump or leave her with spider lashes. Overall, she wasn&#x27;t blown away, but it did the job.</li>
    <li> this product, according to my in-house tester, is excellent at what it does and provides at least one marked improvement over many other mascaras&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first, it certainly will give you those &#x27;Manga&#x27; eye lashes! however, with a bit of judicious removal, very acceptable (toned down) results may be obtained, thankfully due to the water solvency of the makeup... to quote: &amp;#34;Not every gal wants Tammy Faye Baker eyes&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brush is convenient, ergonomic, and best of all, has a non-rolling extrusion - in other words, it won&#x27;t roll all over a counter! there is plenty of makeup included, so this brush will last for quite some time...</li>
    <li> I am one of those women who is always on the look for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mascara. For the last few years I&#x27;ve used an expensive brand that can only be purchased at fine department stores. So, when I was offered the opportunity to try this mascara, I jumped at it. Let me say... I sooo love this mascara. It is inexpensive, makes my eyelashes gorgeous and is so easy to apply without any clumping or smearing and better than my current brand. The only reason I did not give five stars is because it is NOT waterproof so don&#x27;t apply this if you will be near water, have the potential to cry or sweat... if L&#x27;Oreal will make a waterproof version, I will be FIRST in line to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This was one of my least favorite mascaras unfortunately. Remember Tammy Faye Baker? Imagine the mascara she would&#x27;ve used, and I imagine this would&#x27;ve worked perfectly for her ... although I don&#x27;t think she was striving for the &amp;#34;Manga&amp;#34; look!&lt;br /&gt;On first impressions, when pulling the brush out of the tube, the brush is slathered with thick mascara. I really think this mascara could be better if it had a better brush, but the brush that&#x27;s in the tube has short, stumpy brush that offers no separation. I felt I ended up with a sloppy mess on my lashes, which I didn&#x27;t like at all. Did you ever put on mascara and feel your vision was darker? I felt that way after the first time I applied this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;In order to apply and get any semblance of lash separation, you really have to scrape quite a bit of mascara off of the brush ... if not one&#x27;s lashes would end up not pleasingly covered with mascara - clumpy, gloppy, no definition. When applied it&#x27;s just too thick. I realize this is a volumizing mascara, but there has to be some definition to the lash - if not it doesn&#x27;t enhance anyone&#x27;s eyes!&lt;br /&gt;In order to get any sort of pleasing look, scraping the wand wasn&#x27;t enough. I had to swipe the brush through a paper towel - which I hate to do because mascara should only be in the tube or on the lashes - anywhere else could increase chances for bacteria. However, because this mascara is so thick it couldn&#x27;t be applied straight from the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried scraping the wand and then using a lash comb vertically to just remove a bit of the excess mascara and give a bit more separation, but all of this was just too much work. More work than I&#x27;m used to in a mascara!&lt;br /&gt;One other think I didn&#x27;t like was I found the mascara irritating to my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t take away any stars for this because I do have sensitive eyes and I&#x27;ve found thick mascaras tend to be more irritating because tears, even normal tears make the mascara more susceptible to running into my eyes - so take that with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel I can recommend this mascara because it was just too thick and the brush wasn&#x27;t one I&#x27;d want to use.s - so take that with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel I can recommend this mascara because it was just too thick and the brush wasn&#x27;t one I&#x27;d want to use.</li>
    <li> I’ve been wanting to try this manga mascara for a while now. The packaging and the container look so cool and getting those “manga” lashes are worth trying something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feel: The mascara goes on smooth and clean, but the short little bristles make it clump and feel awkward. To make it feel okay for me, I had to use an eyelash curler and a separate eyelash brush to separate my lashes. I suppose this is the trick to getting manga eyelashes, to stick them together, but it felt very uncomfortable. I can see using this on fake lashes and being okay. The mascara didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but it messed with the lashes so that it was uncomfortable and I kept messing with them all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Look: There is definitely a very graphic, manga look when wearing this mascara. After putting some on one eye and not the other, I observed my eye looked more open and alert. A few observers that did not know what I had put on it, said one eye looked awake and the other asleep. So the look, is definitely a plus if you want that big lash feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I won’t be getting this again. Although the look is great and the mascara itself is of nice quality, the brush making my lashes stick together was not comfortable. I don’t want a mascara I have to use two other products to apply. Like I said, if you are using fake lashes, this may be the best product out there.</li>
    <li> I usually use Benefits &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real Mascara&amp;#34; or Tarte&#x27;s &amp;#34;Light&#x27;s Camera, Flashes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a more economical option and was hoping this mascara would work.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush - is spiked which helps to extend the lashes nicely.  The rows of &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; are wide so the brush holds a lot of mascara.  This allows for a thick application. However, when I applied the mascara it clumped bit, so I had to clean off the brush and apply thinner layers.  This worked well because I could go for a subtle look or simply apply more layers for a more dramatic and bold look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flaking/Smudging - I experienced some smudging and ALOT of flaking.  I was extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity - I experienced a little bit of itching around my eyes.  However, I am have sensitive skin so this may not be an issue for other users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal - Clean-up was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly would not purchase this mascara or recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the wand are spaced pretty far apart so it picks up a lot of mascara (as you can see in the picture), they are also too far apart to separate the lashes, causing it to go on clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara flakes off throughout the day and DON&#x27;T touch your eyes even lightly or you&#x27;ll look like a raccoon.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a reader of the anime or manga comics but I have seen illustrations and thought I had a pretty good idea of what Miss Manga might mean: heavy, thickly applied mascara to form spiky lashes That&#x27;s really not my style, but as I haven&#x27;t recently been very happy with mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, I thought this was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a L&#x27;Oreal product fan, and I&#x27;m quite pleased to say this mascara is not what I expected, in a very positive way. It wasn&#x27;t thick or clumpy, my lashes didn&#x27;t form into dangerous looking spikes.  I really like the brush and it&#x27;s easy to apply a couple of light coatings which enhanced my lashes without making me look like a comic book heroine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This washed/wiped off easily with a little coconut oil on a cotton pad. So far very happy with this mascara and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few more months, I am amending my review to 4 stars.  The mascara, for the price, is more than worth it.  I do not need a primer, it does not smear, dries quickly and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always purchase mascara to create more volume and only use black (or Noir if they want to pretend they are French).  I applied the product per the instructions.  I had to be careful when I retrieved the mascara from its paper and plastic to avoid tearing into the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are written in English and French, the latter, I guess to provide more credibility to its fashion look.  I thought I would be loaded with heavy mascara, but after the application, it did not look heavy. However,  I could feel it on my lashes all the time, which made me wary of the weight.  I use products that separate my lashes and give me more volume.  However, those mascaras are at least five times more expensive, but it is my eyes, and I’m careful. Miss Manga Rock is acceptable but I don’t think it lived up to its hype. It’s a bit cheapie looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state that the product can be removed with soap and water.  I wouldn’t take that chance and used a gentle mascara remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L’OREAL apparently owns many cosmetic companies from low to high end salon products.  Miss Manga Rock is probably one of their lower end products designed for the younger woman or one who really wants her eyelashes to make a statement.  I am quite pleased that the mascara is made in the United States, so why do we need the directions and promotion in French?</li>
    <li> Gives your eyelashes flair!  Lasts all day long and goes strong,  great mascara, my favorite to date! I love the cute packaging as well!</li>
    <li> Nice packaging. Great mascara. Super bad brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the brush are stubby, and if you really want clumpy lash spikes then this mascara is for you.  If you prefer fuller, defined lashes, skip this product.  Or do what I did; switch out the wand.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  This review was written by my wife!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wear mascara again!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my eyes are watery. Maybe my face is too flat. Maybe my eyelashes are too straight. For whatever reasons, no matter what mascara I use, I always find the bottom area of my eyes blackened at the end of day when I wear mascara. To minimize it, I have been using waterproof mascara PLUS waterproof mascara top coat. I tried different types of mascaras including some that dissolves in warm water but not in cold water, but they dissolved right underneath my eyes. The Miss Manga mascara dissolves even in cold water…so I thought, ‘Yeah right, I will look horrible very soon if I use something like this!’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all! The Miss Manga mascara actually works better… in many ways. It does not darken below my eyes at the end of day when I wear it in the morning…it works better than waterproof mascara plus waterproof mascara top coat! The combination I formerly used are not inexpensive…Lancôme L’extreme waterproof ($27.50, discontinued) with Clarins Double Fix&#x27; Mascara ($24). Still, they somehow darken below my eyes. My Miss Manga rock mascara version (this Amazon review section seem to contain both waterproof and non-waterproof version it seems) is not even waterproof! The Miss Manga mascara is easy to remove after rinsing my eyes with cold tap water, it just comes off as advertised! My old mascara set, on the other hand, is pain to remove, because both the mascara and top coat are waterproof!  And the set required a special mascara-shaped mascara remover that I need to leave on my eyelashes for few minutes before wiping off with a Kleenex – it was so much work, that I had mostly stopped using mascara for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually NOT the only benefit of this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;The Lancôme L’extreme mascara is a ‘Lengthening’ type, I believe, but Miss Manga actually gives me longer length on my mascara.  In the photo, the left side shows L’extreme and the right side shows Miss Manga. The photo also shows it not ‘Separating’ mascara (as advertised), and I guess it really depends on your preferences, but I like the look personally. And Miss Manga is not flaky, which may contribute to the fact that I don’t get darker lower eyelid, and because it does not irritate my eyes, they don’t get watery any more!  Great value!  Highly recommended!t side shows Miss Manga. The photo also shows it not ‘Separating’ mascara (as advertised), and I guess it really depends on your preferences, but I like the look personally.

    <li> This is a popular mascara because it gives a high impact look.  Formula is very black and thick.  So thought I&#x27;d try this as, being a certain age, my lashes have thinned out a LOT.  They&#x27;re barely there.  However, this is a mascara that takes some work to get optimumal results.  If you&#x27;re like me and just want to quickly apply your makeup and go, this mascara is NOT for you.  The issue is stuff applies very THICKLY, so it&#x27;s highly recommended that you &amp;#34;comb out&amp;#34; the mascara to work it through.  Do this with an old mascara brush or an eyebrow comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Manga is a good product for a night out when you intend to take the time to present a perfect face or for those girls who enjoy fussing with their makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product with one issue.  The wand is flimsy and it feels really weird in your hand.  It is good for under your eyes but on top of your eyes it doesnt work as well and clumps eyelashes.  The formula is really good though and does what it is supposed to do.  All in all a potentially solid product that needs a little tweeking.  It is for the younger crowd as well.  The</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  It goes on easily without clumping and looks fantastic.  The perfect shade of black this gives the perfect lash separation and a nice length.  This is definitely a bold mascara fit for any Manga fan.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of mascara to get a noticeable, babydoll look with this one.  It washes off nicely, too.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Judy here; not John.  He heard he could fix his computer and is driving me crazy, as usual.  I am here to praise L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Miss Manga Rock Mascara.  It is seldom that I wear mascara now that I am among many other senior folks.  When I do wear it, I want it to be extra special and Miss Manga Rock is just that :  fantastically special for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof is a big factor.  I hate any product that runs after application and Miss Manga does not run after it is dry.  Far too often those trips out involve visiting funeral homes to visit families of loved ones or special friends.  No runny black mascara on the face.  I do have to be careful, however, since if used as directed I can almost look like a heavy metal rocker with spiky lashes.  Now, that is some sight to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a reasonable price and effective use, this is a repeater product even though this was a sample, free product to test for the Vine program.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because it&#x27;s a good brand name, but in use I did not like it at all.  It definitely adds length to your lashes, but with that comes just huge ugly clumps.  Not worth it, you can do better.</li>
    <li> This mascara is incredibly bold and long lasting.  Perfect for a exaggerated glamour look, gothic or rocker chick look.  Easy to put on. Durable longevity.</li>
    <li> This mascara beats out any others that I&#x27;ve tried because it goes on thick without being clumpy and that is exactly what I was looking for. The applicator is a &amp;#34;spiked&amp;#34; flexible plastic wand and does not have any brush bristles like typical mascaras. This enabled me to apply a thick coating to my lashes. What I also love is that it lasted all day (about 17 hours) and did not flake off yet  I was also able to wash it off easily with soap and water.  According to the packaging, this is also suitable for contact lens wearers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage I experienced  is that some mascara wore off onto the skin below my eye while it was drying. This was almost impossible to avoid even if I stared straight ahead for a minute or two. However, I just cleaned off under the eyes after the lashes dried and was good to go.  I&#x27;ll take that disadvantage any day for full thick lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, even though I&#x27;m middle-aged, I like my mascara thick. Thick lashes are important to me because I wear glasses and this enables them to be seen beyond the lenses. This L&#x27;Oreal blackest black mascara will now be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; choice.  I wish they also sold this in Royal Blue  so that I do not have to purchase that color from Maybelline.</li>
    <li> Not for the faint of heart (or those who work in a stuffier environment) but a lot of fun for a different look. It&#x27;s dried fast and wasn&#x27;t particularly difficult to remove with my eye makeup remover. Not sure it&#x27;s the look for me but it did make my eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
