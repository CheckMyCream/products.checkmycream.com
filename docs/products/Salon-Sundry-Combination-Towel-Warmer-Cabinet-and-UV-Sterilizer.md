<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sticker on front of machine is upside down. Power on button turned red when first turned on, uv button turned red when on, but 2nd time turned on the power on button will no longer light up.</li>
    <li> Heat fast and works great. Good price. Only last for ~ one year</li>
    <li> only 7 months, it &#x27;s broken.</li>
    <li> Was a wonderful accent to our buisness.</li>
    <li> Nice, but gets a little too hot, will use it anyway, better than not hot enough</li>
    <li> The towel warmer is perfect. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is my second towel warmer and they both have a terrible odor that won&#x27;t go away!</li>
    <li> I got the unit and it didn&#x27;t work. I had to go buy a new fuse to make it work.  Not good business. Will not order anything electrical from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Wife putting hot towels on everyone. She loves ut. Best gift ever. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Its crap!!! Did not heat at all!!! DOES NOT WORK AND ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BRAND NEW! Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> It is perfect for about 40 hand towels and it stays the perfect temperature.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. Great deal for the price. Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Overall I am very pleased with this unit. The only draw back so far is not being able to adjust the heat. It really had no instructions but did note you can adjust the heat. I am either overlooking this feature on the unit or it is not adjustable.</li>
    <li> It was good for about a week. After a week the heater in it died, which rendered it useless. They promptly refunded the item price.</li>
    <li> Both units do not work. I am sending them back just waiting to get a box big enough because they want it to be packaged the same as it came to me...</li>
    <li> 2nd. time I purchased this item. Lasted about 3 months and both are not working and will not  heat up. Terrible quality as expected from China .Does not last. Opened product up and terrible burning odour from inside both units. I am not sure how this product passed inspection to get into this country. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Towel cabi unit was inconsistent with temperature control, ran too hot then not at all. stopped working after 90 days .&lt;br /&gt;Mix wholesale would not replace , warranty is 60 days!  Do NOT purchase !!!</li>
    <li> When this warmer gets warms it has a metalic odor due to breakdown from moisture and it does rust.  A better quality inner lining should be applied to keep this from happening.  It also causes the towels to &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works well but came with dents in the side....</li>
    <li> I use this towel warmer in my massage therapy business and it works exceptionally well. It holds 12 hand towels easily. If you plan to use washcloths, it would hold more. UV feature is a plus with this warmer to kill bacteria. Very light weight so no stress on your part if you need to move it around the room. Takes up about as much space as a hot stone warmer that is large, maybe a slight difference. It does have a rack that comes with the unit and fits nicely inside. It has a pull out water drain that needs to be checked after each use and cleaned, but super easy to do. It warms up quickly and gets the job done. I would advise using something to get the towels out of the warmer because it can get hot. I recommend this item for quality and exceptional price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge though. ..definitely not the average size. ..equivalent to the size of a microwave</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t hold the amount of towels described. It does get super hot, however mine leaks water. Has a bad industrial smell that still has not gone away. :(</li>
    <li> I am a medical massage therapist who was looking for a small and simple towel warming cabinet with UV for under $100.  It also includes a rack so that the air circulates better. My only complaint is the cord is a bit shorter than I would have liked, and it has a strong plastic smell which I hope goes away soon. I plugged it in and used it all day at work today and it heats quickly and evenly. Only complain today is the strong chemical plastic smell.</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday.  The Amazon info states made in the USA.  The sticker on the back of the warmer states made in China.  The quality of this product is horrible.  The rubber seal is loose and the drip tray does not fit correctly.  I did not even try to plug it in, afraid to use it.  There is no customer service number on the one page instruction sheet and no info at all on replacing the UV element.  This is going back immediately.</li>
    <li> Clean and simple design. Fits just the right amount of towels!</li>
    <li> Great small size hot towel cabi for whatever your spa profession is. Small jobs like facials or massage are perfect companion to any size room. Gets very hot and fast.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. It will only last 6-7 months and then broken no heat at all. I recommend you to pay extra for a better product. The customer service is useless and they offer little to none on how to solve this issue. No responsibility.</li>
    <li> This warmer works great. I use it for my massage business and it heats the towels up great. My towels are a little thick so I can only fit about 4 of them but I still like it.</li>
    <li> horrible smell still has not gone away</li>
    <li> Great Condition. Appears to be working well at this time.</li>
    <li> Love my new towel warmer after washing your face &amp; apply a hot steam towel it feels amazing. &amp; was shipped very quick !</li>
    <li> Great product does exactly what it suppost to do and very simple to use...little long so need some kind of table or long flat surface to place it on</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of them and only 3 worked. One wouldn&#x27;t even turn on and the other the light flickered on and off.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, but rubber sealant inside door is very loose and collects lots of water. You have to be super vigilant with wiping away water after each use. Otherwise, no other problems. The burning smell dissipated after the first use.</li>
    <li> I felt the towel warmer was not very sturdy but more than that, it gets the towels too hot.  And I&#x27;ve attempted several times to clean the unpleasant smell out that it had when I received it.</li>
    <li> Awesome towel warmer.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I noticed it&#x27;s taking a lot longer to heat things up now that I have added more neck pillows and such to be heated up in it.  The towels get pretty darn hot, probably because of the water in them.  I agree the smell is a bit off-putting but it&#x27;s not so bad that I am going to return it.  I do think it is pretty small and as my practice grows I will have to get a different one.  I think this product looks chinsy and not very well made but the price was unbeatable so for now it gets the job done.  I may take it and use it at home when I get a better, bigger one for my office :-)</li>
    <li> Bad smell. Won&#x27;t go away. Not well made, but works if u want hot stinky towels. UV light works from what I can see.</li>
    <li> I purchased this towel warmer less than a year ago and used it only a few times per week and it no longer works. It seems products only work for a few months these days. They should be less expensive if they&#x27;re going to be made so poorly. Attempting to reach out to the seller for resolution.</li>
    <li> Has weird smell to it when uv light is on.</li>
    <li> Lasted one month and a day so now it&#x27;s not returnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it made the towels super hot and it still does, but water is now leaking out of the back leaving a pool of water behind it with a nice rust stain to it.  It drips out the back more so than it does the front where the drip tray is.  I&#x27;ve got a towel under it and I&#x27;ll have to deal with this until I get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about the machine is that the exterior has been always been hot.  I could understand being warm, but I think insulation is lacking.  The gray rubber strip around the inside between the door and unit has been peeling off since the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a really cheaply made product that pooped out on me in 31 days.  Spend more money on something with a good return policy and will last you for years and years of service.  Cry once, not at least twice like me and purchase something better.</li>
    <li> I am returning this device. It has a horrendous odor that will not fade away. It appears that the rubber that is lining it is about to start coming off and its brand new. The metal or whatever lines the insides is so very thin and does not insulate well. Cheap. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I tried to return it but I have to pay the shipping.  I don&#x27;t want to spend money for nothing. I don&#x27;t really need the towel warmer, what I want to actually purchase is the sterilizer. But since it is both a warmer and sterilizer, I thought I can use it for both the towel and the tools/implements.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our needs and great price  it was just what we needed to complete our facial room . Could be used in all areas of the salon</li>
    <li> Settled on a 4 because towels are much hotter in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More uniform heat distribution would have made it a 5.</li>
    <li> Had for less then one year and it no longer works.  Can only return for one month, so beware!</li>
    <li> Heats up quick. Quiet. It does stink a fair bit when I turn it on. Have tried cleaning with tea tree, etc. still stinks. Others in the industry assure me this will go away.</li>
    <li> Received the item yesterday. Noticed immediately that the quality was not as good as the other warmers I&#x27;ve had in the past. Plugged it in and noticed a horrible odor emitting from it, like a plastic burning smell. Seal on the door was very loose too! Felt like thise thing was not going to hold up. But I should have known that from this price point.. Returned it right away with no troubles through Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.</li>
    <li> Use this when I am doing massages on clients, they love the hot towels and the machine gets them to a perfect temperature so that they are not too hot for a persons skin, but warm enough to remove the oil. I also love the UV sterilizer because it keeps the towels nice and fresh!</li>
    <li> It does stink and takes about a week to get rid of the fishy smell. I liked it fine until it stopped working in February.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our daughter and she really likes it and has no complain with it. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> The warmer works well. The seal on the door is very cheap so hoping it stays attached.</li>
    <li> just got the unit, only have used once, but it heated effectively. the flashing around the door is thin, misshapen and speaks to the cheap quality of this unit, but i don&#x27;t plan on using it too often, so hopefully it&#x27;s worth the cheap price point. fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> it stinks, and it doesn&#x27;t get better with time. do not buy this one. the heat temperature and light are good.</li>
    <li> it dose not work plugged it in and it does&#x27;nt turn. Please advise</li>
    <li> Having a hot towel adds to the perfect shave!  I recommend this product for any man who appreciates a hot lather shave or spa facial.</li>
    <li> This cabinet holds about 12 regular sized facial towels.  It needs about 45 mins to heat up, especially if its full. It has a tight seal when the door is shut and stays hot all day if necessary.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Heats up VERY quickly and works well</li>
    <li> Have been using this for quite some time and it is perfect for me. I provide skin care and the towels come out just the right temperature not scalding hot. Reasonable price. It doesn&#x27;t hold a huge amount of towels so for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; that could be a problem. Otherwise I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it and so do my custumers,when I put a warm towel on there legs,they say its the best part</li>
    <li> Works just as expected very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this towel warmer. It replaces my 9month old towel warmer.  The same brand and design. I was hoping that it would last longer but i guess you get what you get.</li>
    <li> As an aesthetician I was looking for a small but powerful heating towel warmer.  After reading many reviews and looking and different ones, this rose to the top.  I have been very satisfied and happy with it.</li>
    <li> The item capacity was stated as &#x27;•Capacity up to 40 towels at once (depending on towel size)&#x27;.  This is entirely misstated, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I tried putting towels in it and in no way can you get ever 40 wash cloths (12x12) let alone 40 standard (15x25) hand towels which is the standard size used in spas.  I was only able to get 2 rows of 5 (10 total) wet towels in it.  Also, you stated it was made in the USA but it says China on the back side.  I will try it tomorrow and if it smells I will be returning it!</li>
    <li> Love using my towel warmer.  Very easy to operate and the towels get heated quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t make any noise, and is a great size.</li>
    <li> i have had this Towel warmer in my business for 1 week and it works great. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> :) space saver and perfect for the job. My patients love the hot towel treatment therapy. better and more sanitary than the hydroculator pad!!</li>
    <li> My wife has a beauty salon. we ordered this to warm towels and sanitize items . We have tried it out and it seems to work quite well.</li>
    <li> We purchased 4 of these for our office back in February 2013.  We did not start using them until mid-March.  For the first couple of months, they were fine.  Then, about two weeks ago, while doing routine maintenance on our office equipment, we noticed that ALL 4 of the units we purchased have large cracks in the corners of the inside chambers. And last week, one of them stopped working entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We emailed Mix Wholesale, who responded asking for the order numbers (which we&#x27;d supplied in the original email). We responded immediately, and two days later (today) we got a response that the units were out of warranty, and \\&quot;as a courtesy\\&quot; that if we paid shipping *both ways* to Florida (we&#x27;re in California), they would repair them.  The shipping cost would exceed the cost of the units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bad enough when a company sells a shoddy product, and when we have 4 units with the exact same problem, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that the product is shoddy.  It&#x27;s even worse when the company, which claims to pride itself on customer service, offers no support on products that are intended for professional use, but last less than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly advise avoiding both this product AND Mix Wholesale.</li>
    <li> When I received my first order of this product, I was shocked at the poor quality.  There were black scratches all over it and finger smudges.  It seemed like it had been used before, there is no way it was new.  Then, when I plugged it in, it gave off a terrible smell.  I figured this was just a fluke and returned it thinking they would send me a new one.  I was disappointed when the next one I got also seemed used.  I gave up and have kept it but even after 6 months, my towels have a bad smell to them after warming them up in this.</li>
    <li> Works fine, heats quickly.  I wish it weren&#x27;t white though, because it sticks out like a sore thumb in my massage room!! would be less conspicuous if it were stainless or even black.  However, functions well, and I appreciate that the most!</li>
    <li> The on/off switch must have a short it doesn&#x27;t work right. This is the second one I have of this brand and it just doesn&#x27;t hold up for professional use</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and with the results!!!</li>
    <li> This works good getting towels and stones hot, but there is a horrible chokeing toxic smell/ fume that is coming from the warmer after I turned it on. I have cleaned and cleaned it, bleached it, used hospital strength clenser on it and nothing gets rid of this horrible smell. I should have just bought a more expensive warmer form Massage Wharehouse and saved my time and money. Going to return this.</li>
    <li> Good product, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> This unit continues to work well.  It&#x27;s weight is a little light causing the unit to move on table when you open the door.&lt;br /&gt;Heats quick and temperature is consistent and good</li>
    <li> i bought this for my massage business hoping to add a great feature for the northeastern winters we have. It is great! Towels come out very warm. I have not used the &amp;#34;crock pot&amp;#34; method but the lady I partnered with has used that method and she said that sometimes the towels are unevenly heated. I did not get that from this. I will however say that it is small. AND the ultra violet light did &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; or lighten my new towels. So I bought more new White Towels. Otherwise A handy unit for my massage room that should last a long time. Also, prop the door open at night or when done to let it air out. There is a lot of condensation.</li>
    <li> The UV Light never worked. And it stopped working completely after 4 months. Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> Light went out within a week but heater still works</li>
    <li> The towel warmer stopped working after 10 months. It wouldn&#x27;t heat anymore.</li>
    <li> Even after reading the bad reviews, we still took a chance and ordered it. We haven&#x27;t used it yet in our massage practice because of the smell of the chemical stench from the rubber seals. We are trying to air it out, (It&#x27;s been almost a month.), because we really liked the larger size, but may have to see how to return it, and order a more expensive one that doesn&#x27;t smell noxious and toxic like this one. The towels we used for test runs even smelled like the rubber seals! We feel that it&#x27;s not even close to promoting the relaxing experience that our clients have have grown accustomed to enjoying. We liked the price for the unit, which is why we were swayed to purchase it, in spite of the bad reviews. But since it can&#x27;t be used for the intended purpose, it&#x27;s turned into a waste of money. Learn from our mistake: Save your valuable time and money and buy something else. P.S.Unfortunately, we cannot return the towel warmer because we ordered it 32 days ago, and returns expire after 30 days. We were packing it to return and also discovered rust on the inside from just a few trial runs!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second towel warmer and i love it. Far more superior product than my other warmer which is made by Success. Do not buy Success! I would buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Not good.&lt;br /&gt;Did not work.  UV light comes on.  No heat.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Great product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work when i got it, doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. And they wouldn&#x27;t let me return it.</li>
    <li> I empty and dry the cabinet every end of the evening. Only use it for a month and the inside is rusting already.</li>
    <li> If I could rate this at zero stars, I would. The inner seal has completely come apart less than a year after purchase, there has been a disgusting odor and brown color developed that I cannot scrub away or bleach out. I clean the machine every single night and it is disgusting. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I now have to buy a new towel warmer from a reputable source after less than a year.</li>
    <li> my unit has a seal around the door that is already looking loose. the unit wobbles too. i just bought this and have used it only once. would not get it again. its cheaply made and very small inside. i was thinking it could hold at least 8 towels and it barely takes 5. not happy with this purchase. not practical for esthetics! cat</li>
    <li> the cabinet looks good and works good. the instructions are hard to understands. seems like they were translated from chinese to english by a computer software.</li>
    <li> stopped working in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> HEATS UP FAST JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT OR IT WILL SCORCH YOU LOL WONDERFUL PRODUCT WILL RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional esthetician and this unit was the perfect choice for my practice. It&#x27;s roomy, allowing plenty of storage space for warm towels, and you also  have the added bonus of UV sterilization should you choose to utilize that aspect of the warmer. Arrived quickly in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once.  So far, so good.  I find it much better than conventional towel warmers that take at least 20 minutes of lead time to warm up &amp; I think use much more electricity.  Is there a larger model?</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year in my massage practice and it has done very well.  Very good value for the price.  I was able to put in about 4-6 hand towels and 4-6 washcloths at the same time.  I never tried to heat large towels, though.  I highly recommend this towel cabi.</li>
    <li> This seems to only work for a year.  I purchased this 2nd one July 31, 2014 because the first one quit heating.  This one quit heating again. Will look at others and hopefully find one that will last longer than a year</li>
    <li> Keeps towels evenly hot, easy to handle, perfect for the client!&lt;br /&gt;works well for myself and the other therapist in my spa!</li>
    <li> The only way this towel cabby is going to hold 40 towels is if you use baby washcloths! Very misleading! And it looks very sloppy in appearance. Not that pleased.</li>
    <li> Compact, heats well &amp; sterilizer is a plus, also light weight. Good if you have limited space. Holds about 10 cotton facial towels approx 16 x 27 in size. So far so good, very satisfied. Really like this little Cabi &amp; couldn&#x27;t beat the price. There was no shipping charges at the time ordered &amp; received before estimated date, a real plus. If you are performing back to back facials would recommend something larger. Good Job!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long. So it&#x27;s working like it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> I use this professionally as an esthetician. Great heat and sterilizer. I would recommend for other skincare professionals. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased quite a few of these over the past 3 years or so.  I usually get about 6-9 months worth out of them before having to replace them.  Good price.  Quick shipping.  Under-par product.</li>
    <li> This warmer/steralizer is new to my esthetician room, but so far it has proven to be quite the asset. The towels stay nice and toasty. In fact I can turn the unit off and they remain toasty warm for some time. The unit has a rubber gasket that keeps it sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried to fill it to capacity however it holds a substancial amount of towels, whether rolled or flat. There is a removable wire rack in side the unit which keeps the towels from sitting directly on the metal bottom.  As well as a plastic drip tray which attaches to the bottom of the unit on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is a pro or con, but the metal and plastic is thin, making the unit light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how it holds up, but right now I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This towel warmer has worked great for my facials at work. Really good size, can fit 10 regular size hand towels wrapped up.  Have to say BE CAREFUL when taking them out with your hands, they are soo hot! I am now using tongs to pull out.</li>
    <li> These are faulty, I ordered two and the other one gave off a toxic fume, one did not. Reordered a replacement but then the second one came and smells horrible too! Not going to reorder again!!!!</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly.  It is smaller than I expected and there is no way it would hold the 42 towels it claims.  Still has a funny off gassing smell although it has been used several times.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get all that hot.  The manual was a one page simple overview and written in very poor English.  Not detailed or helpful.</li>
    <li> I have a part-time esthetics practice (I do anywhere from 2-8 facials in a typical  week) and I rent one room in a salon. My previous towel cabby could only hold 6 hand towels and that was if I really crammed them in. This one easily holds 12 so I can set up for several facials at a time, which I love! It heats up very quickly, so it&#x27;s helpful if I have a walk-in wanting an express facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the strong smell - I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s just starting to go away. I hated having that smell in my hot towels so strongly the first week - I cleaned it multiple times but it really just had to burn off I guess.</li>
    <li> I just received this towel warmer, and am totally satisfied with the quality.  It warms up quickly and keeps the towels at a comfortable temperature for clients. The size is nice, just big enough for a few towels, and it does not take up  much room. This is a good price for a quality towel warmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this six months ago and already it is not working.  It seemed to work well throughout the duration up until this week.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it out every night and have maintained it as required.  It&#x27;s ridiculous that it isn&#x27;t working now.  Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Helps me dry the towels. It’s a hassle when I cant have the towels dry fast enough. I hate leaving them wet after washing because it develops a certain smell that doesn’t seem fresh. This product is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> sent quickly&lt;br /&gt;wish the morons in salon used it properly&lt;br /&gt;works well</li>
    <li> Very bad ! It broke within couple of month and it smell horrible ! I exchange a new one and the new one broke again within a month . Never again ! What a waist of the money !</li>
    <li> Top vendors and great product.  Had a small issue with my product that was immediately resolved by the vendor.  They listened and understood and acted quickly to resolve my issue.  If you have an issue....call them and they will take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love our towel warmer and it completes our in-home spa experience.  Our masseuse enjoys the convenience of it when she visits.  No need for dipping towels in hot water or using a microwave AND you can warm up DRY towels - nothing like a warm dry towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towels are always the same temperature coming straight out of the warmer.  No guess-work or scalding.  It&#x27;s like being at the spa for have the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> it came not working now im having trouble sending it back</li>
    <li> Warms up quickly. Light weight. Only annoyance is the metal trey on the inside was bent or something and it wont sit straight. Otherwise, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Heats towels very hot but has horrible smell coming from it! Wiped and scrubbed it down but no luck yet for the smell to disappear!</li>
    <li> Makes my towels very hot and heats quickly. Loving it!!</li>
    <li> The quality is not very good.  You get what you pay for. It gets very hot and burn towels if you don&#x27;t turn it off right the way</li>
    <li> This product heats fine, but the smell is so bad I had to remove it from  my treatment room.  I put it in the garage for several days and the smell still did not go away.  Save your money and invest in a better quality unit.</li>
    <li> product worked great! love this item and comes in handy at my spa. it gets hot as expected and stays at one temp when gets to it. works great and will buy more.</li>
    <li> This was the worse purchase I have ever made on Amazon. I am so disappointed. Got it and as soon as I opened the box I knew it was crap. The rubber seal in the front was falling off and the quality was poor. After I tried it once the next morning when I looked inside the back it was rusted, really! I Sent it back immediately, so disappointed.</li>
    <li> God, I can&#x27;t even open the door of it from the smell. I somehow missed other reviews about this before I ordered, but figured I&#x27;d just wait for it and see. No, that smell is too much. This is getting returned. I bought this to use for a massage practice, but I don&#x27;t even want it in the same room as a client. When I take it out of the plastic bag you can smell it from across the room.</li>
    <li> works very well.  keeps towels very warm.  happy with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping!  Great product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Received right away.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for a new business, and have regretted the purchase every day since.  It heats up nicely, but the chemical smell is unbearable.  From everything that I&#x27;ve read, the manufacturer does not back the product.  It is obvious that the rubber that they used inside is not compatible with the heat that the product generates.  Another example of fine Chinese construction.  This product is a dud, and I&#x27;ll not make another purchase from this manufacturer or reseller.</li>
    <li> I am a massaged therapist and had been looking to get a hot towel cabinet for my office.  I did not want to spend just a whole lot of money and even considered getting a crock pot.  I found this one online at a reasonable price, came in quickly and works perfectly for what I need. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My towel warmer and was decent value. It came in a timely manner, and works very well. I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I love adding hot towels to my massage therapy sessions and this towel warmer did not disappoint! Heats up quickly, too, so there isn&#x27;t long to wait.</li>
    <li> Did not get my towels very hot always smelled funny and stop working in less than a year and I only used it maybe 3 times a week. Burned out way to fast so not really a good deal</li>
    <li> I use the towel warmer for the Jacuzzi which is on the back porch, which is not heated.&lt;br /&gt;Getting out of it and having the hot towel to wrap around you is heaven.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it only fits a smaller towel it works very well.  I turn it on when I get in&lt;br /&gt;the tub and it&#x27;s ready 15 minutes later when I get out. And it&#x27;s sterilized.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Just a little smaller inside than I expected. Other than that it works as expected and nothing was broken. I&#x27;d buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I use this warmer during massages and it is a nice unit that keeps towels at a perfect temperature for my clients. During the first two weeks it did produce a chemical odor that may have just been the coils burning off a coating, but the smell went away with use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a towel warmer for a long long time and finally found a great one for a great price, plus free shipping!! I love that it has both--heat and UV. The size is perfect for my personal use at home. It would be too small in a workplace setting or if you do several massages back to back. I only wish towel warmers in general would come in other colors than white or grey!</li>
    <li> Except for a small fuse this is a good buy, and Salon Sundry was most helpful in explaining what was needed.</li>
    <li> Stopped heating after 3 months of use</li>
    <li> top quality. very satisfied. I use this daily in my massage business for hot towels and hot stones.  gets very hot. the size is perfect, not too big not too little.</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first couple months. Then all of a sudden, it stops working. The UV light is on, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot. It doesn&#x27;t even get warm. Now I&#x27;m having to get hot towels the ghetto fashion was which is using a microwave. Not good or professional. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for our Spa business</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist, I&#x27;ve been heating my hot towels in a crock pot for years. I finally bit the bullet and bought a hot towel cabinet and it&#x27;s made my life, and my practice, so much easier! This cabinet fits perfectly on a nice folding TV stand and doesn&#x27;t get hot and heat up the entire treatment room! The drip tray is a nice touch since the heat occasionally creates condensation. The towels never over heat and I no longer and scalding my hands reaching into a crock pot. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worked good for 5 months then quit.</li>
    <li> I chose this warmer after reading mixed reviews. The size is great for small business, but it heats too strong, no insulation, so the treatment room gets warm too. The worse - due to the strong heat, the rubber around the door smells of burned rubber, and after less then a month, started peeling. In the future I would invest in a more expensive, yet better one</li>
    <li> I bought this for my yoga studio. The door always leaked and made a mess when we opened it. This caused the font casing to rust quickly and now there is some kind of short that trips the reset switch on the plug as soon as we plug it in. It worked for about two months with daily use, but now seems to not be a good long-term solution.</li>
    <li> heats up towels very quickly which is nice, however its taking a while to get out the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> Does not warm up nearly as much as other towel cabinets I have used. :-(</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for with this one. Broken door within 3 mos. No wy to get a hold of manufacturer. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> exellent product good price</li>
    <li> It works great!  I wish the inside was larger.  I use it nearly every day at work and am very pleased.  I may get another one to be able to use more hot towels</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money! looks nice and professional! towels get nice and hot! the uv light could of been a little brighter, but again good buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Other people I know use this same product so I thought I would give it a try.  I really like it but after 5 months I had a problem with the UV feature.  Seriously - I am blown away with the quality of the customer service I received.  Companies just don&#x27;t take care of their customers like this anymore.  I would buy from this vendor in a heartbeat even if they didn&#x27;t have the lowest price (which in this case they did).  I am very pleased to have made this purchase from this company.</li>
    <li> When we received the item, it looked like it would work perfectly. However, 4.5 months later, it broke and no longer heats up like it is supposed to. The last one we bought from somewhere else lasted 8 years. Not sure if it was 1 defective item, or the brand as a whole.</li>
