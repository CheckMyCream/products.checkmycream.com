### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>with the Auto-Stop - what a great invention !  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Just For Men works great.  </li>
      <li>If I touch it up about every 2 months it keeps my hair looking great.</li>
      <li>Looked great</li>
      <li>Husband is happy that he can rely on this product.</li>
      <li>Great even color</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, works great....</li>
      <li>Also the gloves in the package are very cheap.</li>
      <li>Much better than the woman&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>My husband finds this a plus, since it does mask the difference between the roots and the top hair.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I got my Just For Men Autostop free from Smiley360!</li>
      <li>As a long term and happy user of the original just for men this looked great.</li>
      <li>While the one bottle with applicator makes this product easy to use for the most part, the end result was inconsistent color and an incomplete coverage of greys.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I like the original better.</li>
      <li>My advice for men who want full coverage is to use a product made for women!</li>
      <li>I like the idea of the comb in applicator and the fact that it stops automatically when it is finished which would be easy for men.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, just mix the color vial with the catalyst, use the plastic gloves provided, and rub it in as you would shampoo.</li>
      <li>WHY WHEN A COMPANY HAS A FINE PRODUCT THEY WOULD STOP MAKING IT OR CHANGE IT.</li>
      <li>Happy with this product, overall...</li>
      <li>I received a sample of Just For Men Auto Stop from Smiley360 to test out for free.</li>
      <li>and it really is the perfect product for covering grey and leaving the rest of your hair alone.</li>
      <li>Super embarrassing for over a month.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>; remains, which makes the hair look much more natural.  </li>
      <li>Then, rinse it out in the shower and you look great and younger with no signs that it is anything but natural.</li>
      <li>Ok .. You&#x27;re old now</li>
      <li>I would recommend using your own pair of gloves from your local beauty store, and tossing the applicator.</li>
      <li>, so far I am really pleased.</li>
      <li>I had used their older formula of the same color for about 4 years and had been very pleased.  </li>
      <li>This Auto Stop is a far inferior product to the old shampoo in kind they used to make.</li>
      <li>The results were consistent.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed Sandy Blonde of the two-bottle formulation for years.</li>
      <li>I will be attempting to buy the old product if it is still available.</li>
      <li>Just accept it and be glad your n@ds aren&#x27;t hitting the toilet water yet.</li>
      <li>For those men who do not want the look of grey roots and colored top hair, this works well as it gently begins to lose some of the color over time.  </li>
      <li>One star is even too much.</li>
      <li>Believe me, with the original, if you get distracted, you&#x27;ll end up looking like Elvis - fat or original, he had jet black hair</li>
      <li>This product applies very easily, and takes little time to color.  </li>
      <li>Tried to find the older formula but could not find it anywhere.  </li>
      <li>Works as promised, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>very useful for old grey men</li>
      <li>Trying to find a new dye to use, and replace this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The new formula goes on as a medium brown, not sandy blond.</li>
      <li>to top it off, they made it more expensive!</li>
      <li>you only have grey on certain parts of your head, just do those - saves money and looks more natural ( as long as you&#x27;ve picked the correct color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new change in formula has completely changed the color and results.  </li>
      <li>Other then that the smell was not horrible as in some dyes I have used and did give complete coverage of grey hair</li>
      <li>Starting getting a little more gray than I&#x27;d like to see.  </li>
      <li>That never happened with the old formula.</li>
      <li>Just For Men returns it to it&#x27;s natural color and no one has ever mentioned noticing a change in my hair.</li>
      <li>AND IF YOU DO IT&#x27;S 2 TO 3 TIMES THE OLD PRICE.</li>
      <li>That way you can wind out the coloring completely, and when you put the cap on for storage, all the air will be removed because you&#x27;re rolling up the tube.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not like the old color.</li>
      <li>Now looking for another manufacturer or will have it done by a professional.  </li>
      <li>As we age, our natural hair color begins to change and the gray sneaks in.</li>
      <li>I have naturally sandy blond hair, so it worked well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give you the dyed look, natural look.</li>
      <li>never happened with the old color kit.  </li>
      <li>You leave it on the full 10-15 minutes, and your hair will come out DARK, and stay that way for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Like many of the other reviewers I used the old formula Sandy Blonde for several years.</li>
      <li>The ladies appreciate it and it probably makes life easier in the professional world too since employers lean towards youthfulness in their general selectivity processes.</li>
      <li>For a light haired man, stick with SANDY BLONDE, which is a little darker than I would have predicted...but again, the end product does create a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Since the new formulation, I have seen allergic reactions during the site test performed prior to the coloring, which means consumer cannot use the product!</li>
      <li>Color 9A works similar to the old Sandy Blond.</li>
      <li>I have found Clairol Natural Instincts for women (it&#x27;s the same as the men&#x27;s, just different packaging).</li>
      <li>Color is not the same as previous shampoo in color and last much shorter period of time.</li>

<li> The only people who could use this and have any satisfaction would be someone without grey.</li>
<li> I have grey hair, whitish grey.</li>
<li> This will be an interesting case study in how a company destroys its customer base by beta testing their new product on them.</li>
<li> the color looked fake, doesn&#x27;t someone make a hair color for men that looks real and natural?</li>
<li> same result..  very dark brown hair.</li>
<li> I am confused why several raters give this product such a LOW rating.  </li>
<li> Will you get pink or orange?</li>
<li> Use with extreme caution...  </li>
<li> Hard to find this color at local drug stores.  </li>
<li> this product turned my sandy blond hair dark dark brown when used as directed.  </li>
<li> Just makes my gray in my dark brown hair look frosted.  </li>
<li> It went on well and wasn&#x27;t dark from the start.</li>
<li> Resulting color is unpredictable.  </li>
<li> (did you know he dyed it from brown to black because his mother had black hair?)</li>
<li> What a mess.</li>
<li> Ever since they went to this Auto Stop, the color went on very dark, then turned reddish as it faded.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t understand how any manufacturer can destroy a product and brand.</li>
<li> Waste of time and money</li>
<li> small amount of the gray&amp;#34</li>
<li> couldn&#x27;t go to church yesterday, and wonder what people have been saying for the past week or two?</li>
<li> Unfortunately I was supposed to receive Sandy Blonde and got brown</li>
<li> /&gt;Buy at least 1-2 shades LIGHTER.</li>
<li> I was a bit concerned that the coloring would look fake or that my hair would be to dark.  </li>
<li> NOT A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION.</li>
<li> /&gt;Buy at least 1-2 shades lighter !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
<li> They went to this Auto Stop formula about 6 months ago, and I have been disappointed ever since.  </li>
<li> VERY VERY bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great product.  Easy to use and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed Sandy Blonde of the two-bottle formulation for years. I have grey hair, whitish grey. It went on well and wasn&#x27;t dark from the start. Over a month it gradually lightened. Looked great and I wasn&#x27;t a whitehead any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they went on the &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; bent, and have destroyed a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sandy Blonde A-10 or whatever number goes on as a medium brown. Not Sandy Blonde. My hair is a disaster and it feels like straw. Then to my amazement I looked closely after I could finally look at myself in the mirror again, and the under-hair is just white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t go to church yesterday, and wonder what people have been saying for the past week or two? OMG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how any manufacturer can destroy a product and brand. The only people who could use this and have any satisfaction would be someone without grey. VERY VERY bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to top it off, they made it more expensive!</li>
    <li> I USED H-10 SANDY BLOND FOR YRS AND YRS. COULD ALWAY&#x27;S DEPEND ON IT. NOW YOU CAN&#x27;T FIND IT AND IF YOU DO IT&#x27;S 2 TO 3 TIMES THE OLD PRICE. TRIED TO CALL COMBE THE PARENT CO AND NO ONE EVEN KNEW WHO TO PUT ME THRU TO. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY WHEN A COMPANY HAS A FINE PRODUCT THEY WOULD STOP MAKING IT OR CHANGE IT. NOT A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION. WISH I COULD TELL COMBE THIS BECAUSE THEY DON&#x27;T SEEM TO KNOW.</li>
    <li> This product applies very easily, and takes little time to color.  For those men who do not want the look of grey roots and colored top hair, this works well as it gently begins to lose some of the color over time.  My husband finds this a plus, since it does mask the difference between the roots and the top hair.</li>
    <li> Color is not the same as previous shampoo in color and last much shorter period of time. Time to find a different product!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the comb in applicator and the fact that it stops automatically when it is finished which would be easy for men. Unfortunately I was supposed to receive Sandy Blonde and got brown instead so my husband wouldn&#x27;t try it. #samp</li>
    <li> I got my Just For Men Autostop free from Smiley360! While the one bottle with applicator makes this product easy to use for the most part, the end result was inconsistent color and an incomplete coverage of greys. Since the new formulation, I have seen allergic reactions during the site test performed prior to the coloring, which means consumer cannot use the product! My advice for men who want full coverage is to use a product made for women!</li>
    <li> Use with extreme caution...  this product turned my sandy blond hair dark dark brown when used as directed.  I thought it just might have been on  too long, so I tried it again several months later and applied it for only 2 minutes then rinsed it out..  same result..  very dark brown hair. What a mess.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this color at local drug stores.  Husband is happy that he can rely on this product.</li>
    <li> Resulting color is unpredictable.  Will you get pink or orange?</li>
    <li> As we age, our natural hair color begins to change and the gray sneaks in. Just For Men returns it to it&#x27;s natural color and no one has ever mentioned noticing a change in my hair. It is easy to use, just mix the color vial with the catalyst, use the plastic gloves provided, and rub it in as you would shampoo. Then, rinse it out in the shower and you look great and younger with no signs that it is anything but natural.</li>
    <li> Starting getting a little more gray than I&#x27;d like to see.  I decided to try Just For Men.  I was a bit concerned that the coloring would look fake or that my hair would be to dark.  Just For Men works great.  If I touch it up about every 2 months it keeps my hair looking great.</li>
    <li> I am a female and buy this stuff over and over. Much better than the woman&#x27;s products. Just makes my gray in my dark brown hair look frosted.  I have been using it for years and it really is the perfect product for covering grey and leaving the rest of your hair alone. I am 67 and yes there is grey but people are always comment on how I don&#x27;t have any grey because it looks so natural.</li>
    <li> Works as promised, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I like the original better.</li>
    <li> Great even color, so far I am really pleased. Doesn&#x27;t give you the dyed look, natural look.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I left it on for about 15 minutes which is longer than directed and still saw no change in hair color.</li>
    <li> very useful for old grey men</li>
    <li> I would not even give it one star as the product does not work. As a long term and happy user of the original just for men this looked great. However it does not work on gray hair. I will be attempting to buy the old product if it is still available. This will be an interesting case study in how a company destroys its customer base by beta testing their new product on them.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Just For Men Auto Stop from Smiley360 to test out for free. The dye did completely cover all the grey hair nicely, but the applicator was very difficult to use. Also the gloves in the package are very cheap. I would recommend using your own pair of gloves from your local beauty store, and tossing the applicator. Other then that the smell was not horrible as in some dyes I have used and did give complete coverage of grey hair</li>
    <li> This does not cover all the gray?</li>
    <li> The new change in formula has completely changed the color and results.  Used Sandy Blond of the two-bottle formulation for years. I have naturally sandy blond hair, so it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula goes on as a medium brown, not sandy blond. After the color is shampooed out, some of the hair is colored sandy blond, some parts are brown and some are an off white shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This never happened with the old color kit.  Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great....I love it</li>
    <li> Works great.  A basic survival tool.  The ladies appreciate it and it probably makes life easier in the professional world too since employers lean towards youthfulness in their general selectivity processes.</li>
    <li> I am confused why several raters give this product such a LOW rating.  What I do like is that &amp;#34;a small amount of the gray&amp;#34; remains, which makes the hair look much more natural.  For a light haired man, stick with SANDY BLONDE, which is a little darker than I would have predicted...but again, the end product does create a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;.  Happy with this product, overall...</li>
    <li> I do not leave home without using it.</li>
    <li> They went to this Auto Stop formula about 6 months ago, and I have been disappointed ever since.  I had used their older formula of the same color for about 4 years and had been very pleased.  The results were consistent.  Ever since they went to this Auto Stop, the color went on very dark, then turned reddish as it faded.  That never happened with the old formula. Tried to find the older formula but could not find it anywhere.  Now looking for another manufacturer or will have it done by a professional.  Just for Men have lost me as a customer.</li>
    <li> Not like the old color. Fades away in four weeks</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at least 1-2 shades LIGHTER. You leave it on the full 10-15 minutes, and your hair will come out DARK, and stay that way for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t want stained skin or ears?  Take something like a Chap-Stick, and outline your scalp and ears.  It doesn&#x27;t allow the coloring to get to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a $1 plastic toothpaste &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34;. That way you can wind out the coloring completely, and when you put the cap on for storage, all the air will be removed because you&#x27;re rolling up the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only have grey on certain parts of your head, just do those - saves money and looks more natural ( as long as you&#x27;ve picked the correct color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at least 1-2 shades lighter !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay with the Auto-Stop - what a great invention !  Believe me, with the original, if you get distracted, you&#x27;ll end up looking like Elvis - fat or original, he had jet black hair (did you know he dyed it from brown to black because his mother had black hair?)</li>
    <li> the color looked fake, doesn&#x27;t someone make a hair color for men that looks real and natural?</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers I used the old formula Sandy Blonde for several years. Then I use this and my hair is yellow. Super embarrassing for over a month. One star is even too much. I will not buy this rubbish again. I have found Clairol Natural Instincts for women (it&#x27;s the same as the men&#x27;s, just different packaging). Color 9A works similar to the old Sandy Blond.</li>
    <li> This Auto Stop is a far inferior product to the old shampoo in kind they used to make. Trying to find a new dye to use, and replace this one.</li>
    <li> Ok .. You&#x27;re old now and you need to color your grays.. Just accept it and be glad your n@ds aren&#x27;t hitting the toilet water yet.</li>
