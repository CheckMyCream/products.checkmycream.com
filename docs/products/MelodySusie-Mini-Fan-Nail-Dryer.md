      <li>affordable - it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>so my grownup hand could completely fit (fingers and thumb) under the fan....</li>
      <li>takes batteries and just makes a whirring sound.  </li>
      <li>this product is user friendly and my daughters like it a lot.</li>
      <li>, arrived quickly</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 9 yr old daughter and so far it works great</li>
      <li>This is a cheap good little hand dryer.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product right after Christmas and just took it out of the box</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically just a little fan, but its nice to have and its really easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably ok if you were a little more patient.</li>
      <li>It beats blowing on my own nails hoping for them to dry</li>
      <li>It fits my toddler&#x27;s hand perfectly and its a fun little accessory to quickly dry nails.</li>
      <li>(I recommend Revlon quick dry top coat</li>
      <li>She absolutely LOVES it!</li>
      <li>It is pretty much what I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not loud and it dries her nails so much faster than they would in just the open air, which is great since our family is quite the busy bunch.</li>
      <li>a bit noisy, but nothing obnoxious - kind of sounds like those little fans people wear around their necks when they are waiting in line at amusement parks.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my wife and it does the job very well.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very cute and gurly and small enough to fit in my bag</li>
      <li>It is drying my nails; although not as fast as I would like</li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and holds up well to being used by a child.  </li>
      <li>does what it should - blows airs similar to how you would blow on your own nails (not an industrial fan by any means); also is not a magic dryer that instantly sets your nails, you have to pick the right nail polish top coat for that</li>
      <li>Pretty simple design but worth the money.</li>
      <li>received a defective unit that would only work when I hit a \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>compact - a couple inches wide and can easily pack it in a carry on if you&#x27;re going on vacation</li>
      <li>Overall, I really like it and its worth the price.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The fan is a good idea for people like me who like to do their nails casually at home and don&#x27;t have more than 15 minutes to sit around, waiting for them to dry.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t demand a new product or anything drastic like that.</li>
      <li>If fixing something you buy new doesn&#x27;t bother you than go ahead and buy this.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t demand a new product or anything drastic like that.in my opinion), so</li>
      <li>quick dry nail drops)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>definitely recommend for girls who love pink,  could not find in any stores,  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very loud and distracting while we&#x27;re watching TV.  </li>
      <li>It got here fast enough for her  Christmas to.</li>
      <li>We bought this for our 3 year old since she loves doing her nails with mommy.</li>
      <li>but I was surprised that it doesn&#x27;t have an off and on switch.</li>
      <li>I bought the nail dryer for my 7 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  </li>
      <li>A quick email from the seller stating they were substituting a different tool and asking if I still wanted the dryer would have gone a long way toward the goodwill of the customer.  </li>
      <li>, you have to not fidget when your nails are in the unit drying, but this is a good item to make you dry your nails for a few minutes, preventing you from trying to change the channel with the TV remote without ruining your manicure.  </li>
      <li>She says it isn&#x27;t very powerful but definitely cuts down on drying time.</li>
      <li>barely any wind action.  </li>
      <li>I tried to get a new one but the seller never got back to me.</li>
      <li>I leave my nails underneath it for around 10-15 seconds and they are much dryer than if I had just let them air dry.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it will last very long as I could hear the unevenness of the motor the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>sensitivity - you have to push the bottom button around the middle area for it to work and you have to apply some pressure (i.e., a soft touch or just putting pressure on the sides might not work).  </li>
      <li>You can only dry one hand at a time, but not a bad little contraption.</li>

<li> Just put your hand or foot in and press down.</li>
<li> My wife does her nails on the couch but is very impatient when it comes to letting them dry.  </li>

    <li> Love it. two years later, i am still using it. thank you.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> It is drying my nails; although not as fast as I would like but it works.  I just hold it for about five minutes;</li>
    <li> The nail dryer arrived at my house sooner than I thought. I just love it. Use it everyday. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Okay for the price. It&#x27;s a bit noisy but, does work okay.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap good little hand dryer. I bought it for my wife and it does the job very well.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our 3 year old since she loves doing her nails with mommy. We use it all the time for fingernails and toenails. I wish there was more depth so my grownup hand could completely fit (fingers and thumb) under the fan.... but the title does say &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; to describe the item. It fits my toddler&#x27;s hand perfectly and its a fun little accessory to quickly dry nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a nail dryer for a long time. So I finally went to Amazon and saw this one. It&#x27;s perfect it dries my nails in no time. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have the pink one it&#x27;s very cute and gurly and small enough to fit in my bag but I was surprised that it doesn&#x27;t have an off and on switch. You have to press ur fingers down inside as they dry. That sucks!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt; The dryer is a nice size&lt;br /&gt; There is a place to plug it in, so you don&#x27;t have to use batteries&lt;br /&gt; Good price&lt;br /&gt; The nail/cuticle clipper that comes with it is a great addition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; You have to push on the pad just right to have the fan run properly and you have to push hard&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t come with a cord&lt;br /&gt; It is noisier than I expected&lt;br /&gt; The fan doesn&#x27;t seem very strong</li>
    <li> this product is user friendly and my daughters like it a lot. It&#x27;s ideal for outdoors since it&#x27;s also battery operated.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my pre-teen daughter who was on a nail painting kick and her and her friends loved it. Pretty simple design but worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I bought one for me and then I had to go buy this one for my daughter. She is pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it and it must have been good for her needs and she really liked the color . It got here fast enough for her  Christmas to.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> After a few uses the thing stops working</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I leave my nails underneath it for around 10-15 seconds and they are much dryer than if I had just let them air dry. It&#x27;s basically just a little fan, but its nice to have and its really easy to use. Other people have said you have to push down really hard, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that to be true. Just be careful not to bump your wet nails as you put them into the fan! Overall, I really like it and its worth the price.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an ok dryer.  However, I don&#x27;t think it will last very long as I could hear the unevenness of the motor the first time I used it.  I am disappointed that I did not get the nail nipper.  Instead I got another manicure tool.  A quick email from the seller stating they were substituting a different tool and asking if I still wanted the dryer would have gone a long way toward the goodwill of the customer.  I would have gotten the dryer anyway but now I feel I was deceived by not getting what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I had one of these twenty years ago when I was a teen and it is just like I remember. I now bought this for my teen and it works the same and she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works great and compact. Can bring it anywhere.</li>
    <li> nail clipper comes with this is a great addition. but fan runs slow and doesn&#x27;t have power cord which company should have given. waiting time is longer for nail polish to dry. good to have but takes time.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it until I put batteries in it and it didn&#x27;t work. I tried to get a new one but the seller never got back to me. I took it a port and found one of the wires  came unsoldered. Solder that wire back on and it works perfect now. If fixing something you buy new doesn&#x27;t bother you than go ahead and buy this. Maybe you will get one that isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought 2. The one is great for 1 hand, but I am not patient and would prefer to do both hands at once.</li>
    <li> The fan is a good idea for people like me who like to do their nails casually at home and don&#x27;t have more than 15 minutes to sit around, waiting for them to dry.  Here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. affordable - it&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;2. compact - a couple inches wide and can easily pack it in a carry on if you&#x27;re going on vacation&lt;br /&gt;3. does what it should - blows airs similar to how you would blow on your own nails (not an industrial fan by any means); also is not a magic dryer that instantly sets your nails, you have to pick the right nail polish top coat for that (I recommend Revlon quick dry top coat &gt; OPI quick dry nail drops)&lt;br /&gt;4. forces you to be patient thereby stopping you from ruining your mani - well, you have to not fidget when your nails are in the unit drying, but this is a good item to make you dry your nails for a few minutes, preventing you from trying to change the channel with the TV remote without ruining your manicure.  It beats blowing on my own nails hoping for them to dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. a bit noisy, but nothing obnoxious - kind of sounds like those little fans people wear around their necks when they are waiting in line at amusement parks.  One of my dogs hates it, my other dog doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. sensitivity - you have to push the bottom button around the middle area for it to work and you have to apply some pressure (i.e., a soft touch or just putting pressure on the sides might not work).  I did not find it difficult to push the button, a hand at rest with some conscious effort to press the button would trigger the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a defective unit that would only work when I hit a \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot;.  I returned the product explaining what the issue was and requested a refund.  The company did reach out and explained that my problem likely indicated a defective unit.  Another one should arrive, so hopefully that one will work.  But, responsiveness from a seller is key when buying items on Amazon (in my opinion), so kudos to them for doing that even through I didn&#x27;t demand a new product or anything drastic like that.in my opinion), so kudos to them for doing that even through I didn&#x27;t demand a new product or anything drastic like that.</li>
    <li> definitely recommend for girls who love pink,  could not find in any stores,  great find,  priced very well, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work all the time.  Sometimes when pressed on, the fan comes on.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  And it say it&#x27;s \\&quot;Battery Operated or DC Adaptor\\&quot;, which I interpreted to mean it came with a power cord.  It does not.  Junk.  And I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s past 30 days (I ordered it early for a bday gift, and by the birthday, it was too late.)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 9 yr old daughter and so far it works great &amp; she loves it. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friends daughter who is 11 and she absolutely loved it and the color too.  It even came with a clipper too which was a nice addition.</li>
    <li> My wife does her nails on the couch but is very impatient when it comes to letting them dry.  I thought this would remedy that.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very loud and distracting while we&#x27;re watching TV.  It&#x27;s also a little small so she ends up banging her fingers on the edge, messing up her nail polish because she didn&#x27;t wait long enough.  It&#x27;s probably ok if you were a little more patient.</li>
    <li> Had to send it back because it did not work at all even with two different battery brands that I tried. Junk.</li>
    <li> I bought the nail dryer for my 7 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  She is thrilled.  It is very sturdy and holds up well to being used by a child.  It is easy to use.  Just put your hand or foot in and press down. I am so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is not a nail salon dryer.  It is pretty much what I thought it would be.  The little fan blows just enough to dry your nails a little faster than simple wait drying.  The cord could be a little longer.  You can only dry one hand at a time, but not a bad little contraption.</li>
    <li> takes batteries and just makes a whirring sound.  no light or heat.  barely any wind action.  this works great for a play toy.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my sister for the holidays. She absolutely LOVES it! It&#x27;s not loud and it dries her nails so much faster than they would in just the open air, which is great since our family is quite the busy bunch. It&#x27;s showing no signs of giving out yet, but if it ever does, I&#x27;ll be back here ordering it once again. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> It works great and I&#x27;m shocked at how long the batteries last in it.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She says it isn&#x27;t very powerful but definitely cuts down on drying time. I made her a vanity and this was a nice addition.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product right after Christmas and just took it out of the box and it does not work at all.  This product was horrible and I&#x27;&#x27;ve shopped with Amazon for a long time and cannot even return the defective product</li>
    <li> works good made of plastic</li>
    <li> it is just okay i mean it works but there is no place for your thumb so it doesnt dry it</li>
</ol>
