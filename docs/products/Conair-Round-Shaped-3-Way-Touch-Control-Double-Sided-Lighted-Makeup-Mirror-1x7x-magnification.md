<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really researched on Amazon to decide on which mirror to buy. I knew I wanted one with a darker finish and I didn&#x27;t want anything more than $50. Conair is a reputable name and I&#x27;ve bought many of their products in the past. The thing that convinced me to buy this particular mirror was the review that had pictures posted of what it looks like in person. I am not disappointed. Well worth the money and I highly recommend it.  Beautifully made, provides three great light settings and it is not a yellowish light like displayed in the photo. Love it.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror...a little tall for me...but I do like it!</li>
    <li> It took me forever to find this as my other one I have had for years finally broke. The BEST thing about it that it has a 10X magnifer instead of 5X on my old one..great quality</li>
    <li> I was worried that the light wouldn&#x27;t be bright enough but I was pleasantly surprised. I love the touch control and the color of the light makes it look expensive. I am very please with this light and would very highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very clear mirror and touch base is great</li>
    <li> Heavy base but that is good so it will not tip.  It is a matt black.  The light has three levels and the mirrors are good quality.  Great price for the quality.  I am getting use to not touching the base to move as this activates the light.</li>
    <li> This mirror is almost what I was looking for. The size is good, the magnification is great, it&#x27;s sturdy and solid. However the light, even on high isn&#x27;t bright enough for me. I also like that it&#x27;s touch activated but I need to turn it back on at least twice when I touch it by accident and it shuts off! All in all I&#x27;m happy with it and would have given it 5 stars if it were brighter.</li>
    <li> I converted an antique sewing machine into a dressing table and this goes perfectly with it. I was looking for a mirror with an antique finish. I do bump it sometimes and turn it off accidentally, but I like the &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; feature to turn it on. I had purchased other ones, only to bring it home and not somethng-or-other about it: too fluorescent or the switch was inconvenient. This one is perfect for my needs, but I do wish the light was a bit brighter on its brightest setting.</li>
    <li> The black matte color is great and goes with my decor. The lighting and magnification are great, too. I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because the touch feature is so sensitive. I read about it before my purchase so I expected it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a lighting option on it (day, candle, night, etc).</li>
    <li> The mirror is big enough and the magnification is great enough to see your face pretty well, but the light&#x27;s not bright enough to see the stray hairs on your chin. I kept it because my face looks better when I look into this mirror! I&#x27;m going to buy a little lamp to put next to it for when I need to face reality (no pun intended)</li>
    <li> Helps me to see when putting on eye make-up, especially.  Good magnification without distortion.  Like the touch base with 3 levels of light.</li>
    <li> I am so happy and pleased with this mirror!! It is perfect in every way!</li>
    <li> Light is not very bright. Returned product</li>
    <li> I am completely happy with this product totally recommend it. Its a great size mirror.</li>
    <li> good lighting and size.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  Love the size and the touch control base.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a more expensive one. The old ones fluorescent bulb burned out and was expensive to replace then only a few months later burned out again. It also didn&#x27;t reverse to a regular mirror. My wife wishes she could give it more than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it, I am thinking I need one.  It is solid and well made.</li>
    <li> Love it.  The highest light setting is bright enough for me to apply makeup without using a lamp in the background.  The only downside is the touch control base.  You only need to touch it lightly and the light goes off.  Other than that it is a great makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy one of these sooner? Three levels of light. Easy to use. I sometimes leave it on low for ambiance. No switch to mess with, just touch it.</li>
    <li> She had an older version - broke it on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is not an exact replacement, she does love it!</li>
    <li> love the adjustability of light and viewing</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, but the magnification just isn&#x27;t quite strong enough for me. my last mirror had a magnification of 10. I should have known better then go down and number</li>
    <li> love love love love love!!! as described, fast shipping, beautiful flat black satin finish gorgeous lighting and tough base, swivels 7x and 1 x magnification</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. Needs a higher light setting</li>
    <li> Does what it should - normal magnification is good, magnified side seems too curved so you need to stand VERY close to it. Pretty disappointed with now dim the highest setting is. Hard to do your daytime makeup with a mirror that simulates evening lighting. Area strong mirror gets far hotter than I&#x27;d expected. I am actually nervous about leaving it on for too long. May need to look for an LED mirror instead.</li>
    <li> This mirror is an absolute dream, more then I expected. I love the magnified side! When you don&#x27;t need magnification just flip and you have a regular mirror. Love the touch light feature. Would definitely buy again and even recommend to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. My last mirror I&#x27;d had for 10 years, finally after cracking on both sides, and all the light bulbs burning out I decided to replace. It had a &amp;#34;daylight&amp;#34; setting which I really wanted, but the three light settings on this are fine. I use the brightest setting and use it in a well lit room. I use it everyday. I would definitely re-buy. I thought the touch control would be annoying but its really not. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, I was a little disappointed that it was so thick, but that&#x27;s what happens when it has a light inside. It works perfectly and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great quality mirror.  Light has 3 different brightness levels.</li>
    <li> Love the size it is tall not short and the touch system works great. It is a little dim even at its brightest but overall great buy worth the price and money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize had touch base with three setting and love this. Lighting and magnification perfect and this color is very complementary  to my marble vanity.</li>
    <li> this was definitely a great purchase. I love the look and the weight of it. The only drawback is the mirror is a little smaller than I thought, but I do enjoy the magnification. Love the touch feature. If your contiplating an online make up mirror...don&#x27;t doubt this choice.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I wanted. It is a touch lamp and  have a cord with a 8x magnifying  glass so can see clearly  what&#x27;s  going on with the face. Thanks.</li>
    <li> All you have to do is bump the mirror and it turns off several times upon use.  I give it one star.</li>
    <li> Wish I got this sooner. Easy to use/flip two sides. Light could be brighter but I&#x27;m still quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and it still works great.  Perfect light that isn&#x27;t too harsh or bright.  Love the touch feature.</li>
    <li> Works great, the lighting is perfect (according to my girlfriend). Very sensitive to touch just needs a little tap to brighten/dim the light. If you are looking for that daylight white LED look, this model projects more of a yellowish warm hue. That is the only other comment I feel would help distinguish what brand or model to get.</li>
    <li> The perfect makeup mirror!</li>
    <li> Nice looking product, does everything it says it will do.  I thought I&#x27;d like the 8&amp;#34; width, but it seemed giant on my vanity, almost like a huge spotlight.  I returned it and purchased a 7&amp;#34; wide oval shaped mirror.  The bit smaller scale seems a better fit.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great! I wanted something that was a little more stylish and could sit out on my dresser. I really like the touch feature to turn on the light. It has three levels of brightness. The only thing I wish was a little different would be that the brightest setting of light is still fairly dim. I have gotten used to it. However in the morning, due to it being placed next to a window, the sunshine will overpower the light coming from the mirror. I have used a desk lamp on the other side to even out the light on my face when the sun is out. Overall, I would buy again. The size is great and it looks stylish sitting out. I have had this mirror for about 3 months now.</li>
    <li> works great! my daughter whom i purchased this for her 18th bday, absolutely loves it and uses it daily.  The light and magnification works out great too! great quality and color matches her room.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this mirror. The magnifying side is great for applying eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Daughter LOVES this light to do her makeup!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really been enjoying this mirror. It is not a real white light, like someone else stated, but I think it&#x27;s perfect for makeup. The magnifying side is pure bonus for me since my last mirror didn&#x27;t have magnification.</li>
    <li> Like this mirror. It&#x27;s larger than I thought. It is touch controlled so I tend to turn off quite a bit, which is kind of a nuisance. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Love this item. Two things to make a note of when purchasing: Light isn&#x27;t a white light. It is more of a setting for &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; makeup. Yellowish, if you will. And also the magnification side isn&#x27;t super close, if that makes sense. I think its a great mirror. I do wish the magnification was better, but its OK. The mirror is sturdy. The base is the only portion that you can touch to turn on and change brightness. My cat has rubbed against it quite a few times and it has not turned off on me. For those that say it is easy to change and turn off and can be frustrating... Just don&#x27;t touch the base. Simple as that. From the side it is thick. I&#x27;d say 3 or 4 inches. Maybe in the middle. It is a wonderful mirror and does its job. Shipping was quick as well!</li>
    <li> Perfect product/ Stellar seller</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and doesn&#x27;t appear to have any issues.  My wife has been using it happily without complaint.  She did mention that she like the touch feature to turn the lights on and it has different brightnesses.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> The touch/tap light is quite annoying. I hit it a good 5 times on accident when I am getting ready, I would rather have an on/off switch.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER!!! I really like this mirror :)</li>
    <li> I would like the light to be brighter, but overall I am pleased with the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a fabuloua mirror.</li>
    <li> Good size for a mirror, not too big not too small. Light has multiple settings unlike some mirrors but it is a yellow light rather than white LED so its kinda on the dull side. If you have another light on in the room it is adequate for makeup application. The fact that it has lights on both sides is pretty awesome though.</li>
    <li> This is a great lighted mirror. it is a nice size for applying makeup and the 7x magnification works very well. The touch base lighting is also very nice, overall a great makeup mirror!</li>
    <li> It matches my oil rubbed bronze fixtures and works great. There is way more light and magnificaion that with my previous mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror!!  Except the base when touched turns it on, and it is so sensitive that when I just barely touch it - the mirror goes on and off a lot. lol</li>
    <li> Love this mirror especially with the &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; capability. The only down side is I wish the lighting was brighter.</li>
    <li> Lighting good be brighter. Draw back everytime you touch the stand to move the mirror it turns light off. Kinda aggrivating feature when your trying to get ready for work. Mirror size is nice and magnification on the other side is good</li>
    <li> i am in love. the touch is amazing and so helpful. matches my makeup desk and the light settings are great.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I love that the mirror is touch control, it is also a very good size mirror and the height is amazing!!! The 3 light setting are amazing as well.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mirror!! I&#x27;ve had many different lighted mirrors &amp; this is by far the best. I had one for 8 years &amp; the light bulb never even burned out. The only reason I had to replace it was due to a storm that caused a power surge &amp; fried all our appliances. I would be heart broken if they discontinued this mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is beautiful and high quality. I&#x27;m super picky and was pleased with how this looks and functions. This mirror is worth double the asking price! So pleased with conair once again!  :)</li>
    <li> Came in great working and physical condition for used product and arrived on time.  All working parts. Someone went really crazy with the packing tape, much appreciate for the thoroughness but lawwwd it was a struggle to open the box, haha ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously though, the mirror itself I wish the light was less yellow and more of a white or clear bulb but hopefully when the bulb dies I can change that for more natural looking lighting.  Other than that I am very pleased with the product and the tap-touch feature on the base to turn on the light is super convenient for applying makeup and what I was looking for on my new mirror (because it was super on my old one as well).</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I always have to get up early before my boyfriend get up without awake him. This light is perfect for me because it has three different lighting sets. Also it has two sides which is perfect when I need to some deep cleaning for me nose. Highly recommended for this product!</li>
    <li> The color is great and looks very nice on my antique dressing table.  I love that it has touch on/off.  Although, any time I accidently touch the base it turns off.  My eyesight is not horrible, but I do wear bifocals.  I thought 7x would be strong enough to see my eyebrows to pluck them, but it&#x27;s not.  I do wish I had bought a 10x.  The halo light is a little too dim.  I need to turn on the light on my vanity along with the mirror&#x27;s halo light in order to really see well enough to put on my makeup.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this mirror for a year and she liked it well enough except that the light was too dim and a bit on the yellow side.  But on the whole it was acceptable.  Now the light bulb has burned out and I can&#x27;t find an exact replacement.  The mirror box said that the original bulb was 30 watts.  The replacement bulbs I see on the conair website are only 20 watts.  So if I replace with one of them, then the &amp;#34;too dim&amp;#34; mirror will be even more dim.  I contacted conair about this and I received an auto reply type message that doesn&#x27;t help me at all.  I don&#x27;t recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I saw mirrors at walmart for $20 that were lighted and just as good. In my opinion it is over priced.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror 2 months ago and left it in the box. I just unpacked it into a new home about a week ago, and the touch lamp already does not work.</li>
    <li> Not bright enough and my wife&#x27;s exact words were &amp;#34;its fine&amp;#34;. We know what that means.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking and performing mirror.  Purchase with confidence.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Light is hella not bright. Mirror isnt that great. Mine new mirror is literally just sitting there for looks which totally could have gotten a way cheaper one for hella lees</li>
    <li> so glad I splurged. I can finally really see do apply my makeup. Yep, it shows all the flaws. Now I can actually see to cover them up!! Very good buy.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  It&#x27;s crystal clear,  perfectly lit,  sturdy,  great quality,  double sided &amp; each side has the light, which I was not aware of.  This thing makes my other mirror look like a miniature lol.</li>
    <li> still not enough lighting to put on makeup.  needed to buy floor lamp as well.</li>
    <li> Opps! Gave the wrong review on the Oval mirror-sent it back it was way too small. This is the better one.</li>
    <li> I like the way it looks. I like that it has a touch base. It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> The light is not as bright as I expected but overall it is a sturdy product. The only negative, and this is not the fault of the mirror, is that it is very easy to accidentally touch the base when using the mirror close up and so you often turn it on and off accidentally.  Still a very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Stand is nice and light is fine. However, the quality of the actual mirror is very poor.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. Very nice lighting and perfect for make up vanity not to big or balky. A nice addition to my room.</li>
