<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife LOVE&#x27;S this product on her unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. This really does help to cut down on the drying time for hair. I have very thick hair that if drying on its own takes a good four to five hours to dry. This helps cut down on the drying time when you are short on time.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and using this product cuts the drying time and prevents frizzes. I have used other cream type heat protection for my hair and they feel heavy. This is very light and has a great smell!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. And OMG this stuff is amazing. I will never not have it. And it smells so so so so good!!!  But it. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> I feel my hair is protected from blowing it dry and using the curling iron.  It comes out in such a fine mist</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was just what I ordered. This was an item I previously bought at my hairdresser&#x27;s, so I knew what I was buying. This product makes my hair dry faster, hopefully causing less damage.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003UNPS0Q Kenra Platinum Blow-Dry Spray 3.4 oz.]]My Hair dresser uses this on my hair and I love it because you can dry your blow dry your hair within minutes.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot (3 sprays). This is a good sized bottle for a good price!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair dresser.  It smells delicious and I like how my hair looks.  I can&#x27;t necessarily say that this alone does the trick to get my frizzy, curly hair silky straight, but it helps!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at great price!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product on the advice of a beautician. My hair was breaking and was like straw. I purchased this item along with the silkening gloss. My hair is shiny and manageable now. And this definitely speeds up the blowdrying time</li>
    <li> I love this spray. I have fine hair that looks frayed from daily blow-drying/flat ironing.  I use a lot of this spray. I spray it all over, especially the ends. Then after I blow dry I spray the front section all the way down to the ends (the part that takes the brunt of the heat styling) before I flat iron. The result is sleek, glossy looking hair. This is the only leave-in product I use now. Does not make your hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> My hair dries SO fast with this stuff, and smells delicious all day! Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
    <li> this stuff seriously cuts your drying time in half...  has a very nice light smell. dont put on your roots, it will leave them kind of oily.  put on just the ends and brush thru and you are good to go.. love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with very thick hair and it always takes me a really long time to blow dry my hair! I always just let it dry over night and then if I had time blow dry it in the morning and it still would take me 20 to 30 minutes to finish it. I went to a very good friend of mine who gave me a very lovely new hair do and it only took her at the most 15 to 20 minutes to blow dry my hair. I thought wow I need to know her trick and she said this spray is a miracle and I bought it. It now only takes me about 20 minutes to blow dry my hair and just a few sprays!!! Talk about one happy person, no need for me to go outside with wet or damp hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve gone thru so many products and by far this beats it.... I had gotten hair extensions well it damaged my hair and not only that it also shortened it. If I would of known. My hairstylist told me that the tape extensions will not damage it. Oh boy, was she wrong..&lt;br /&gt;So, immediately I looked for hair products and started googling it. and found this one. Plus I bought the volume shampoo and hydrated conditioner and mask leave it.. Love these products. I get compliments on my hair no how healthy it looks .. Love it..</li>
    <li> Nice spray and keeps hair protected during drying process.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend that was using the product. I&#x27;m often rushing to get ready in the morning and sometimes it takes a while to blow dry my below the shoulders hair. I actually purchased some shampoo and received the blow dry spray for free. I was skeptical but was surprised at how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to take a shower, get ready, and take my boys to school and come home to dry my hair. I tried putting the blow dry spray in my hair before I took my sons to school but found when I came home my hair was TOO dry. I couldn&#x27;t blow dry it out properly. That is how well it worked. So instead I come home and spray my hair. Then get my daughter&#x27;s breakfast and put on my makeup THEN dry my hair and I spend a lot less time blow drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has really helped save time in the morning. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair at night so it will dry a little faster before she goes to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells AMAZING! I know keep a bottle of this in my beauty arsenal at all times!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to everyone. I use it daily and definetly cut the time in half when blow drying my hair. Try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Leave in conditioner, detangler and more.  Highly recommend - I have thin and dry hair, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or limp - just right - I love it!</li>
    <li> A good straightening, styling agent, makes hair shiny as well.You can use it with wet or dry hair and a blow dryer or flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It leaves my hair very silky and definitely cuts down on the time I am using the blow dryer.  I just spray it on my towel dried hair, do my makeup and then blow dry.  It also reduces the amount of flat ironing I have to do!</li>
    <li> I like that this is a light weight spray and does not leave the hair oily at all! The hair def dries faster!</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it!!!!!  Absolutely amazing for women that are grey.  Keeps the hair from turning a yucky yellow.  MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems to really protect my hair.  It is worth the money over the store brands for sure.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Protects your hair and leaves it feeling soft and silky.  It is definitely worth the price.  Smells wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of hair products. This stuff is GREAT. It smells really good and it makes my hair soft, detangles it, and makes it come out really well after styling. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> It does not work.  It takes the a same amount of time to dry my hair.  I do love the smell though.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
    <li> I used this product for several weeks and when I needed more I searched Amazon to check price comparisons.  I got the same product for a fraction of what I paid at a salon.  I recommend the spray because it adds manageability and heat protection, but is very light and never makes hair sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> Great to help keep fine hair in good shape!</li>
    <li> Always a needed product in our female dominated house! My daughter and I both use it to keep our hair shiny and damage free from blow drying and styling. I&#x27;ve used it for years and could not be happier with it!</li>
    <li> My hair is incredibly frizzy and this product smooths my hair and makes it look so healthy!  I look like my stylist had worked on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes hair manageable . I would recommend this product to everyone I know. And I do recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that used to take me 20-30 minutes to blow dry! It used to get so hot and exhausting. After combing my hair, I spray this and then blow dry. I seriously timed how long it took me-now 10-15 minutes! if I use an couple extra sprays the time is less.</li>
    <li> I use this spray daily, it truly does make a difference. It takes me over 6 moths to use it all. You can&#x27;t drench you hair in it because it will make your hair appear greasy. I received this for a gift about two years ago and it&#x27;s been a part of my daily routine ever since. Since I&#x27;ve been out the last two days my hair is dry again. It&#x27;s amazing how well this works. I highly recommend it. I also think it smells good too, I hate putting hair product in that doesn&#x27;t smell good. I love Kenra products, they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair that I blow dry to straighten it.  This product made my hair look oily and stringy.  I&#x27;ve tried using minimal amounts (one spray for each side of my head).  I&#x27;ve tried spraying onto the palms of my hands and lightly working it into just the ends.  Any way I apply it, I get oil.  On my hands, I do get a slippery silicone feel.  This might be fabulous for thicker hair, but it did not work on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Worked for a while on my hair then it got to where my hair looked terrible after using it so I quit using it gave it to my daughter. Unfortunately she said the same thing. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Cuts blow dry time in half. Just need a little bit,..smells great! Light spray that detangles as well. Will use again.</li>
    <li> I hear such great things about the Kenra line of products, but man. My experiences with them haven&#x27;t lived up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is super-oily.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly. I love the Kenra Platinum spray. I have been using it for the past 3 years and it works great!</li>
    <li> Product as described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Works as advertised - significantly reduces the hair breakage and cuts the blow dry time by at least a third. The smell is mildly reminiscent of a coconut. I recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Tends to make my hair greasy faster than usual.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It works just like described. Only need a few spritz which goes a long way. I use 3 sprays and my hair is to the middle of my back.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair care products, and I have used a TON of them. I have very long and thick hair that likes to frizz. Not only is this great for before blow drying, and as a detangler, but it is great for after styling too. I like to use wavers and curling devices a lot, and afterwards my hair can look a little frizzy, dry, and bushy. I spray this on it afterwards and it makes my hair silky, frizz free, and makes my curls and waves look amazing. When you apply it to dry hair it may look a little oily for the first minute or so but it dries and the results are awesome. You don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts a good amount of time. I think it is totally worth the price and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray is the best product, it straightens my hair, as well gives it an awesome shine.</li>
    <li> This is my alltime favorite hair product! It smells great, is lightweight, and speeds drying time. Try it! I bought the large bottle because I will use it after showers and at night if I need a little anti-friz.</li>
    <li> This has really made my hair feel better and stay healthy longer.  I don&#x27;t notice it drying faster, but it really does seem to protect well.  I would highly recommend.  I have been using for several months now.</li>
    <li> I have noticed some improvement in amount of time it takes to blow dry my long hair however I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the damage I have noticed over the past few months. It claims it protects from heat also but I have noticed a difference in my hair and this has been the only hair product change I have made. I am now going back to a heat guard product instead.</li>
    <li> i typically purchase the Kenra products from my hair stylist and it was starting to get expensive, when i found this on Amazon i was thrilled at the price but, i thought well this will take a while to receive but to my surprise i received the item very quickly and it was in perfect condition</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron spray! Makes my hair so soft also!</li>
    <li> This is great product ! This is what can do : 1- cut the time of socked wet hair in blow dry to half!&lt;br /&gt;2- leaves your hair shinny and very light&lt;br /&gt;3- untangled hair&lt;br /&gt;4- not messy and you don&#x27;t need more than 3-4 spray on.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick medium waves and frizz .</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine hair that&#x27;s curly in spirals underneath but wavy on top so I blow dry it straight about five times a week. I&#x27;m soooo glad I found this product because it has cut my blow dry time in HALF!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally using the mist and asked somebody at Beauty Brands about the difference between the spray and the mist. She said that the mist is for people with super fine hair and suggested I use the spray. I think I&#x27;ll go back to the mist after I finish this bottle of spray because it does seem like my hair is getting oily a little faster. But overall I live both products.</li>
    <li> Best for my hair which tends to get frizzy. And smells like vacation!!  The Beach!!</li>
    <li> this stuff works great cuts dry time down so much!! and it smells great</li>
    <li> This product works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I wish it came I scented</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have super curly hair and this product works great at adding shine when using flat iron. Great deal and fast shipping. Will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> It does speed up dry time while de-tangling.</li>
    <li> I love this product and was very pleased overall with this transaction!  No room for improvement!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dry spray. It is not greasy. I really load it on my very dry hair and it leaves it soft ,shinny and silky. I will always use this.</li>
    <li> Good. Price was good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy from here, but I&#x27;ve used this and I love it. I have naturally curly/wavy long hair and I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday nor blow dry! But I use this to freshen it up. It gives it shine and the oils help the curls on second and third day hair...great!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My hair and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  My hair dries way quicker.  Also, I don&#x27;t like a lot of stuff on my hair, I&#x27;d prefer none; but this stuff is light and makes my hair super soft. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought this after my hair dresser used it on me in her shop. It cuts the dryer time down significantly on my hair. I have really thick hair and rarely blow dried it before because it would take so long and end up frizzy, but this stuff has changed everything!</li>
    <li> Cuts at least 1/3 off my drying time - wonderful!  I have thick hair to my waist, which I blow dry with a round brush.  With this product, I can get the job done in 17 minutes!</li>
    <li> This product is a little expensive, but it makes your hair really soft after you blow it dry.  It also protects it from the blow dryer.  Not so many split ends.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and makes your hair super shiny!  I think it actually does reduce my blow drying time substantially.  Definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff.  Helps protect hair from any damage from blow drying or flat or curling iron.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  Use it daily and it works!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works to smooth hair and Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I have dry, coarse hair and have tried everything to help with the frizzes.I love this brand and can no longer get this at my own salon. I found this by accident on Amazon. Love this product along with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the best blowdry spray I have ever tried, and the best price I&#x27;ve found for the larger size.  Hooray!</li>
    <li> I found Kenra Products from reading Audrey Davis-Sivasothy&#x27;s (author of The Science of Black Hair) hair articles on the Yahoo Contributor Network.  I decided to try this specific product because it has a lot of silicones in it.  My hair loves silicones and since I use a hair dryer and a pressing comb and a flat iron every time I do my hair, I really needed something to protect it.  In addition to the heat protection it adds a lot of shine to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for every phase of heat.  I spray it while it&#x27;s still wet and sit under the hooded dryer.  Then I spray it on my hair as I press each section, and again right before I flat iron it.  Yes, it is a LOT of spraying.  After I&#x27;m done, initially my hair looks stringy and oily.  Obviously because I just sprayed the crap out of it.  But the next day, it has all soaked into my hair, and my hair looks BEAUTIFUL!  The compliments are endless.  I was in a public restroom and an Armenian woman stopped me and said, \\&quot;Is that your real hair?  It is beautiful, how do you make it look like that?  I can never get my hair to look like that\\&quot;  I told her about the Kenra Heat Spray... hopefully she went and bought some.  But comments like that are very typical since I started using this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost.  Yes, this stuff is expensive at your local salon.  Amazon is the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found it.  I make the splurge every month and find justification for it when my husband runs his fingers through my hair and compliments on how shiny, bouncy, pretty, healthy, etc it is.</li>
    <li> This is grat stuff that is light and non greasy.  Most products of this type will quickly weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  An added bonus besides working well is that it has a fabulous, soft, lovely scent.</li>
    <li> The best invention ever</li>
    <li> Quality product recommended by my stylist at a much better price that the salon.</li>
    <li> This works great to help straighten your hair. It also helps to make your hair shinny.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with Kendra blow dry spray.  Was also happy about prompt delivery.  Will order Kendra products again</li>
    <li> Works great. Smells great. Helps cut the drying time down a lot!!! Definitely would recommend this. Just don&#x27;t use too much or too little or it won&#x27;t work out well! I use it with It&#x27;s A 10</li>
    <li> LOVE!  The scent is great and it cuts my hair drying in half.  This is one product I&#x27;m sticking with.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually seems to work and makes my hair smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My stylist had given me a sample to try and I loved it the first time I used it. It makes your hair so silky. I&#x27;ve wasted hundreds of dollars trying to find a product to reduce frizz. NOTHING worked as good as this. It is slightly expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to make your hair so smooth and healthy feeling. I definitely recommend this product. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Wife was very pleased with the product and says it is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This product protects my hair, making it soft and smooth.  The price here is terrrific.  I had purchased this product in a 3.4oz from a salon for about the same price.  Will return here for more.</li>
    <li> helps to reduce the dryness you get when you dry your hair or when you just throw rollers in it - helps reduce the stress on your hair. Love this stuff and cant go without it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMarie in the Springs...</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this for my 7 year old who has incredibly tangley, long hair.  It was a total nightmare getting through it after a shower, even with lots of conditioner. The kid de-tangling sprays never really did the job either. We were almost to the point where we were going to cut her hair off and this product was our last hope. It worked phenomenally. It only takes 3 sprays for her whole head and she can brush her hair by herself now with zero tears/fits. It has really changed our bath-time routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always rushing out the door at the last minute and this stuff is perfect for drying hair fast and leaving it smell great. One of Kenra&#x27;s best products!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not only does it smell so good, but it cuts the blow dry time nearly in half.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it before I flatiron my hair.  I have dry hair and this makes it so shiny!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hairdresser.  My hair has seemed so much healthier and shinier after using it.  It really protects from daily blow-drying.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! My hairdresser turned me on to this. I have very thick wavy hair that I love to straighten, however it takes so long to blow dry it before it is ready to flat iron. With this product I save lots and lots of time!</li>
    <li> Great product, I always buy at ULTA and it&#x27;s $33.00, a $6.00 savings + tax!  I Love any day, AND having it delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> Just like the thermal styling spray and the hair spray (that both go on dry hair) this product goes on wet hair and acts pretty much like a detangler - and in my opinion it is the best-smelling of all of them.</li>
    <li> This spray was recommended this spray and it claimed it cuts drying time. First of all it helps with tangled hair if you use it before brushing or combing. This product definitely works to shorten dry time and it doesnt leave any residue or sticky feel.</li>
    <li> I love all my kenra products but this one I use everytime I do my hair, I love the way it smells and it really does cut the blow dry time down and it makes my frizziness go away.. love love love it..</li>
    <li> I am a product junky and this one reaches the top of my list. I use it, as well as my daughter. It makes her dull and curly hair shine and it helps me to blow mine out straight and seems to add a silky protection without weighing it down. I love it!</li>
    <li> Does not reduce blow drying time by 50% as claimed, but helps with detangling and smells great!</li>
    <li> Bought a small bottle of this after it was recommended by my stylist.  This large bottle is SUCH a better deal.  Then I can just refill my small bottle.  This is great protection from blow drying &amp; flat ironing.  I think it does help your hair to dry faster.  No weird smell and does not leave hair with any texture.  You don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there.  Can use other styling products and just spray a little of this on before drying.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this spray on my hair one day and I fell in love with it.  It makes my hair so soft and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most products do.  Smells great, too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!!! Leaves my hair nice and silky without weighing down. I have fine hair so need something that won&#x27;t weigh it down. This does the trick! I love how straight it makes my hair when I want it that way. And even more, I love that I can make nice waves if I want. It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy which is a serious plus! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My favorite product. I can&#x27;t do my hair without it! I like all Kenra products.</li>
    <li> Cuts blow dry time immensely! smells nice too. A must have for long hair.</li>
    <li> I love the product and it works really well. The only draw back I can see is that I think it makes my face breakout in spots. You only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> Calms my mane, protects my hair, and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> This product gets all the frizziness and the extra poofiness i do not like. I have very fine thin hair and this product works great as a finishing touch. The only downside is if you skip a shower for a day my hair gets a little oily. Not a huge deal but still noteworthy.</li>
    <li> Smells great and shortens blue drying time</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!! The smell is to die for.......I have yet to find a perfume that has the same yummy fresh coconutty smell. This spray also gives a great shine to my hair while leaving it silky as well. A must buy!!</li>
    <li> really helps your hair dry faster... Kenra products are always solid in my opinion</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my hair more manageable and less frizzy. And it cuts my hair drying time down alot!</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel after I blow dry it!! It really helps control my fly aways and make my hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I began useing it after I had been to the hairdressers. Your hair does not dry out from the hairdryer&#x27;s heat. It also takes about half the time to dry your hair. This was packaged great so there was no leakage in the shipping and handling. It may be expensive, however it does last for a long time. I definitely will purchase this again from this company.</li>
    <li> It is ok. It was not a significant difference in my blowdry time and it left my hair more weighed down. It does smell great!  Instead, I spray it in my hands and rub the bottom of my hair for shine and protectant before I curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and Amazon prices beat ulta. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this spray. It actually helps my hair dry faster, that is why my stylist first used it on my hair. Less blow dry time. The scent is wonderful. I get complements on how good my hair smells. Make sure to spray it around and rub it in good. Too much in one area will leave a greasy spot.</li>
    <li> Works wonders!  Cuts my drying time by at least 30% if not more!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down. Makes it soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! My hair is about medium length and usually takes about 10-15 minutes to blow dry (and results in fly aways and dry looking hair). Well, I sprayed this stuff all over my head and it took 5 minutes to dry! My hair was so silky and styled perfectly afterwards!! I didn&#x27;t think that was possible but it worked like magic.</li>
    <li> OH my. This is the best money on a hair product I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.    For starters, I have wavy, light but thick blonde hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to get as healthy as possible after having done everything wrong on it in the past.  This summer I finally had between 8 and 12 inches of really healthy hair that I was excited to grow long.    Several weeks  ago I DAMAGED my hair AGAIN by swimming in a salt-water pool about 5 times over 2 weeks and not rinsing out the salt water right away.  My hair dried out so bad on the ends I was literally in tears!  I had to pretty much OIL it to keep the frizz down...making my hair look dark and kind of greasy.    My hairdresser trimmed off the worst 2 inches and used a product on it that made it feel like I had new hair!!  Soft, swingy, frizz-free, light, shiny, not weighted-down...perfect-appearing hair. I asked her what it was and it was this Kenra Blow-dry Spray.    Soooo...after a couple more times of needing to STILL put about 3 conditioners plus oil on my hair in order for it to look decent, I splurged and bought this product.    The first time I used it this morning I  was completely amazed!  It did what no OIL could do for my hair--made it stay soft and light and feel conditioned and smooth even after it dried. Yes it did also cut down on my blowdry time, but that is not the primary perk of this product, in my mind.    Now, I did apply the following products before I put the Kenra spray on, however, my hairdresser didn&#x27;t and my hair turned out perfect.  I was using Miracle 7 Keratin deep conditioner on it, the Neutrogena Hair Restore Mask, plus Tressemme split-end repair conditioner, AND the It&#x27;s A 10 silk balm on it....and NOTHING made it stay soft after it was dry other than this product.    BTW, this product has silicones in it and i KNOW it&#x27;s the \\&quot;in\\&quot; thing to think silicones are \\&quot;bad.\\&quot;  However, my understanding is that it coats the hair shaft and seals in the moisture, which is what you want. (just like lotion over damp skin). I think fears of it \\&quot;building up and suffocating\\&quot; your hair are silly because of course it won&#x27;t build up on your hair if you use a decent clarifying shampoo and WASH your hair on a regular basis...which I do.  Let me just say, if this is what silicones feel like, then I want silicones, for crying out loud.    This is the perfect product for dry damaged hair...you&#x27;ll swear you just got a new head of hair without waiting for it to grow out.  Thank you savvy folks at Kenra!!</li>
    <li> I have found the gold (platinum?) of all thermal styling sprays!!! This stuff is easy to apply (spray nozzle) and it has an ok scent (not my fave, but not awful). Not only has it drastically reduced my drying time, it also gives me some serious volume. This is a generous size bottle for a GREAT price! I would order it again and again!</li>
    <li> This works exactly as described. My hair stylist introduced me to this. Leaves my hair silky and shiny! Love it!</li>
    <li> Best product ever made! I lightly spray the ends of my hair when I&#x27;m done flat ironing it. It looks greasy at first but my hair soaks it up &amp; looks great &amp; not weighed down after about 5 minutes. My hair is super dry without it but looks like normal hair with this product. Sometimes I let my hair air dry &amp; spray a light mist to tame the frizzies.</li>
    <li> First of all, this stuff smells like heaven. I love the coconut scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger enough to be overpowering once my hair is dry. It does seem to help quite a bit to keep my hair smoother, and as long as I only use it on the length of my hair, and not the top, it doesn&#x27;t get too greasy. I did notice a slight difference in the amount of time it took me to blow dry my hair, which is nice, because I have A LOT of hair and blow drying it takes forever. I will definitely buy more of this.</li>
    <li> e used many thermal protectants and this one is the absolute best! I have thick,natural curly hair that frizzes up when it is humid, so to find this spray is wonderful!  If you want to take the curl or frizz out of your hair or to straighten it, then this is the spray you are looking for.  It is a little pricey but a little goes a long way. I spray it on hair while damp, then I blow dry it and style with a blow dryer styling  brush. My hair is soft, sleek, not frizzy and it smells great!  You can also buy it on drugstore.com.</li>
