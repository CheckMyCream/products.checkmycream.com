      <li>I have used shower to shower for about 10 years and like the breeze fresh with vanilla essence the best of the ones they offer</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon that I bought many</li>
      <li>I LOVE this powder!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this powder!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I thought to try Amazon!  </li>

      <li>glad to have found it!</li>
      <li>This is a nicely scented body powder without being too &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; or over-powering.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent and is refreshing and does well in summer and winter--year around!!</li>
      <li>Very good and consistent quality.</li>
      <li>Great product with nice fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a vanilla Body powder for some time, so I was delighted to fine it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>THIS POWDER DOES MORE THAN MAKE YOU SMELL NICE</li>
      <li>Smells great price was right, it does the job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and vanilla-y.</li>
      <li>They say it&#x27;s vanilla essence, but it is very light.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find this scent at any store.</li>
      <li>That said, it works soooo much better than alternative products.</li>
      <li>Hope they fix the top soon.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this in stores any more.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
      <li>I thought it would have more fragrance and be silkier.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and is so smooth.</li>
      <li>Eight dollars a bottle, come on Amazon, you can do better.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of vanilla and it does not bother my allergies.</li>
      <li>I love this powder and am so glad that you carry it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent for this product.</li>
      <li>I like this smell, but prefer the sport scent better.</li>
      <li>Happily, the product line has developed and expanded and gotten better.  </li>
      <li>The other one works beautifully, and is delightfully powdery, which is great, since I essentially paid double for it.</li>
      <li>Fine powdery feel.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment and love the smell.</li>
      <li>The Breeze Fresh Vanilla scent puts me in a better mood.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from the classic S2S powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This keeps me fresh and dry all day and the smell is very nice and light, but it&#x27;s not too strong to interfere with any colognes or perfumes.  </li>
      <li>Does anyone know if this is true?</li>
      <li>This also has nice soft scent.</li>
      <li>So, you see I have a true dilemma.</li>
      <li>The vanilla scent is light and fresh.</li>
      <li>The last I heard talc isn&#x27;t good for you.</li>
      <li>And this is super fumey.</li>
      <li>I love the way this particular powder absorbs odors.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very blonde and fine, so it looks oily very easily.</li>
      <li>COOL AND FRESH.</li>
      <li>It is so light and airy and really gives you a fresh and clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>Great for those summer months when you sweat a lot and want a little fragrance but nothing overpowering.</li>
      <li>This powder is so smooth, you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>BuT overall a nice product</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to smell like a cookie, just fresh.</li>
      <li>This particular scent is prevalent with a light vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>It will not close completely (nor open further), which is obviously the cause of the original powder disaster, but neither will the cap concede to my masterful attempts at forcible removal.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t bear to throw away good powder, but as it refuses to be shaken out in a useable manner, it is not really worth keeping.</li>
      <li>Breeze Fresh with Vanilla is my personal favorite</li>
      <li>I love to wear powder in the summer, it helps me to stay cool and dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this powder for many years and this is the only place that I can find it.</li>
      <li>Using this everyday keeps me worry free and satisfied that this product lives up to its name.</li>
      <li>One is fine; the &amp;#34;evil twin&amp;#34; still contains a great deal of powder as judged by weight, and I&#x27;d hoped to be able to transfer it to a different container, but alas, the mechanics of the twist open cap defy known laws of physics.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to condition well afterwards, because it will dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>I use this as a dry shampoo and love it.</li>
      <li>Corn starch is the first ingredient but talc is up there as a main ingredient.</li>
      <li>Really like this powder and can&#x27;t ever find it at the stores around here.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really smell it once you&#x27;re dressed</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>i just love the fresh small and that it gives after a hot shower.</li>
      <li>This kind of S2S powder is so clean and fresh; I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find in local stores.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>and I like the silky smooth and dry feel on my skin.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t clump, and I especially like the light fragrance this one offers.  </li>
      <li>You only need a small amount and it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>It helps to stay fresh through a long day and to reduce chafing.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a powder to help keep me fresh during long days of work and night classes, and this does the trick!</li>
      <li>This has a lovely, delicate scent</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s by far the nicest, mildest, clean-smelling fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why more people don&#x27;t use body powders in lieu of deodorants especially during cooler days.  </li>
      <li>arrived ahead of anticipated schedule and what exactly what was expected to arrive...</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy, it&#x27;s a true powder .  </li>
      <li>Some of the other versions of Shower to Shower powder smell excessively strong, sharp or floral.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy it in local stores but it has become harder and harder to find particularly in the Island Fresh and Vanilla scents.  </li>
      <li>It is smooth with a delicate scent that does not over power.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few kinds of shower to shower, along with a few other powders, but this scent is by far my favorite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells nice, not overwhelming.  Cap is hard to turn. Hope they fix the top soon.</li>
    <li> Silky, smells gooood and a little goes a long way!  I&#x27;ve used the CVS brand of tShower to Shower and it was my abosute fav,  but they have since slowed on selling it or it is harder to keep shelved.  Either way its harder to find, but I understand why - its awesome!</li>
    <li> This stiff cost one dollar at the dollar tree.&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores any more. It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> Quick shipment and love the smell. Just as expected. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this powder. The Breeze Fresh Vanilla scent puts me in a better mood. It&#x27;s overpriced but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else. Eight dollars a bottle, come on Amazon, you can do better.</li>
    <li> This kind of S2S powder is so clean and fresh; I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> Great product with nice fresh smell.  (hard to find bath powder in stores these days, but you can always find what you want at Amazon.)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent for this product. It helps to stay fresh through a long day and to reduce chafing.</li>
    <li> A little overpriced, but this fragrance is impossible to find. The powder did leak the wrapping so a little messy inside the box. But same quality</li>
    <li> This one is hard to find on the shelf - but it&#x27;s by far the nicest, mildest, clean-smelling fragrance.  Some of the other versions of Shower to Shower powder smell excessively strong, sharp or floral.  This one is just pleasant.  I use it every day and always order online.</li>
    <li> Great product have used it before and always been happy with it!!!</li>
    <li> This powder is excellent value.  It is smooth with a delicate scent that does not over power.  Works well in the summer heat.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this powder! I hate I can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
    <li> I remember when Shower to Shower only had one scent.  They soon came out with another scent that was a bit generic.  Happily, the product line has developed and expanded and gotten better.  This particular scent is prevalent with a light vanilla scent.  It&#x27;s a nice change from the classic S2S powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very nice and mellow scent from a powder standby that really is a nice scent alternative.</li>
    <li> arrived ahead of anticipated schedule and what exactly what was expected to arrive...thanks</li>
    <li> I love the way this particular powder absorbs odors.  You only need a small amount and it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> This has a lovely, delicate scent but I was disappointed to read that the ingredients include talc. Corn starch is the first ingredient but talc is up there as a main ingredient. The last I heard talc isn&#x27;t good for you. Does anyone know if this is true?</li>
    <li> can not find this scent in the stores and it is my farovite</li>
    <li> Unfortunately one of these containers was damaged. Both were bundled together and tightly wrapped in plastic. I could see there was powder under the plastic and of course it went everywhere as I freed them from captivity. One is fine; the &amp;#34;evil twin&amp;#34; still contains a great deal of powder as judged by weight, and I&#x27;d hoped to be able to transfer it to a different container, but alas, the mechanics of the twist open cap defy known laws of physics. It will not close completely (nor open further), which is obviously the cause of the original powder disaster, but neither will the cap concede to my masterful attempts at forcible removal. I can&#x27;t bear to throw away good powder, but as it refuses to be shaken out in a useable manner, it is not really worth keeping. It also seems ridiculous to go to the trouble to send back so that another innocent person can be covered in powder.  So, you see I have a true dilemma. The other one works beautifully, and is delightfully powdery, which is great, since I essentially paid double for it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  doesn&#x27;t clump, and I especially like the light fragrance this one offers.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> what I expected, but expensive</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells and I like the silky smooth and dry feel on my skin. No more chaffing skin. I only have to reapply a few times between showers. I&#x27;m sad that I will not be able to get this powder scent here. Please Amazon don&#x27;t stop selling this powder scent. I&#x27;ve been using this powder for many years and this is the only place that I can find it. Not everyone gets sick from using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I was looking for a powder to help keep me fresh during long days of work and night classes, and this does the trick! It smells amazing and is so smooth. I feel like a chinchilla taking a dust bath in it - I want it everywhere! It&#x27;s also great for freshening and degreasing my hair.</li>
    <li> feels silky, however scent is a bit too vanilla for me BuT overall a nice product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t get this in the store anymore?  I love to wear powder in the summer, it helps me to stay cool and dry.  Nothing worse then feeling sweaty and sticky when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
    <li> It has a light scent and is refreshing and does well in summer and winter--year around!!</li>
    <li> glad to have found it! nobody in my town  has it</li>
    <li> i just love the fresh small and that it gives after a hot shower. the small is so relaxing after a long days of work.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 bottles and both spill out powder from the side of the cap, regardless of if it is in the open or closed position.  Lots is wasted on the floor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why more people don&#x27;t use body powders in lieu of deodorants especially during cooler days.  This keeps me fresh and dry all day and the smell is very nice and light, but it&#x27;s not too strong to interfere with any colognes or perfumes.  I like this smell, but prefer the sport scent better.</li>
    <li> Really like this powder and can&#x27;t ever find it at the stores around here.  It isn&#x27;t heavy, it&#x27;s a true powder .  Even baby powder is heavier and clumpy by comparison.  This also has nice soft scent. You can&#x27;t really smell it once you&#x27;re dressed so it  doesn&#x27;t conflict with perfumes or whatever you want to smell like</li>
    <li> I have been using Shower to Shower powder for years.  I used to buy it in local stores but it has become harder and harder to find particularly in the Island Fresh and Vanilla scents.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon that I bought many so I won&#x27;t have to go from store to store hunting for it.  It was delivered to my door and now my shelf is stocked.  It was a good price. Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
    <li> I use this as a dry shampoo and love it. I find it works best to apply it at night before bed, then let it soak in overnight. Brush out in the morning to remove powdery residue and I&#x27;m good to go! I used to buy this at the grocery store, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it there lately. It&#x27;s a better bargain on here anyway! The 2-pack will last me for 6+ months at the minimum.</li>
    <li> Smells great price was right, it does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a long lasting product that does what it says.  Using this everyday keeps me worry free and satisfied that this product lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> Great fragrant baby powder product. Fine powdery feel. Great for those summer months when you sweat a lot and want a little fragrance but nothing overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have used shower to shower for about 10 years and like the breeze fresh with vanilla essence the best of the ones they offer</li>
    <li> This is a good, neutral smelling bath powder.  The container, however, is difficult to use.  It is hard to control the open/close option.  The price was excellent.</li>
    <li> Why this scent was discontinued is beyond my comprehension.  It is so light and airy and really gives you a fresh and clean feeling.  Bring back this scent please!</li>
    <li> I thought it would have more fragrance and be silkier.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely scented body powder without being too &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; or over-powering.  The vanilla scent is light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do any research on talcum powder before this purchase (or until I used a few times - eek!) Shame on me for that. But talc is known to be bad for you. And this is super fumey. You can feel it in your nose/mouth/eyes long after application. It&#x27;s also a pain to get off of clothing. That said, it works soooo much better than alternative products. I still got rid of mine. It&#x27;s not worth the risk. But if not opposed to the risk, this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> THIS POWDER DOES MORE THAN MAKE YOU SMELL NICE, IT HELPS WITH CHAFING, SWEATING, AND KEEPS YOU COOL AND FRESH.</li>
    <li> I guess I must be one of the few people who use body powder.  There is usually a poor selection in stores, and even this popular brand is getting harder &amp; harder to find.  I only saw this scent in one store and now it is not even there anymore.  I&#x27;m so glad I thought to try Amazon!  You get lots of powder at a great price with Shower to Shower.  Breeze Fresh with Vanilla is my personal favorite</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a vanilla Body powder for some time, so I was delighted to fine it on Amazon. I love the scent of vanilla and it does not bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> I love this powder and am so glad that you carry it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this powder! I have not been able to find this scent at any store. They say it&#x27;s vanilla essence, but it is very light. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a cookie, just fresh. This powder is so smooth, you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a repeat purchase. No surprises. Very good and consistent quality. Will be happy to buy again. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I use shower to shower in my hair on mornings that I wake up and don&#x27;t have time to shower. My hair is very blonde and fine, so it looks oily very easily. The powder soaks up the oil and actually adds some volume to my hair, making it look thicker. I&#x27;ve tried a few kinds of shower to shower, along with a few other powders, but this scent is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s very light and vanilla-y. I&#x27;m not sure if other people use it for hair, but if you need a quick fix for a rushed morning, I would definitely recommend trying it! Just make sure to condition well afterwards, because it will dry out your hair.</li>
