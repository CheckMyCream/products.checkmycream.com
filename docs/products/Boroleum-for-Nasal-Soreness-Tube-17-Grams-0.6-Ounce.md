      <li>They say my review is too short, but what more needs to be said?</li>
      <li>I was reading up on him some time ago &amp; found that on a lot of his movies that he did not earn a large salary.  </li>
      <li>My father has since reported a significant improvement in his nasal packages, with regard to scabbing and general comfort.  </li>
      <li>It is very soothing.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Very soothing.</li>
      <li>It really works....</li>
      <li>Very helpful.</li>
      <li>menthol smell is very soothing and it really clears your sinus passages.</li>
      <li>This is the greatest when you get a cold.</li>
      <li>I have always used this product and really appreciate how well it works.  </li>
      <li>Constantly wiping my nose usually leaves a sore, red mark under or on my nose, this is the greatest stuff to heal when you get one.</li>
      <li>Works better than other products.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this since I was a little girl; it was my grandmother&#x27;s favorite treatment for the &amp;#34;red nose&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Great product that moisturizes a dry nose and keeps it from getting sore on flights or in other dry conditions.</li>
      <li>It was kind of hard to find in my area, and even though the drugstore could order it, it became a hassle!</li>
      <li>But the bonus is that the ingredients actually CLEAR up the congestion</li>
      <li>I started using it when my children were young and will never be without it.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased when I purchased Boroleum for Nasal Soreness previously from a small drug store in Queens, New York.</li>
      <li>I have used this item in the past for several years and will continue as I am pleased with it&#x27;s results.</li>
      <li>really works for dry nose</li>
      <li>I have been using Boroleum for at least 16 years and have recommended it to many of my friends, which they use on a daily basis for some reason.</li>
      <li>not that extreme but pretty close for your nose</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, and one tube lasts a long time</li>
      <li>and we keep at least one or two tubes available  in the nightstand to keep our lips and noses moist while we sleep.</li>
      <li>no brainer buy this no regrets.</li>
      <li>Product is very hard to find in local drugstores, so I&#x27;m really glad I can get it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>No other product works like Boroleum for nasal soreness to instantly provide relief.  </li>

<li> First off I must have tried at least two dozen products over the years for my winter sore nose and none come close to this one it sooths and heals the inner nose life saver maybe</li>
<li> IT IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS DURING THE WINTER WHEN MY NOSE GETS SO DRY THAT IT ACTUALLY HURTS.  </li>
<li> I use daily when traveling, especially during the winter, when the air is so dry.</li>
<li> If you have dry sinuses and cannot breathe at night, I would definitely recommend this product.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s the only thing that works in the winter for the inside of my dry, sore nostrils..</li>
<li> It lasts me quite a long time--perhaps 8-12 months per tube.</li>
<li> but I think it helps to cut down on the chance of catching a cold with all the coughing and sneezing of felllow passengers.  </li>
<li> I also used  to spend time in Colorado and it helped in dealing with the dry climate in the mountains.</li>
<li> This product saves me from the itchy, dry and sometimes bleeding noses.  </li>
<li> Keeps dry noses moist in the winter.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this ointment for years for my dry stuffy nose.</li>
<li> Wake up and your nose isn&#x27;t dry</li>
<li> My nose gets sore easily when I have a cold.  </li>
<li> I used to use it only in the winter, but have now been needing it year &#x27;round because of dryness.</li>
<li> He also told me \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This seems to work pretty good for my nasal problem.  It has caused some healing.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve had 4 sinus surgeries and along with neti pot (Neil med battery operated one w/ salt packets), and Boroleum I&#x27;ve had tremendous improvement. This is really helping me with congestion and bloody nose from the dry winter air even though I have a humidifier going. Just wish I would have found it sooner</li>
    <li> Thank you, very fast delivery. Well received. AA+</li>
    <li> The stuff works for me!</li>
    <li> First off I must have tried at least two dozen products over the years for my winter sore nose and none come close to this one it sooths and heals the inner nose life saver maybe not that extreme but pretty close for your nose no brainer buy this no regrets.</li>
    <li> this was an item we could not find in local drug stores, but Amazon had it. It really works....helps me  avoid post nasal drip and allergy symptoms....which were apparently caused by dry air/dry passages. Now I woulld not be caught without it.  amazon sells them with two per package, so I keep one in my purse, one at home.</li>
    <li> When nothing else works and I&#x27;m about to tear my nose off from rubbing, this soothes and smells good.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I lived in Maine. It does not let my nose get all bloody.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for nasal soreness and dryness. It is very soothing. Good for chapped and dry lips also. Product is very hard to find in local drugstores, so I&#x27;m really glad I can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> When you are having sinus issues this is the product to use.</li>
    <li> My father in on oxygen 24/7 and because of the nasal airflow, he had told me that he gets terrible drying, scabbing and soreness in his nose and asked me to look for a product for him.  After some online research I found this, then checked online for availability. Of course, Amazon had it!  My father has since reported a significant improvement in his nasal packages, with regard to scabbing and general comfort.  He also told me \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;, so I would definitely recommend, especially to those like my father, who are oxygen dependent,</li>
    <li> this stuff is great for a dry nowe.  I also use it before getting on a plane.  I think it protects me from the poor air quality on the plane</li>
    <li> Love this product and seller was great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this ointment for years for my dry stuffy nose. I also use it for other skin irritations. It lasts me quite a long time--perhaps 8-12 months per tube. I used to use it only in the winter, but have now been needing it year &#x27;round because of dryness. Very soothing. I just wish they&#x27;d change the tube to a plastic instead of metal: sometimes it can split and leak before I&#x27;ve finished using it. But I still will have gotten many, many months use out of it before that happens. (And I still continue to use it anyway: I just leave the cap on and take the ointment from the split--because I&#x27;m a cheapo. ;-)</li>
    <li> My nose has been driving me crazy with how dry and raw it is.  I have tried everything and nothing has worked until this.  This is awesome.  I brings moisture back to nasal area.  Super stuff!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor for nasal dryness, especially during the winter months. I put some in with a q tip every night, and what a difference it makes. I am going to use it when flying!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I was a little girl; it was my grandmother&#x27;s favorite treatment for the &amp;#34;red nose&amp;#34; caused by a cold.  If you try it, you will reach for it every time you suffer from a cold or sinus infection. It is the BEST!</li>
    <li> I would recommend not just for nasal soreness, but for scrapes,minor burns, chaffing of the skin, etc... I have been using Boroleum for at least 16 years and have recommended it to many of my friends, which they use on a daily basis for some reason. I had never heard of Boroleum until seeing an Advertisment in a magazine at work years ago,I was having bad sinus problems and nothing seemed to help with my nasal congestion, so my pharamist ordered a tube for me, from then on I have been using it regularly, and got my family hung onto it, so therefore when I order on-line, I purchase several tubes to give to my children and grandchildren.  My granddaughters are always asking, &amp;#34;Nonie, do you have any more Boroleum&amp;#34; ? I&#x27;m out of it!!!!!!  Signed: Lillian, wife of John.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago, and for some reason which I still don&#x27;t know why, I stopped. It was kind of hard to find in my area, and even though the drugstore could order it, it became a hassle! I had tried other stuff, but NOTHING compares to this! And the cool thing is that you can put it right in your nasal passages to help relieve dryness. But the bonus is that the ingredients actually CLEAR up the congestion and you breathe easier! I LOVE this stuff and since I can get it on Amazon now, will stock up!!!</li>
    <li> Need this! Great for the inside of a dry nose. I buy 3 at a time, love the product.</li>
    <li> Great to put in your nose to go to bed. Wake up and your nose isn&#x27;t dry</li>
    <li> Living in a humid location, I get terrible dry nasal passages when traveling to less humid places.  This product saves me from the itchy, dry and sometimes bleeding noses.  I religiously use it when traveling by air since I noticed it made the flight a lot more comfortable.  No sneezing and that horrible dried up feeling.  I can&#x27;t definitely attest to it medically but I think it helps to cut down on the chance of catching a cold with all the coughing and sneezing of felllow passengers.  I use daily when traveling, especially during the winter, when the air is so dry.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but I just kept forgetting to write my review.  I have been using Boroleum for dryness in my nose.  I have been using Boroleum for several years.  I like it better than Vicks or Vaseline.  I also have been enjoying War and Remembrance.  I have always like Robert Mitchum.  I was reading up on him some time ago &amp; found that on a lot of his movies that he did not earn a large salary.  It was a pittance salary even when he was the star. Thank you for reminding me about writing my review for these items.  Ruby L. Tanner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Boroleum for years and it&#x27;s the only thing that works in the winter for the inside of my dry, sore nostrils.. Everyone should have a tube on hand. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the drug stores.. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have always used this product and really appreciate how well it works.  Thank you.  That is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> Use ordinary petroleum jelly this stuff burns like crazy.  I had my doubts when I read the ingredients.  You have been warned.</li>
    <li> I have very dry sinuses that caused my nose to bleed but a little dab of this product on a q-tip to lubricate my nose did the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the rave reviews, but I have no idea why others think this is a great product. Seriously, the menthol smell is beyond intense &amp; worse, it BURNS upon application! Not soothing at all!!! You could mix Vicks with Neosporin and get the same result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!&lt;br /&gt;It works great for chapped lips as well, the only product that helps!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF FOR STUFFED OR DRY NOSES. HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS,BUT CAN NOT FIND IN THE DRUGSTORE ANY LONGER.  ALSO GOOD FOR SLIGHT SKIN IRRITATION. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Boroleum has become a winter stapel in our household and we keep at least one or two tubes available  in the nightstand to keep our lips and noses moist while we sleep.</li>
    <li> My nose gets sore easily when I have a cold.  I was very pleased when I purchased Boroleum for Nasal Soreness previously from a small drug store in Queens, New York. I have been unable to find it again since leaving New York. It was wonderful when I used it previously.  That is why I purchased two tubes.  I want to be prepared, if I need it and I will share with family members.</li>
    <li> IT IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS DURING THE WINTER WHEN MY NOSE GETS SO DRY THAT IT ACTUALLY HURTS.  IT HELPS BREATHING EASIER TOO.</li>
    <li> I sleep with a CPAP system and this salve is very handy to keep your nose dialed in. I also used  to spend time in Colorado and it helped in dealing with the dry climate in the mountains.</li>
    <li> Great product that moisturizes a dry nose and keeps it from getting sore on flights or in other dry conditions. Also creates a barrier against airborne germs.</li>
    <li> Can breathe at night!  Works better than other products.  If you have dry sinuses and cannot breathe at night, I would definitely recommend this product.  Very helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for more than 60 years.  Very effective for nasal soreness and other uses. They say my review is too short, but what more needs to be said?</li>
    <li> This ointment is another of my tried and true, standby, go-to products I buy regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot by airplane and smooshing some of this up my nose helps with not only counteracting the drying effects of the air quality in airplane cabins, but I&#x27;ve noticed I get less of that weird &amp;#34;creeping crud&amp;#34; you know, the weird head cold type stuff you get on airplanes breathing in that recycled air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s great for wintertime nasal dryness, too. Good for chapped lips and skin. I keep a tube of this at work, a tube of it at home, a tube of it in my travel bag for vacations. You name it. A little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s economical and truly works great.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest when you get a cold. Constantly wiping my nose usually leaves a sore, red mark under or on my nose, this is the greatest stuff to heal when you get one. Heals cold sores quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;The menthol smell is very soothing and it really clears your sinus passages. Keeps dry noses moist in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have used this item in the past for several years and will continue as I am pleased with it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product. Have been using it for years. Every time I used to get a cold my nose would crack and bleed from the repeated nose dripping/blowing. This stuff is wonderful so soothing and menthol helps you breathe better. Plus it&#x27;s great in the winter for the dry air to keep your nasal passages from drying out. Highly recommend, and one tube lasts a long time so it&#x27;s well worth the price. I know some would say you could just use petrolatum jelly which I used to use but I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of it. I kind of like the menthol smell reminds me of Vick&#x27;s vapor rub from being a kid.</li>
    <li> This is great. Not sure I can say anymore than other reviewers - just suffice it to say that I would recommend you give it a try.  Very good product..</li>
    <li> No other product works like Boroleum for nasal soreness to instantly provide relief.  I started using it when my children were young and will never be without it.  Recently we were on vacation in Florida and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so now I keep one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I am 67 and have used this product for over 60 years. It has never changed which makes it an amazing product. It clears up stuffy noses and heals the worse cold sore. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they stopped making it.</li>
    <li> really works for dry nose</li>
    <li> Great product to have.  I put a little bit on my pinkie and shove it up my nose.  I have found relief.</li>
    <li> Mom turned me on to this years ago was paying a big price from another company this is the best price and works absolutely fantastic for nasal dryness can not literally live with out it ok I could but not comfortably</li>
    <li> Bought this for a cousin who can&#x27;t find this in France (or it&#x27;s way way way too expensive, I forget). He is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> When traveling to high desert terrain, we suffer from extreme nasal dryness/allergy symptoms.  This product works better than the more oily, runny products and for less cost.  Highly effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using boroleum for years, especially when my allergies are acting up. It is so nice that I can get this through amazon.</li>
    <li> The hard-to-find product arrived quickly and was exactly what we wanted.</li>
</ol>
