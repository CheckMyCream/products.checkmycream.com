      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m liking the convenience more and more.  </li>
      <li>I use the trimmer most of the time.</li>
      <li>A charging cord would have been better.</li>
      <li>Gives a really clean close shave Cleans very easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to do a great job right under my nose, and how to trim my sideburns straight across.</li>
      <li>Amazing how much quicker, more comfortable this shaver is.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Why i havenot the jet clean system????</li>
      <li>clean system&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Get a clean, close shave.</li>
      <li>The listing photos for the item I purchased showed the &amp;#34;jet clean system&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Did not come with all the parts got 2 sent to me and neither were right</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, flip open head and rinse.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if they were all released by a single button.</li>
      <li>Absolutely 5 stars, right?  </li>
      <li>The charger is super easy: just drop the razor onto the stand and it starts charging and tells you how much time is left on the battery.</li>
      <li>The detail was in the fine print by never mentioning the Jet Clean System other than in the photo.  </li>
      <li>that costs up to twice as much as the shaver itself.</li>

      <li>(i) one (RQ12+) of much inferior design and quality; and (ii)</li>
      <li>I used an older Norelco shaver before I got this.</li>
      <li>Occasionally, pull head, disassemble each of three blades, clean, wait to dry, be sure each blade goes back to its previous head because if you mix them up they are custom fit and will hurt you.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased several on the new style Norelco shavers in the past few years and they are great.  </li>
      <li>The huge downside and why I only gave this razor one star, is due to the over priced replacement heads.</li>
      <li>It is also a little tricky to clean, as each blade&#x27;s holder folds up separately.</li>
      <li>It looks fragile, and my last Norelco lasted for nearly 10 years.</li>

<li> Well....  Bad news, the head for the razor is no longer made</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just cancelled my order for this thing after reading the reviews indicating that there are basically two replacement heads: (i) one (RQ12+) of much inferior design and quality; and (ii) the other (RQ12) that costs up to twice as much as the shaver itself.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Wrong charger came with the shaver, otherwise a 5 star.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is really nice.  But the sideburn trimmer is too small compared to Norelco&#x27;s previous models.  The huge downside and why I only gave this razor one star, is due to the over priced replacement heads.</li>
    <li> This razor is marvelous, so why one star?  Well, I&#x27;ve owned it for two years, and it was fantastic - best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Close shave in one or two passes, no pulling, no skin burn.  Easy to clean, flip open head and rinse.  Occasional run razor in soapy water, then flip open and rinse.  Done.  Absolutely 5 stars, right?  Well....  Bad news, the head for the razor is no longer made - Norelco has a RQ12+ replacement for the RQ12, and so I bought it for my yearly replacement head.  Ouch, it nips, pulls, burns skin, and still isnt as close as the RQ12.  But wait, theres more!  Cleaning instructions, pull head off the body, rinse both, lay separate to dry.  Occasionally, pull head, disassemble each of three blades, clean, wait to dry, be sure each blade goes back to its previous head because if you mix them up they are custom fit and will hurt you.  Truly, the instructions say this.  Tempted to buy this razor just to get the RQ12 replacement head (assuming they dont bate and switch from the picture) but the cose of $170 seems a little steep.  At any rate, my recommendation is one star and consider yourself informed and warned.</li>
    <li> Why i havenot the jet clean system???? and my pag is broken???</li>
    <li> Take a look for the price of the replacement heads prior to buy this expensive shaver!</li>
    <li> Works as promised. I use the trimmer most of the time. The charger is super easy: just drop the razor onto the stand and it starts charging and tells you how much time is left on the battery.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Gives a really clean close shave Cleans very easily. The charger is a little awkward and takes up counter space. A charging cord would have been better.</li>
    <li> Good shaver its the best I have had.</li>
    <li> This razor is quiet and does not irritate my skin. It also does a decent job with my neck, which is always a tough spot. I do wonder how tough this device is. It looks fragile, and my last Norelco lasted for nearly 10 years. It is also a little tricky to clean, as each blade&#x27;s holder folds up separately. It would be nice if they were all released by a single button.</li>
    <li> After 50+ years using a blade, I decided to try this shaver.  It took about 2 weeks for it to work well, as stated in the instructions.  It does works well, holds a charge, and is very convenient.  I can&#x27;t quite get as close as I did with &amp;#34;cold (stainless) steel&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m liking the convenience more and more.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to do a great job right under my nose, and how to trim my sideburns straight across.</li>
    <li> Well designed and made. Very easy to use.  Long battery life.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Still not as close as a blade but does an acceptable job and saves water</li>
    <li> This was to replace a broken Arctech razor. Extremely happy with the price.</li>
    <li> I returned it, thought it had the cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> Did not come with all the parts got 2 sent to me and neither were right</li>
    <li> I used an older Norelco shaver before I got this. Amazing how much quicker, more comfortable this shaver is. Get a clean, close shave. Love it.</li>
    <li> The listing photos for the item I purchased showed the &amp;#34;jet clean system&amp;#34;.  This Deal of the Day item did not include the &amp;#34;jet clean system&amp;#34;.  The detail was in the fine print by never mentioning the Jet Clean System other than in the photo.  MY BAD!  I have purchased several on the new style Norelco shavers in the past few years and they are great.  I was disappointed in the description in the offer as well as the various offers with the different prices and packages for essentially the same shaver.</li>
