      <li>Light weight.</li>
      <li>Light weight</li>
      <li>It is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air.</li>
      <li>but it was no longer available.</li>
      <li>So, before I order it anywhere, I will check to see if it really isn&#x27;t available in stores.</li>
      <li>Gets way too hot for something to be used by a child!!  </li>
      <li>Dries my hair quickly.</li>
      <li>really liked the one I had for several years and want another one.</li>
      <li>I ordered this hair dryer so our young grand-daughters would have a cute \\&quot;pink\\&quot; hair dryer for us all to share when we are together.  </li>
      <li>and she still has her style and fun.</li>

      <li>Easy to hold and small enough to be easy to pack for a trip</li>

    <li> This hair dryer works great and is adorable.  The only bad point is that it&#x27;s not foldable for traveling, but I would still purchase it.</li>
    <li> SO I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I was pretty angry to realize that I paid double the price. I had no idea where to look for this dryer and of course my always trusting amazon had it but when I went to Target I saw it for 19.99. I am a little upset, probably fair game but nonetheless sad.</li>
    <li> I got this for christmas and I love it.  It is very high powered for being a Hello Kitty hair dryer.  I was surprised.  It is very cute with a great price.</li>
    <li> My daughter has this for her young girls. They live in NY and I am in Florida. When i went for visit i usee this blow dryer. i was thrilled with the results. for a small blow dryer it is powerful. i came home and ordered one. Actually i am goin to order another in case they stop making them.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer so our young grand-daughters would have a cute \\&quot;pink\\&quot; hair dryer for us all to share when we are together.  It arrived earlier than it was supposed to and made the surprise for the girls much more exciting than we had planned. The hairdryer works great. I would definitely order from these folks again!!</li>
    <li> My sister had a hair dryer just like this one and it broke. She had purchased it at Target but it was no longer available. I found it on Amazon and bought it for her. It was just what she was looking for!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter as a surprise. Waiting to give it to her. I know she will love it. She loves Hello Kitty.</li>
    <li> And she just loves it.  Not only does she like Hello Kitty, but pink is her &amp;#34;very mostest favoritest color in the whole world&amp;#34; as she puts it.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer it is one of the best hairdryers I have ever used in my life!  I ordered this for a friend who had one already but I should have kept it for myself as a back up incase my ever died but I had it for about 3 years now and nothing went wrong yet!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. It is her hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t have to use her mothers.</li>
    <li> This is a great two speed dryer that will brighten your day. Great price for a kitty item like this!</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed with any product I have ordered from amazon. I bought this for my grandaughter for her birthday and she loved it. She must be supervised when using it as she is only 4 yrs old.</li>
    <li> She is a lover of all things Hello Kitty and this hair dryer just happens to be a really good one.  Light weight and she still has her style and fun.</li>
    <li> and the Target item is NOT available in stores according to Target.com. So, before I order it anywhere, I will check to see if it really isn&#x27;t available in stores. If not, I can come back and order it here.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the one I had for several years and want another one. It was easy to handle and dried my hair very efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;^,,^&lt;~</li>
    <li> I loved my new hair dryer.  it way 2cute!!. it looks like a cute toy but works pretty good . I think it is pretty powerful. it dries up my hair extensions good :)</li>
    <li> Gets way too hot for something to be used by a child!!  We turned it on and visible red hot coils could be seen within seconds.  And the air was blistering hot.  I cannot see a younger child using this without adult supervision.  We returned it.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has very long hair and sometimes needs to be dried. She likes having her own hair dryer, and this model is not expensive. It gets the job done. It helps that she likes anything with hello kitty on it.</li>
    <li> It has a lot of power.  Easy to hold and small enough to be easy to pack for a trip</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has been using it to dry her hair ever since.  She really likes the hello kitty theme and it functions well.</li>
    <li> Soory to have to say I bought this for a Christmas gift for a little girl. As far as I know, it has been fine.</li>
    <li> Bought for our daughter for Xmas and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as a hair dryer should. Feel like I paid a reasonable price considering it is a Hello Kitty product. Color and design are exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it will hold up in the long run but it is routine for us to have to replace hair dryers every year or two so if this one goes that long, I will continue to be happy!</li>
    <li> made to last one year.</li>
    <li> Compact size. Powerful dryer. Light weight. Super cute hello kitty and pink. Dries my hair quickly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the same Hello Kitty hair dryer almost every day for 5 years. It is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air. I have thick long hair and it dries quickly and smoothly. I like it so much I have purchased several for gran-daughters, girl friends and once as a bridal shower gift. Everyone has elaborated on how much they like this product and a few have carried on the gift choice to their family and friends. I had purchased them at Target but now, thanks to my Amazon Prime Shipping, I don&#x27;t have to purchase, then spend money to ship</li>
    <li> Works great and my little girl loves having her own blow dryer! It is a very cute and functional blow dryer!</li>
