<li> I have trouble swallowing pills, but these go down easy!</li>

<li> It has strenghtened my nails and my hair is shiny, way less hair loss with new growth already - a month tomorrow.</li>

<li> I just love it and hate to be without.</li>
<li> Unfortunately my doctor had me stop taking these for a while since the capsules contain carrageenan, which can apparently cause inflammation, so I have to avoid these for the time being while I bring down the inflammation already present in my body (as a result of food allergies, not these capsules).</li>
<li> sometimes so I watch for it to go down in price</li>
<li> After about a months I noticed no hair in the sink after 3 months my hair was noticeable thicker and the bald spots were less noticeable.  </li>

<li> It was thick and basically gagged me.  </li>
<li> His Reynauld&#x27;s isn&#x27;t gone, but it is seriously improved.  </li>
<li> For years I was taking antacids ever night and had serious acid reflux.</li>
<li> I ordered this for my husband to try as part of a new supplement regimine for his Reynauld&#x27;s (very bad circulation in his fingers).  </li>
<li> This is the least expensive place I have found for this product.</li>
<li> My hair was so thin I was getting bald spots at 45!  </li>
<li> and my hair has grown like crazy.</li>
<li> , I think it helps a lot ,I haven&#x27;t had a bad spell with bronchitis since I started taking these</li>
<li> The breakage/shedding has decreased a LOT!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought it tasted yucky.  It was thick and basically gagged me.  To each his own...</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that its suppose to make your skin healthier.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin on my face, I used it for little over a month.  But I think it did help boost my immune system so it I guess it helped me in another way.</li>
    <li> I love this supplement.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband to try as part of a new supplement regimine for his Reynauld&#x27;s (very bad circulation in his fingers).

I highly recommend &amp; intend to start using it myself for general well-being.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for at least 6 months and can see better results.  yes, i would recommend this.</li>
    <li> this is a great product  however can be pricey sometimes so I watch for it to go down in price</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you</li>
    <li> This is a very good product (and, through amazon.com less expensive than in the Vitamin Shoppe).  I love especially what it does for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this supplement for soft skin. I recommended to my 65+ age mother for her rosacea and she swears by it. The price for the larger bottle here on Amazon is the best anywhere.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and is something I take for our eyes and stomach and all over well being.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality omega 7 oil source at a decent price. The product is very fresh and comes in a large quantity. I would recommend this product for those who wish to add omega 7 supplements to their diet.</li>
    <li> I finished my first bottle of pills and bought a second because I enjoyed the first. I struggle with chronic acne, so I got this product for its anti inflammatory properties. Unfortunately my doctor had me stop taking these for a while since the capsules contain carrageenan, which can apparently cause inflammation, so I have to avoid these for the time being while I bring down the inflammation already present in my body (as a result of food allergies, not these capsules). When I&#x27;m all healed up again I&#x27;ll continue taking these because it&#x27;s a very handy way to get your dose of sea buckthorn oil without the bitter taste of the fruit oil that you can also buy from Sibu. If you like sea buckthorn products but don&#x27;t like the taste of the juice or the fruit oil, I&#x27;d recommend taking these. I have trouble swallowing pills, but these go down easy!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever.  My hair was so thin I was getting bald spots at 45!  I starting taking it at the advice of my hair cutter.  I took two a day for about 3 months.  After about a months I noticed no hair in the sink after 3 months my hair was noticeable thicker and the bald spots were less noticeable.  When on vacation for 3 weeks I forgot to bring it.  Within a week my hair was everywhere and when I returned my bald sports were back.  Can&#x27;t attritubute it to anything else.  It also nice for your nails and skin.</li>
    <li> For years I was taking antacids ever night and had serious acid reflux. My GP told me about studies using Seabuck Oil. After about 2  months I could once again eat spicy foods again and I haven&#x27;t had acid reflux in over a year. I do not even have any antacids in my house. One word of Caution. Never buy online when the outside temperature is going to be hot. One the gel caps will melt and two the oil will become more ransid not dangerous as most US cooking oil is ransid bu the fresher the product the better</li>
    <li> After trying several brands of Seabuckthorn, I have gone back to this one. It has the most consistent moisturizing properties and is easy to swallow. Helps with dry eyes and diminishing the look of fine lines. I just love it and hate to be without.</li>
    <li> I have bought these before in the smaller size, and fancy container. This size is a much better buy for the same product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking lots of different supplements for over 15 years. I saw an improvement in moisture on my skin with one week of use. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the one thing I never forget  to do for health</li>
    <li> Time will tell whether this supplement will add to my over all health.  I have only been taking this suppllment for three months.  However, I must say I can already tell a difference in my hair and nails.  My fingernails used to bend and crack.  Now, they are strong.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Been using for several weeks and, haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.</li>
    <li> The best omega-7 I have ever had. I did try others. This is the best in price and quality.</li>
    <li> It has strenghtened my nails and my hair is shiny, way less hair loss with new growth already - a month tomorrow. I reordered in quantity through Amazon due to great price. My local store, although I am grateful for their initial recommendation, was priced four times higher - a profit is one thing - highway robbery is another.

    <li> This is the least expensive place I have found for this product. I started taking the supplement for skin care but found that my arthritis significantly diminished since I started taking it.</li>
    <li> This is part of my vitamin regime for strong finger nails and healthy hair.  Thank you for offering this product.  Product is shipped quickly and securely.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a really good  product it makes my skin look and feel beautiful along with other Sibu products.it works</li>
    <li> Fantastic product especially if combined with Sibu Serum and Day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rania Hijawi&lt;br /&gt;Kuwait.</li>
    <li> greatest product on the earth and worth trying.  I have used it for years and it is cheaper here.  I love what it does to your hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by Dr.Oz as a good source of an antioxidant. I have faithfully taken it daily for several years and happy to say a side benefit is thick shiny healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Product looks like the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for a couple of years now.I take two every day, I think it helps a lot ,I haven&#x27;t had a bad spell with bronchitis since I started taking these, I feel great all the time and it seems to have helped my immune system. I will always take sea buckthorn oil, and this is a great price and quantity.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for over a year now and my hair has grown like crazy. The breakage/shedding has decreased a LOT!!! I have noticed that if I start/stop a prescription med or start/stop taking a vitamin the shedding will increase slightly until my body adjusts and then it will go back to normal. I used to have two 50 cent piece size balls of hair and they are nickel size now. My nails are also growing. If they break today, within two weeks they are back to the same length. This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve included two pictures. The first one is May 2012 and the second is September 2014 to show the growth of my hair. I am natural if that helps.</li>
