      <li>no matter the amount of lotion i applied nothing change, within 5 days of using this product my cuticles began to look normal again.</li>
      <li>Thirdly, it works wonders for my cuticles; making them look hydrated and photo ready.</li>
      <li>Love that there is a semi flat side to tip the bottle a little.</li>
      <li>bottle is a little bulky to use once you apply oil to first hand.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  My manicurist uses it and I really like it.</li>
    <li> bottle is a little bulky to use once you apply oil to first hand.</li>
    <li> I  wish there was a minus star. The product never worked, but it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t return it within the 30 days. But it was a birthday gift. She received it in March and didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings by telling me it was DOA.</li>
    <li> This cuticle oil is amazing!!  I have this one and the Pomegranate scent and they both smell absolutely divine!!  My cuticles have never been this good, ever!  No more hangnails!!</li>

    <li> Dry cuticles? BUY THIS!!! I have very dry cuticles from washing dishes, washing clothes and washing my hands several times a day in very hot and very cold water and I have tried lotions and other cuticle creams and this is the ONLY thing that has helped. My cuticles aren&#x27;t dry and cracking and they dont bleed or hurt anymore and I only used this one time! It is a bit oily and you have to give it time to soak in and absorb by your skin. So sit in your most comfy clothes, put your feet up, pop in a good movie and sit back and enjoy your new pretty fingers.&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I really didn&#x27;t think it smelled like Milk and Honey I think it&#x27;s more floral than anything, but it&#x27;s very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I absoultely love this product!! I have milk &amp; honey and I also bought the pomegranate &amp; fig both products work wonders on my hands. Due to the harsh soap that my job use my cuticles were so horrible no matter the amount of lotion i applied nothing change, within 5 days of using this product my cuticles began to look normal again. My hands are back to their pre-military state.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast, I am fully satisfied with the cuticle oil and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Cuccio has excellent products, and this one is the best cuticle oil I have found.  Does not leave oily feel on skin.</li>
    <li> Works great on my cuticles</li>
    <li> Love this product and the pleasant fragrac</li>
    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
