      <li>This Tweezerman is the best tool for removing them.  </li>
      <li>thing works great.</li>
      <li>But it works great on toes, so I kept it.  </li>
      <li>These work great.  </li>
      <li>The case is great.  </li>
      <li>, these are just that amazing!)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d still be stinking THRILLED !  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but these are awesome!  </li>
      <li>So I thought this would be perfect - no spring, ergonomic fit, but I don&#x27;t like the way it fits in my hand.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>They are a good investment.</li>
      <li>TO GET A GOOD ANGLE</li>
      <li>It does not do a good job of trimming hangnails.  </li>
      <li>GOOD</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exceptional.</li>
      <li>And the lifetime sharpening that comes with it makes it even better!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>These are still just as amazing as the day I bought them.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Tweezerman Stainless Steel Squeeze and Snip\\&quot; is an excellent product!</li>
      <li>Because I liked the Tweezerman Cuticle Nipper</li>
      <li>The scissor kind</li>
      <li>These look and feel surgical grade, and they come with a nice case that has a magnet snap</li>
      <li>Nice cuticle remover.</li>
      <li>Also like size and case, which will be handy for travel.</li>
      <li>They never dull and always close perfectly!</li>
      <li>I thought with so many good reviews this item would surely be a hit.</li>
      <li>These are used by squeezing them together like a pair of tweezers making them very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It is so much better than the scissor kind</li>
      <li>so sometimes I have to spend more time making my nails look nice because the tweezer clippers haven&#x27;t done their job.  </li>
      <li>A nail professional recommended this item as best for clipping cuticles</li>
      <li>It is more compact than the nipper and comes with a carrying case - handy for those who travel.  </li>
      <li>This product is much more effective.</li>
      <li>Best cuticle remover me used so far.</li>
      <li>I even let my mom use them and she  loved them so much she bought her own pair!</li>
      <li>but I like the regular squeezy kind of cuticle nippers the best.  </li>
      <li>, I am able to get my nails/hands looking pretty good on my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, Tweezerman, I love your products!</li>
      <li>but it is very easy to control  what part to clip off ...  (delightful to use almost daily :)</li>
      <li>My scissor-style cuticle clippers broke after many years of use and I replaced them with these.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I just need more time to adjust, but I won&#x27;t buy them again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I read someone else&#x27;s review for the Tweezerman cuticle scissors, where they recommended these snippers instead.</li>
      <li>but so glad I bought this one.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought it</li>
      <li>Best personal care product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>Comes in a cute case.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re even able to be re-sharpened</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll snip off more than I should.</li>
      <li>but with more bite.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>With these you are able to trim the cuticle closely and neatly.  </li>
      <li>and my husband love it too</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t ever seen a better one.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
      <li>Ok, if you&#x27;re like me you hesitate to purchase this because of the cost.</li>
      <li>My nails,cuticles, and the skin around them look better than they have in ages.</li>
      <li>Not gonna lie, the product itself is great and the case is very convenient...</li>
      <li>But overall, great product!</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t too many brands that can stand up to &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; just my opinion.</li>
      <li>I think the plier like cuticle nippers are much better.</li>
      <li>and it looks and feels better.</li>
      <li>It was very easy and precise to use--even in a moving car.  </li>
      <li>Work pretty good</li>
      <li>Rather than damaging my nail more by pulling the hangnail free, or even trying to bite it off, I have found this tool to be the correct and safest solution.  </li>
      <li>Being a &amp;#34;cuticle picker&amp;#34;, I need to have something handy to &amp;#34;snip&amp;#34; any cuticle and/or skin right away before I start picking.</li>
      <li>These sharp, tweezer like nippers are the very best thing I have found for getting rid of anything I want to pick at.  </li>
      <li>the unique design of these lets you have more control over how you cut.</li>
      <li>The design allows me to use them easily with my non-dominant hand.</li>
      <li>I find it easy to use.</li>
      <li>However, these are easy to use with either hand, since I&#x27;m not ambidextrous this is great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get over the great quality, comes in a nice pink cover to protect your fingers as you look for them in your bag.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We liked the Tweezerman so much that we purchased one for our camper and to go in the car for those moments when a hangnail is \\&quot;driving\\&quot; you nuts!</li>
      <li>Accurate and as easy to use as tweezers</li>
      <li>and I must say; the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Hangnail Trimmer&amp;#34; is one of those items that I&#x27;m so stinking THRILLED with that if I had paid 5 times as much</li>
      <li>Fortunately Amazon carried them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These snippers are fantastic.</li>
      <li>So far, so good...</li>
      <li>Super easy to use and snips cuticles without a problem.</li>
      <li>This snipper does the best job of getting right down to where you need to snip of any implement I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny !  </li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
      <li>These are great for hangnails - super precise, sharp, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I definately should have listened to this one reviewer who said that this item does not leave a clean cut.</li>
      <li>The cuticle pusher at the end of the tweezer-looking device is itself one of the best, most precise tools out there, and the 2-finger cuticle snipper makes sure I don&#x27;t have any more painful bleeding hangnails.</li>
      <li>Well this is the right tool for the job !  </li>
      <li>I ordered these clippers because I can never find good enough cuticle cutters in the store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to the bulky larger cuticle clipper for my manicure, but I suppose this one would be a good item for traveling, or for men, or for anyone who isn&#x27;t trying to give themselves a manicure that looks like you just stepped out of a salon.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a pair that will fit nicely in your travel toiletries bag that you&#x27;ll only use from time to time then I would recommend these.  </li>
      <li>I also have a more standard cuticle clipper and that works better for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my second time to purchase the Tweezerman cuticle snipper.  I lost the first one and had to have another right away.  With the pink case, it&#x27;s a lot easier to find it in my purse.  This snipper does the best job of getting right down to where you need to snip of any implement I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My daughter loves it too, so I purchased one for her Christmas stocking!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. They take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it can&#x27;t be any easier. I have done less picking at my cuticles since i purchased these. I clip them instead. I wash my hands frequently and they stay dry. These have helped me cut down on the hang nails considerably.</li>
    <li> Wanted to order 4 of these. I am ordering for a all of our nail techs.  Disappointed I was limited to 3.</li>
    <li> Because I liked the Tweezerman Cuticle Nipper so well, I thought my husband would like this Cuticle and Hangnail Snipper.  It is more compact than the nipper and comes with a carrying case - handy for those who travel.  As the snipper performs nearly a duplicate function when compared with the nipper and unless one family member travels, I would recommend only purchasing one of the two items - the snipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snipper works extremely well; it is sharp and the tip is easy to place at the base of a hangnail.  The snipping action of this instrument is much easier than the nipper when working in close areas.  I&#x27;m not ambidexterous or particularly coordinated, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble using it on both hands.  So far, so good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the snipper in Amazon&#x27;s picture was shown with a black case which is what I expected to receive.  The listing&#x27;s description had no notation about the case coming in various colors.  Unfortunately, the snipper I received came with a hot pink case - not exactly what my husband will want to carry with him.  Regardless, I&#x27;m keeping this snipper as returning it for another case would have been more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> user male. Nice cuticle remover. So far used it on my hand finger nails. awesome performance. Best cuticle remover me used so far. recommend it 5 out of 5 .got the package on time.</li>
    <li> This thing is so much better than the other kind.  You do have to be super careful since they are so precise and sharp but that&#x27;s what makes them ROCK!!  (I know, calm down...it&#x27;s just a cuticle trimmer).</li>
    <li> I used cuticle clippers, and though I would try these. No comparison. Does a sloppy job, cuts cuticle uneven and hard to get accuracy around the edge of the nail bed. These will have a short life, cause I don&#x27;t like these.</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie, the product itself is great and the case is very convenient... but I took off one star because I expected a pink case and got a black one instead. The description should have been clear. But overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but these are awesome!  They work very well, they get the hangnails so much better than regular clippers.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using them now!</li>
    <li> Ok, if you&#x27;re like me you hesitate to purchase this because of the cost. You wonder how you can justify paying 2/3 of a salon manicure (a rare treat for me) for one item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you think about how many times you will likely use this, comparing it to the cost of a salon visit actually makes a solid case for buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say from experience I have never been disappointed with the quality or functionality of Tweezerman products. They are a good investment. Often the versions of their beauty items which sell for 1/2 the cost just can&#x27;t do the job they claim to do, at all, and so can you really say you saved money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a salon manicure the other day and could not believe how neat and tidy my crummy, peeling fingers looked. I watched him use a cuticle clipper and decided that seeing as how hard it is to get a sitter and money so that I can go to the salon, I should invest in some nail care items for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works great. I find it easy to use. I find it easy to avoid cutting &#x27;live&#x27; skin, as the product instructions above so carefully instruct. :) It&#x27;s addicting, I keep searching for tiny pieces to clip (my fingertips peel alot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am able to get my nails/hands looking pretty good on my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, Tweezerman, I love your products! I am investing in several nail care pieces to put together a kit as a Christmas gift to myself!</li>
    <li> This tweezer was purchased after a month-long search for a nail-clipper style cuticle clipper (LaCross seemes to have ceased selling one... Finally found one at Wegman&#x27;s)... back to Tweezerman.  Tried it on finger cutlicles, and ended up with a few bruises &amp; nicks... it&#x27;s way too sharp and unwieldy - especially if you&#x27;re not ambidextrous - so it&#x27;s hard to get to the target spot without taking off a bit extra (sorry for the graphic violence!).  But it works great on toes, so I kept it.  Leather-like case is critical, if you don&#x27;t want to poke yourself trying to get Tweezerman out of a drawer crevice.  (4 stars for toes, 1 if fingers).</li>
    <li> These are excellent. &lt;br /&gt;I thought all cuticle clippers had to have those bulky handles just because no one was making anything different. &lt;br /&gt;These squeezy type clippers that are a lot like tweezers feel really natural in the hand and they are super sharp and best of all they give total control. &lt;br /&gt;I feel like cuticle maintenance is so easy and fast with these. &lt;br /&gt;They are really small like fat tweezers so they take up no space and are really great for travelling. &lt;br /&gt;Buy them.. they are excellent.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman items are the best!</li>
    <li> I ordered these clippers because I can never find good enough cuticle cutters in the store. They always seem to not be sharp enough but these are so great and easy to use. the unique design of these lets you have more control over how you cut. I even let my mom use them and she  loved them so much she bought her own pair!</li>
    <li> Any tools made by Tweezerman are the best, and this is no exception!! Sharp and highly precise.</li>
    <li> It has become so dull I can&#x27;t use it any longer. For the price I paid, this should not have happened.</li>
    <li> This snipper is high quality, sharp and precise.  It is easily used whether you&#x27;re right handed or left handed.  I live where it&#x27;s very dry resulting in dry skin in all seasons. This little piece of equipment works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I get hangnails pretty much daily, so this tool is indispensable.  And when I push back my cuticles, this does a great job at getting rid of the dead skin that&#x27;s left behind.  It&#x27;s highly ergonomic since it functions like tweezers, but it&#x27;s very sharp (as it should be), so one must be very careful to cut the correct area of skin when using the product.  And the lifetime sharpening that comes with it makes it even better!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cuticle clipper to give you a clean, good looking manicure, this is not a good choice! I don&#x27;t find this item to be very sharp, and it leaves the edges of my cuticle a little ragged.  I&#x27;m going to stick to the bulky larger cuticle clipper for my manicure, but I suppose this one would be a good item for traveling, or for men, or for anyone who isn&#x27;t trying to give themselves a manicure that looks like you just stepped out of a salon.  And it is DEFINITELY not worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best nippers I&#x27;ve bought! They never dull and always close perfectly! The only thing is, you have to be careful when using them because they are a wee bit sharp. You don&#x27;t want to use these in a moving car or on the bus or any other moving vehicle for that matter. You need to sit completely still to use these! But they do get rid off hang nails and that little bit of cuticle that you find yourself fondling with ALL day until you get home or go to the nail salon to have removed!</li>
    <li> My scissor-style cuticle clippers broke after many years of use and I replaced them with these.  While they work I may end up buying another pair of scissor-style clippers.  I feel that these clippers lack precision so sometimes I have to spend more time making my nails look nice because the tweezer clippers haven&#x27;t done their job.  Perhaps I just need more time to adjust, but I won&#x27;t buy them again.  If you&#x27;re looking for a pair that will fit nicely in your travel toiletries bag that you&#x27;ll only use from time to time then I would recommend these.  If you&#x27;re looking for clippers you&#x27;ll use more frequently then I&#x27;d look for another option.</li>
    <li> We liked the Tweezerman so much that we purchased one for our camper and to go in the car for those moments when a hangnail is \\&quot;driving\\&quot; you nuts!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get over the great quality, comes in a nice pink cover to protect your fingers as you look for them in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;It is really sharp, don&#x27;t be mistaken, gets the job done fast and precisely.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
    <li> We were going to out to eat and I noticed I had a \\&quot;snaggly\\&quot; cuticle.  My friend offered her new gadget \\&quot;Tweezerman Cuticle Snip\\&quot; to try.  It was very easy and precise to use--even in a moving car.  It&#x27;s very sharp so one snip and you&#x27;re done!  After dinner, I got online and ordered one for myself.  It comes in its own carrying pouch and even fits in a small purse.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that will actually cut the cuticles not rip them. This does just that!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with anything else.</li>
    <li> These are perfect.  I have a horrible habit of picking at my cuticles.  Any little irregularity in the cuticle starts me picking and pulling at it, which only increases the problem.  These sharp, tweezer like nippers are the very best thing I have found for getting rid of anything I want to pick at.  I maneuver them to get at places where I find other styles awkward.  I highly recommend these if you have similar problems.</li>
    <li> I replaced my 15+ year old Revlon nippers with these, which I purchased at a big-box beauty supply store. I have mild arthritis and at times my hands would hurt after using my old nippers. What an expensive disappointment! These feel large and clumsy....I find it nearly impossible to cleanly trim my cuticles. The thickness of the metal makes it very difficult to get only your cuticle without nipping some skin at the same time. Like another reviewer stated, I&#x27;m not a professional nail artist, but I am more than capable of trimming my cuticles...just not with these.</li>
    <li> I have terrible nails and always needing a clipper.  Standard clipper don&#x27;t work well for me so I always use the cuticle nipper type.  I looked for a clipper that would go on my key ring but so glad I bought this one.  The case is great.  It goes in my pocket in the morning and stays with me all day.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> heavier than expected but it is very easy to control  what part to clip off ...  (delightful to use almost daily :)</li>
    <li> I love this little snip because it addresses those little nubs between the nail and the skin.&lt;br /&gt;One snip and it looks and feels better. I still prefer the rounded scissor type for clipping&lt;br /&gt;the cuticle at the base of the nail. Comes in a cute case.</li>
    <li> These snippers are fantastic. They are high quality and cut cuticles very well. The case is an added bonus as the snippers are very sharp and could easily cut someone by accident. The pink case also makes them easier to find. I would buy these again. They&#x27;re worth the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I tend to over clip my cuticles when I use this device. I also have a more standard cuticle clipper and that works better for me.</li>
    <li> NEEDEDTHIS . THIS WORKS BETTER THAN SMALL SISSORS.  JUST PINCH TOGETHER AND IT CUTS OFF YOUR CUTICLE OR HANG NAIL. GOOD TO GET A GOOD ANGLE ON UNLIKE SISSORS.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of stuff online and from Amazon. I bought the &amp;#34;Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional Nail Nipper, Stainless Steel&amp;#34; as well as other grooming products and I must say; the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Hangnail Trimmer&amp;#34; is one of those items that I&#x27;m so stinking THRILLED with that if I had paid 5 times as much I&#x27;d still be stinking THRILLED !  I use these all the time. I joke with my wife that I need a carrying case with lanyard that I can put around my neck so I can have them with me at all times (no, I&#x27;m not a weirdo, these are just that amazing!) You know those little pieces of skin that stand up around your nails when your hands are dry ? And the hang nail things that are rough and annoying and peel off around the sides of your nails ? Well this is the right tool for the job !  You know how when you have the right tool for the job how the job becomes fun ?  Well this is one of those tools ! Buy it ! Worth every penny !  Update  March 13, 2015  These are still just as amazing as the day I bought them. Still just as sharp and I still love them. Best personal care product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been having dry and peeling cuticles for a few months, and all the men&#x27;s grooming resources I came across didn&#x27;t really help the issue. Vaseline + cuticle pusher wasn&#x27;t really working too well -- nails would look fine, except for a large, pushed up bundle of skin by the base. Ugh.    Bought this, and it&#x27;s one of the easiest grooming products that I&#x27;ve ever come across. The cuticle pusher at the end of the tweezer-looking device is itself one of the best, most precise tools out there, and the 2-finger cuticle snipper makes sure I don&#x27;t have any more painful bleeding hangnails. The tweezer/snipper opening is pretty small, so it&#x27;s easy to manage and avoid over-snipping. I use this about once a week, whenever I trim my nails.</li>
    <li> These are amazingly sharp and the grip makes it very user friendly...makes it easy to use with your non-dominant hand.  I love these so much I&#x27;ve included in a manicure \\&quot;kit\\&quot; as gifts and have always gotten positive feedback.</li>
    <li> Small and handy; perfect for the purse or backpack; not sure how I got along without it before.</li>
    <li> I used to bite and chew my nails bloody - it was really embarrassing. I tried using cuticle creams and pushing my cuticles back, but no dice, it was a very hard habit to break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these little things, I can snip of hangnails rather than pull and tear at them. My cuticles now look like I&#x27;ve never even chewed them. And fiddling with the trimmer even satisfies the same nervous nail-biting urge - though I find I do it substantially less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are incredibly sharp and well aligned, they are always very neat to use. I think using scissor-style trimmers would be more difficult, I found these very easy, just like tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend for nail-biters!</li>
    <li> Perfection.  Super easy to use and snips cuticles without a problem. I haven&#x27;t used it for hangnails but as sharp and ease of use, there would be no problem to get those too.</li>
    <li> Received tweezerman hangnail trimmer recently.  Had an opportunity to use briefly. It is easy to use and exceptionally sharp.  Very happy with the choice I made.  Also like size and case, which will be handy for travel.</li>
    <li> perfect for hangnail trimming. I haven&#x27;t ever seen a better one. High quality steel, cuts clean, no problems. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A handy little tool for hangnails and cuticle trimming. The scissors have remained sharp and it appears to be something that will last for years</li>
    <li> Have used this snipper a number of times.  Works great and is very sharp.  Have to take your time and be careful.  It does just as proposed.</li>
    <li> I like this cuticle nipper but it has a few drawbacks.  One is that it is definitely not for cutting nails.  The second thing I noticed is you have to turn it in impossible directions to get all the fingers done.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not limber enough but I like the regular squeezy kind of cuticle nippers the best.  But these are pretty sharp and good to grab for a quick nip!</li>
    <li> Due to my line of work, my hands do tend to get a little dried out at times, especially during the winter months, and that will sometimes cause a hangnail to appear.  Rather than damaging my nail more by pulling the hangnail free, or even trying to bite it off, I have found this tool to be the correct and safest solution.  These are made of high quality, precision ground stainless steel, and they simply just work.  Tweezerman is my Go-To brand for ANYTHING nail care related.</li>
    <li> I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!! I use it to clip hangnails .It is the best every one should have at least one!</li>
    <li> Quality product! Smooth stainless steel. I know I will get years and years of use our of this product. There aren&#x27;t too many brands that can stand up to &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; just my opinion.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Tweezerman Stainless Steel Squeeze and Snip\\&quot; is an excellent product! It&#x27;s \\&quot;Extremely\\&quot; sharp and easy to use. You can snip jagged cuticles to perfection, allowing for a professional looking manicure. I have tried numerous other types of cuticle trimmers throughout the years and none trim as smoothly as the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Squeeze and Snip. Nothing stays sharp like Tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still own my last pair which I&#x27;ve used for 10 years now and they are nearly as sharp as the new pair. I only bought the 2nd pair because I was concerned I&#x27;d lose the original pair and would be out of luck finding a replacement. I did look for a replacement at various beauty supplies, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Macy&#x27;s, Target, Sephora and Ulta etc. but could not find these Tweezerman snippers anywhere. Fortunately Amazon carried them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product ~ Highly recommended, from years of use.</li>
    <li> I thought with so many good reviews this item would surely be a hit. I thought the people complaining were being nit picky. I definately should have listened to this one reviewer who said that this item does not leave a clean cut. I was left with jagged cuticle edges. I returned it the next business day. I&#x27;m not going to do my nails for it to look worse than when I started. I am not a professional and definately not an amateur in doing my nails. I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> A nail professional recommended this item as best for clipping cuticles but I found it not to be sharp enough so it tears as much as it cuts.</li>
    <li> Work pretty good and my husband love it too, Now I spend less time doing both our nails, Have to buy another one for my chihuahua.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading that this trimmer is more precise and offers more cutting control.  I have been using only this kind of trimmer ever since. It is so much better than the scissor kind and I can easily trim my right hand cuticles with my left hand in a way I never could before with the scissor kind.  The scissor kind I find really hard to use with my non-dominant hand which for me is the left hand. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently removed my acrylic nails and am in the process of caring for my own natural nails.  Being a &amp;#34;cuticle picker&amp;#34;, I need to have something handy to &amp;#34;snip&amp;#34; any cuticle and/or skin right away before I start picking. This is a god sent. I keep it in my purse and whenever I seen any little hangnail building or rough cuticle, I carefully snip it and voila.  Its sharp enough to &amp;#34;snip&amp;#34; dead skin.  Always being careful not to &amp;#34;snip&amp;#34; living skin of course.  So far I&#x27;m very happy with this item and the pink caring case is very cure and practical.</li>
    <li> As a nurse my hands are always dry. No amount of lotion or oil helps. I constantly get small hangnails which develop into nasty, bleeding tears down my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;With these nippers I can quickly and cleanly nip them off when they are tiny. The design allows me to use them easily with my non-dominant hand. Go easy at first until you get the hang of these because they are SHARP! My nails,cuticles, and the skin around them look better than they have in ages. I am going to buy a 2nd pair to keep in my purse. Pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about spending over $25.00 for cuticle trimmers but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  These work great.  With these you are able to trim the cuticle closely and neatly.  These are used by squeezing them together like a pair of tweezers making them very easy to use.  This was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty, razor sharp and very accurate. These look and feel surgical grade, and they come with a nice case that has a magnet snap closure.&lt;br /&gt;My old pair of cuticle trimmers (traditional style) always left a mark on my supporting finger, probably the way I held them (chopstick style). However, these are easy to use with either hand, since I&#x27;m not ambidextrous this is great.&lt;br /&gt;I am a frugal shopper, however, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money for these snippers. I will be using these to manicure my nails for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this hangnail trimmer.  It does not do a good job of trimming hangnails.  There are other products that work better, such as the regular Tweezerman cuticle cutters.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with this. I found it hard to use and always nicking a large horizontal nip into the sides of my fingers. I think the plier like cuticle nippers are much better.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd pair. I dropped the first one and dented the points. Be careful and don&#x27;t drop and they will last a very long time. These are very sharp, so be careful and just trip dead cuticles.</li>
    <li> If youve ever had those pesky little bits of skin that pull up along fingernails and then get yanked off and sting youll love this thing - it cuts them close to the skin so they wont get pulled out by friction. All stainless steel, sharp edges, great buy.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my hang nail came off by itself before I could turn this loose on it.  That said, I got another little piece that was about to turn into a hang nail and nipped it before it could grow.  This baby knocked it off no problem!  Great little gadget.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m not sure if it was intended that way, but I use the end to push my cuticles back. No need for the wooden sticks anymore!</li>
    <li> These squeeze and snip tweezers really shine and live up to their name.  Accurate and as easy to use as tweezers but with more bite.  I have also added this to my emergency first aid kit.</li>
    <li> It comes down to personal preference. I had a cheap traditional style cuticle nipper that the spring kept thwacking me on the knuckle. Really annoying. So I thought this would be perfect - no spring, ergonomic fit, but I don&#x27;t like the way it fits in my hand. It&#x27;s plenty sharp, but I have this fear that its too easy to get carried away or careless and I&#x27;ll snip off more than I should. So I&#x27;ll have to purchase another (better quality) traditional style cuticle nipper and put this one in the spare bathroom for emergency/guest use.</li>
    <li> I have cuticles like horse&#x27;s hooves.  This Tweezerman is the best tool for removing them.  My cuticles don&#x27;t &#x27;push back&#x27;, I have to cut them. Before I found this cutter, I used the ones with handles.  Using this tool, it is much easier to see what you are doing and makes cutting much more precise, no more bloody fingers.  The sharpness lasts a long time. Then you can send it back to Tweezerman to be sharpened for free.  I have bought several pairs and when at last they get dull, I&#x27;ll send in several to be sharpened; save on shipping that way.</li>
    <li> Love this little tool. Does what it&#x27;s intended to do and very well at that. It&#x27;s exceptional. Glad I bought it</li>
    <li> Amazing for cuticles and other trimmings, not to be confused with tweezers! Super sharp and high quality. Great clipper and case!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read someone else&#x27;s review for the Tweezerman cuticle scissors, where they recommended these snippers instead. These are great for hangnails - super precise, sharp, and easy to use. But when I say they are sharp, I mean it. Don&#x27;t go too close to your &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; skin or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself.</li>
    <li> In the past I have used Revlon cuticle nippers. This product is much more effective. The blades are really sharp! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best cuticle cutters I have ever purchased. I have advertised so well 2 of my friends now have the same pair. Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re even able to be re-sharpened but I haven&#x27;t had to in the last couple years.</li>
    <li> I received the product recently and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I tend to have a lot of hangnails and am prone to bite them if I don&#x27;t have an appropriate tool with which to trim them - which leaves my fingers a mess. Now I just whip out my handy, sharp hangnail trimmers and nip the offending hangnail away. What a great tool!</li>
