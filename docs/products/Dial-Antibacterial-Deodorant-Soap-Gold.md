      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I had been using a Dial soap strictly for men, but paying a lot more.</li>

      <li>Keeps the body clean.</li>
      <li>The Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value.</li>

      <li>Yes, this soap does have a strong smell, but we really like how well it cleans.  </li>
      <li>but they dissolve very quickly in the shower, I bought 30 bars and after this I am going back to Dove bars even though more</li>
      <li>Just to add fluff, it smells good too.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of soap I buy</li>
      <li>Dial Soap is my favorite soap so purchasing this was a natural.</li>

      <li>When I was putting away some of these new bars, they felt heavier than the ones I had bought at the store, so I got out my very accurate digital kitchen scale.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dial Soap is my favorite soap so purchasing this was a natural. It arrived on time and in good condition. I probably have enough to last a year!</li>
    <li> after a couple showers the bars show &amp;#34;striations&amp;#34; and layers the water has penetrated. Bars are much &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; than the store versions.</li>
    <li> What can I say??....It&#x27;s soap and the price is good. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who wanted to buy soap in quantity.  Cheaper than the grocery store.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to. Leaves my skin a bit dry but it&#x27;s no big deal for me.</li>
    <li> This is Dial, what is there to complain about.  Great product, great price.  I don&#x27;t use any other bar soap.</li>
    <li> Smooth, and silky soap.  It is much better than Irish Spring....  and the effect is less astringent... Of all the soaps I have used....this is best.</li>
    <li> This soap is o.k. - until you get down toward the end of the bar, at which point it becomes extremely brittle and breaks into pieces.  It is also impossible to make the end of a bar bind to an new bar, so there&#x27;s nothing to do but throw that last bit of soap away.  It makes a mess of soap splinters in the shower and wastes soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Compare this to other brands that hold their integrity even as the bar becomes small and are capable of binding to a new bar.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only soap we use</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 10 years and love it. Every few years I will stray and try a new brand but I always come back to Dial Gold.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product and the best price online.  I am truly pleased with this product and will of course buy again!</li>
    <li> The soap was a good deal.  I now have enough soap to last a really long time. And Dial soap is good because it is anti bacterial</li>
    <li> I had a serious accident and was in the hospital for months. This is what they used and I have done the same ever since.</li>
    <li> Dial Gold has been my favorite for years. The price is right and the free shipping when buying enough items sweetens the deal. Also kudos to the shipper for sealing the purchase in plastic because the day it was delivered and left at the door it was raining. The box was destroyed by the rain, but the soap was safe and sound.</li>
    <li> Great price for the soap.  This has been the go to soap for a while.  Buy through here for the cost savings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dial soap in my household all of my life. Product was shipped as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;When I try another brand of bath soap, I am always disappointed.  I prefer the gold over other varieties.</li>
    <li> Great soap for the price. I had been using a Dial soap strictly for men, but paying a lot more. When I read the reviews on this Gold soap, I just had to order it. I am certainly not disappointed! I love it &amp; it&#x27;s ever bit as good as what I was using for twice as much.</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap. It is perfect for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin like other bars of soap. It is the only soap my husband will use anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!!&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Feels good, cleans good, smells good w/o strong perfume smell &amp; the ONLY antibacterial soap that I can tell is antibacterial. (This &amp; Dove *&lt;--at times* are the only reg bar soaps that I would put on my face, but Dial is great for Acne too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Not quite the same: smaller &amp; melts quick</li>
    <li> Perfect size that stops me from having to run to the store and with gas prices so high, I let them deliver to my door.  I have the storage area and will continue to let them use their gas.</li>
    <li> A great soap with a classic scent!!!</li>
    <li> A good price for this quantity, and I am a long-time user of Dial Gold soap, so I already like the quality. What I especially liked when I got this? Each bar really is 4 ounces. I had some other Dial Gold soap, looked like the same packaging, but I probably bought them at a local store. When I was putting away some of these new bars, they felt heavier than the ones I had bought at the store, so I got out my very accurate digital kitchen scale. And sure enough--the other bars I had bought at the store were 3.75oz, but these new ones are a true 4oz. No wonder the other bars were not lasting as long in the shower!</li>
    <li> This is so far the best antibacterial bar soap I have used. It cleans very well and the smell is relatively neutral/natural—not a whole lot of fragrance in  the same way that you find with other brands. For those two reasons, 5 out of 5!</li>
    <li> working great i love it. usually my skin is very sensitive but its working great with this product. glad i bought.</li>
    <li> Do you stink? I do, if I don&#x27;t use Dial. I recommend this to all my friends who stink, and it really helps. We&#x27;ve tried to switch, and then we stink. This is basically the perfect soap for your various pits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this soap off and on since 1950, made by Armours in the Chicago Stock Yards.  It lasts longer than other bar soaps.  It has a trace of some anti-bacterial chemical, going on 65 years that they are just beginning to wonder about.  The thing I really like about Dial is it seems to me to be harder than other hand soaps and it seems to last much longer in the bath or kitchen - 2 real plusses.  I used to use it with Lifebuoy, now I have an alternate soap when I want to smell.</li>
    <li> Have been using this soap years. To date have not found anything better. Just to add fluff, it smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of soap I buy</li>
    <li> This is the only soap we can use. Others either dry our skin or give us a rash. Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I ordered a few sets of these to include in care packages for the homeless.&lt;br /&gt;Small bars fit great in the packages.</li>
    <li> I get bacterial infections on my skin and this soap makes them go away. I use it on a regular basis and it has not dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> This is the bar soap we use most in our house, though I prefer spring water over gold. Dial gets us clean, and I like that it&#x27;s antibacterial.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Dial...what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> I am reviewing the product. In am just bummed that Amazonkeepsake bumping up the price.This soap is anti bacterial and deodorizes your whole body. I work in a kitchen for 12 hrs and I still smell great. I take off my shoes and no oor would know it was a long day. It doesn&#x27;t dry out like ivory or give me any problems in the areas.  It could last longer but I just take it out of the shower to solve that problem. Affordable and great value.</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap. It&#x27;s great for people with very dry skin or sensitive skin. I find it better than Dove. I got it during a sale so no complaints. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dial since I was a VERY young kid. It smells great and kills odor.  This is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> The dear hate it, so I hang it outside on my bushes andtrees</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> We only use this bath soap. Smells good without being too perfume. Keeps body order away all day.</li>
    <li> An excellent deal for the best antibacterial soap I have ever used, stock up! I like to buy this item in bulk.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Service</li>
    <li> Keeps the body clean.</li>
    <li> Two great things came out of my experience with dial! The body acne has GREATLY REDUCED, making my shower sessions shorter. It gives me that balance. I have had eczema my whole life but only the type where my skin gets dry super easily and is very very sensitive. And for those of you who say this irritates your skin and is super drying to you, you may want to see a derma. However even tho my skin is sensitive I lead an extremely active lifestyle using my legs feet and metro as my means of transportation from point a to b. that means in the summer I sweat ALOT! A lot of what had to do with the body acne was mainly clogged pores and stopped up sweat and bacteria trapped underneath all my clothes on top of the dirt and humidity in the air. Dial washes that all away and then some. So I would highly recommend this soap to anyone who is athletic. I could literally see the dirt rinse off me all the way down the drain it was oddly refreshing.</li>
    <li> Yes, this soap does have a strong smell, but we really like how well it cleans.  We have tried other brands and they are not able to clean as well.</li>
    <li> ITEMS WERE RECIEVED ON TIME--ITEMS WERE EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED--NO PROBLEMS --WILL ORDER AGAIN WHEN NEEDED</li>
    <li> When I ordered these the first time the value was fantastic however I have been unable to get them at that price again on Amazon</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! It smells good, and it&#x27;s great if you have a dirty job and want to feel clean after work, or just super clean in general. I used this a lot while in nursing school and also on my uniforms and shoes. I was so happy to find it in a bulk pack since local stores don&#x27;t carry the liquid bottles anymore.</li>
    <li> Have been using Dial Gold Soap Bar for 2 years. Really like it. It is the best soap for me.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good buy.  I like Dial Gold bars, and took the opportunity to buy in bulk.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for the money. Each case hat 10 soap, so u get a total of 30</li>
    <li> Ever since Lever 2000 removed their antibacterial ingredients, I have been a big fan of Dial. In fact, Dial was recommended to me by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spent 2 weeks on a hiking trip and Dial was a critical part of my gear. Besides showering with it, Dial was great for washing dirty, smelly socks, underwear and shirts. I tried a couple of other soaps at first and found they were miserable failures at cleaning clothes. I gave Dial a try and was an instant convert. Even after multiple days of all-day sweating, clothes hand washed in Dial smelled clean.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap my husband will use.  He has been using it for over 35 years!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I&#x27;m able to share with others who can not afford taxable items. Great price! Shipped and Package with TLC. It&#x27;s the only Body Soap we have ever used and for the others I buy for.</li>
    <li> The title almost sounds like some creative writing course topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I like this soap and have bought this and the spring water version of it for several years now with no problems. The only complaints if anything may be from my boys for whom soap, bathing general cleanliness are enemies not to be trifled with. Someday soon (maybe around puberty) they will sign a peace deal. ;)</li>
    <li> I am a long-time Dial user.  This is simply the best antibacterial bar soap out there.  It doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, not does it leave a film. I&#x27;ve tried other soaps, and even different Dial bar soaps.  The Gold is the best.</li>
    <li> This is the only type of soap we use at our house because we&#x27;ve noticed that other soaps cause us to break out. I was sick of trekking to the store all the time to buy them, so I got them in bulk from Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save... which is amazing because it&#x27;s cheaper than we could find in stores AND they just magically appear on our doorstep every few months. No more using the little nubs of soap that fell on the tub floor until I get to the store to buy more soap!!</li>
    <li> This is always a good buy.I have been buying these dial bar soaps from amazon and they have been very consistent with the quality,value and packaging.So yes, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good deal.</li>
    <li> You need soap. You want to be clean right? This soap works at it should. It suds up nicely in the shower. Go get some soap.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T TOUCH THAT DIAL!  (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dial (owned by Henkel, Germany) recently added a new scooped out bottom shape to their bath size bars, which reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. It was formerly nearly flat on bottom. There is no reason for this scoop except to reduce longevity of the bar while appearing to be the same size as before. Problem is the scoop causes a HAZARD. The bars now WILL NOT STAY IN THE SOAP DISH.  The bars continually fall under foot. I picked up the bar 2 or 3 times every shower. It gets under my feet. I am seriously worried about a SLIP AND FALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deciding to cheat us by cutting a large chunk out of the bar is one thing, but to create also create safety hazard that could really hurt someone is beyond stupid. I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM.  The bar is out of balance on soap dishes. If you have that smaller piece left over from before, you&#x27;ll never get the bar to stay put. It is under foot every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIAL&#x27;S GREED MODIFICATIONS ARE GOING TO HURT SOMEONE!!!!!!  I have about slipped several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so amazed that the current keepers of a formerly great brand could be so recklesss in their quest to cheat us that have tainted a 30 year great brand. The Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value. You added DANGEROUS to their list of product enhancements.  Good job Dial Brand management!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t touch that dial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dial Gold since I was 12. Not sure when it became anti-bacterial, but alli can say is I love this soap. When I am not using Dial Wash, this is what I use on a daily basis. It has a very neutral fresh scent that makes it appealing to everyone in the house, cleanses well, has a nice lather, and doesn&#x27;t leave the tub coated with greasy build up. Two thumbs up for Dial Gold.</li>
    <li> Great savings on 30 freakin&#x27; bars of great antibacterial soap! Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using dial gold for a long time. Other members of my family let me know I better have gold in the cabinet. Not only do I feel clean, but I also get compliments when I get a casual hug.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use.  Was recommended to me when I was in the Navy.  Have used it for over 55 years and have no intention of changing.  It does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of this soap. Such a bargain!</li>
    <li> I have been looking allover for bath size bars of soap. I guess hand bars are the only option available these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to me that the soap industry has also fallen to corporate greed. The pars are shaped and look quite scrawny. They do nor last very long in the shower. Whatever happened to real bars of soap? I feel that Dial once made a good product but has lost their way.</li>
    <li> great deal price wise but they dissolve very quickly in the shower, I bought 30 bars and after this I am going back to Dove bars even though more</li>
    <li> my wife wanted anti-bacterial soap. i have a bunch of bars now so there is no excuse for being unclean</li>
    <li> So easy to have delivered to home. Prime pantry is great.</li>
    <li> Best product for handwashing.</li>
    <li> I use this item daily. Never any problems.</li>
    <li> As represented. Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> same as in the store -now I won&#x27;t have to shop for soap for several months- the scent is mild and pleasant</li>
    <li> It is very good and it has a reasonable price. I check the price even at CVS and it is much cheaper. It has a good smell too.</li>
    <li> love the soap -- hate the new shape -- why does some dweeb in the marketing dept think changing the shape of the soap makes it better...  so these bars are sorta dogbone shaped, with 2 big knobs on the ends and then curved in an arch..  so these is not flat side to the bar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this goofy shape makes the soap constantly slide off the little shelf in the shower.. I even have the little pointy soap savers under them and they constantly leap off the shelf every time i put it down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goofy knobs on bottom, arch shape and flat sides..  I have huge hands (glove size extra large) - and i can NOT hold these bars - i have stopped using them due to these goofy shape</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Gold Dial forever; it&#x27;s that shower time classic I can&#x27;t do without! A memorable scent, an iconic color, and the fact it doesn&#x27;t generate a lot of suds or scum all make it a major winner.</li>
    <li> Clean as whistle and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Super Fast Shipping!! Great product!</li>
