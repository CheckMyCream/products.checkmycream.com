    <li> Very handy to put all my stuffs inside my purse.</li>
    <li> It is colorful and has lots of pockets. Be careful not to overstuff the sides. Will use it to organize purse and bottom of backpack. I had seen this sold by others at three times this price.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for the ladies sac bag without any pockets.</li>
    <li> I got a purse that was just one great big pocket.  I love this thing.  It fits perfect and has tons of pockets.  They have colors that would go with just about any purse.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it&#x27;s holding up really well.</li>
    <li> I ordered two and I&#x27;m glad I did for organizing my travel cosmetics and toiletries. Really pretty item, roomy and well made.</li>
    <li> I really love this!  I ended up having to change purses and not using it yet for that, but setting it up as desk/bedside organizer</li>
    <li> This bag insert is great. It&#x27;s the right size for a beach bag or a larger purse. It has a lot of pockets, some zippered - to keep things separated. There are two small handles that make it easy to carry it and slip in &amp; out of your larger bag. Great for makeup &amp; packing in a suitcase. I really like this bag. It&#x27;s good for diapers &amp; wipes, makeup, toiletries &amp; many things. Great for kids to hold small toys in the car.</li>
    <li> I love it, make my purse change to easy</li>

    <li> Too small, even for a medium sized bag.  The organizer tips over easily, making the contents even HARDER to find.  I stopped using it after only a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This has been very useful. It is well made and has plenty of storage areas. I may have to get one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> my wife travels a lot for work so she bought this to be more organized. she doesnt use a lot of makeup but still does want to be able to carry everything she might need. this bag fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very cute me and my mom both got one in different colors it fits in most medium sized purses.

In case you where interested the dimensions are about 12 inches long and 7 inches high.</li>
