      <li>Love, love this Earthpaste.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>Been using for about a year and my teeth love.</li>
      <li>Still have to give it some more time and thought.</li>
      <li>It also leaves my teeth VERY clean</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t whiten, but you can use a peroxide and baking soda mixture along with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - great toothpaste if you are in the market for natural and organic toothapste!</li>
      <li>My teeth are squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>We love Earth Paste and were pleased to get it at such a good price.</li>
      <li>Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used and makes teeth feel super clean and white.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh taste and it leaves my teeth felling squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>It makes my teeth feel clean</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, love that I can buy three at a time</li>
      <li>Our whole family loves this, the kids too (ages 7-34).&lt;br /&gt;I explained the color and that it was better for them, they all tried it, and prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this a while ago and the toothpaste is okay if you are using some kind of mouthwash or rinse afterwards that will get rid of the dry feeling it leaves.</li>
      <li>My mouth always feels squeaky clean after use and I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m updating my original positive review:  </li>
      <li>I liked using this toothpaste but a year later I&#x27;m having a lot of cavities and gum recession.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;For more on how additives and such in toothpaste affect health, and how to easily adopt a natural lifestyle, check out my book, [[ASIN:B00ODSGWPW</li>
      <li>Safe enough to swallow.</li>
      <li>One of the hardest things for me personally in going Paleo, is finding a good whitening, freshening toothpaste (I have an obsession with white teeth!)</li>
      <li>While this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t particularly whiten your teeth, it is definitely the most \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>The only cons for me are that it falls off the toothbrush easily and sometimes the tube has a air bubble in it and splatters all over, when squeezing toothpaste onto your brush.</li>
      <li>It has a very neutral, no foam taste.</li>
      <li>Now after going to the dentist a year later, he was surprised to see more than 10 cavities with gum recession.  </li>
      <li>I attribute some blame to the very soft tooth brush but some certainly goes to this tooth paste also.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth, or had I should say, until I started using this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>The texture was unexpected- not stringy like most other toothpastes, and it&#x27;s clay colored-but</li>
      <li>Better than other natural toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I have looked all over for natural and organic toothpaste and this is the tops!</li>
      <li>All natural, no preservatives!</li>
      <li>natural toothpaste.</li>
      <li>so I jumped aboard and bought the tapered soft tooth brushes and also found Earth Paste.  </li>
      <li>really a non-issues beyond the initial &amp;#34;that&#x27;s weird.&amp;#34; The kids nicknamed it &amp;#34;dirtpaste&amp;#34;and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. Fast shipping, love that I can buy three at a time so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year. I&#x27;ve found it to be refreshing and it does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste since January...Love it...I tried using regular toothpaste after using this,,,burned my whoe mouth inside...no more Flouride for me</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, exactly what I was looking for.  No chemicals or poisons, and the fluoride stains are going away...</li>
    <li> Earthpaste is fine--received on time, and just as ordered. Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My teeth are squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> Our whole family loves this, the kids too (ages 7-34).&lt;br /&gt;I explained the color and that it was better for them, they all tried it, and prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commercial is hilarious:&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/GRH8cGWtdpE</li>
    <li> Awesome, exactly what I wanted... I loved them! Got my parents and brother hooked on it too!</li>
    <li> Been using for about a year and my teeth love. Reccomended!</li>
    <li> I have many allergies and the over the counter toothpastes also activate a really bad gag reflex. I know a lot of people will look at it and think &amp;#34;mud? eww!&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s not what you think! It has a very neutral, no foam taste. Slight hint of peppermint and it is safe for kids. I have looked all over for natural and organic toothpaste and this is the tops! No xylitol or sugar and it feels like it is remineralizing my teeth! I have very sensitive teeth, or had I should say, until I started using this toothpaste! The sensitivity has gone away! It doesn&#x27;t whiten, but you can use a peroxide and baking soda mixture along with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - great toothpaste if you are in the market for natural and organic toothapste!</li>
    <li> We love Earth Paste and were pleased to get it at such a good price. Great seller!  Packaged well and sent promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Good natural toothpaste. No foaming agents. Not fluoride. Safe enough to swallow. My husband and I like this peppermint. My kids like the lemon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating my original positive review:  I liked using this toothpaste but a year later I&#x27;m having a lot of cavities and gum recession.  I&#x27;ve never had a lot of cavities at one time but a year ago I read about the Bass Method of brushing so I jumped aboard and bought the tapered soft tooth brushes and also found Earth Paste.  My wife wouldn&#x27;t use it but I liked it.  Now after going to the dentist a year later, he was surprised to see more than 10 cavities with gum recession.  I attribute some blame to the very soft tooth brush but some certainly goes to this tooth paste also.  I&#x27;m back to Colgate Total and using a Sonicare electric tooth brush and my dentist&#x27;s reports are very good for the look of my gums and teeth again.  I&#x27;ve always been diligent  with my dental hygiene and now I&#x27;m back in the fold with regard to the support products.</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. My mouth always feels squeaky clean after use and I love that it&#x27;s natural. I&#x27;m in love. Will never use another toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and the toothpaste is okay if you are using some kind of mouthwash or rinse afterwards that will get rid of the dry feeling it leaves. I also found at times that some of the toothpaste literally just sticks to my teeth and gums and I find it when spitting in the sink later on in the day.</li>
    <li> Love, love this Earthpaste. All natural, no preservatives! Don&#x27;t let the color put you off!</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste...taste great and it&#x27;s good for you. A win win for the family</li>
    <li> Better than other natural toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried. The taste is pleasant, and after use, my mouth feels clean.
