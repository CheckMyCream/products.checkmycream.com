    <li> I am use everyday  I did reconnect to most my friend most for the summer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cera Ve am for years and only tried this because my friend swore by it  I&#x27;m a huge fan of Neutrogena products but my regular lotion is loaded with great for my skin nutrients and the Healthy Defense is not  Other than the SPF 50 I didn&#x27;t see any ingredient in the product that is beneficial to my skin  The lesson I learned here is to stick with what works and for me this product is not it</li>
    <li> I hate giving this 4 stars.  It is the BEST moisturizer and sunscreen I have ever seen and used.  No smell.  No irritation.  No clown face.&lt;br /&gt;But .... the sellers have shipped it to me with an expiration date of May 2015 - two weeks away.</li>
    <li> Great SPF sun protection while moisturizing your skin.</li>
    <li> This item has an expiration date of next month. So don&#x27;t buy it unless you can finish it in a month.</li>
    <li> Good product at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and it is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very light and non-greasy. Perfect product for moisterizing and protecting the skin!</li>
    <li> 3rd order for me. Excellent product.  Use it&lt;br /&gt;exculusively!!!</li>
    <li> It left some white residue, like all non-chemical sunscreens.</li>
    <li> most creams leave my face white...this one is great</li>
    <li> IT HAS SUNSCREEN IN IT AND I ALREADY LOVE NEUTROGENA ! WONDERFUL IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PACK LIGHTER FOR A VACATION</li>
    <li> Love it.  A great moisturizing and sunscreen product.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is so important. I Been using this on my skin before I apply my makeup. It is a nice consistency and not too heavy on the skin.</li>
    <li> The product expires within one month of receipt of the product.</li>
    <li> Havent used. The ingredients mention three healthy things and one of those healthy things. But the rest of the ingredients are all man made chemicals so I will not be using this. I feel like they falsely advertised and omited information.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy their products and will not use them even if someone gave me the product for free</li>
    <li> It makes my face looks white</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by my dermatologist for dry skin problems on my face. I begin using it faithfully before retiring for the evening and have noticed a clearer facial appearance. It also has a 50 spf uv filter rating.</li>
    <li> Product expires in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I did receive mine coupleof days back. Only thing I gave 1 star was, the product expires next month.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for sensitive or dry skin.  My Dermatologist has recommended Neutrogena products and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.  It contains sunscreen, has a very mild scent and is non-irritating.  After an allergic reaction that caused my skin to peel this was the only product that I was able to use. I&#x27;ve tried other products since then but always come back to Neutrogena because of the benefits and cost.</li>
    <li> I got my product in a timely matter and it was a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the moisturizer however makes my skin very dry :(</li>
    <li> Not really a moisturizer.  A daily sunblock with some moisturizing effects.  Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was.  However, as a daily facial sunblock I like it.</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena products; this one has worked great for my sensitive skin as a daily facial moisturizer/sun screen. Not greasy or oily; goes on and rubs in easily… smooth and creamy texture.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, this product does keep me from getting sunburned and does not irritate my skin.</li>

    <li> Disappointed that this product expires soon.</li>
    <li> I have skin cancer issues and have used this product for several years as my morning moisturizer.  Make up is easily applied over it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and really does moisturize my skin.  It&#x27;s the only product I will use.  This price was much better than retail stores, too.</li>
    <li> I love it because I really don&#x27;t have a choice, due to my skin condition....Doctor&#x27;s orders! Unfortunately, Nutrogena refuses to make this product in a large size... For the love of God, why not? So this seller had the regular small sizes for a great price and I bought 3! Great price and prompt service, what more can you ask for???</li>
