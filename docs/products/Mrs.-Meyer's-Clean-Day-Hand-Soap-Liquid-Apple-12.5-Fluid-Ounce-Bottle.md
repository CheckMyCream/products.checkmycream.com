      <li>Smells wonderful and simple ingredients.</li>
      <li>what more could I ask?</li>
      <li>This is my favorite Meyer&#x27;s soap.  </li>
      <li>I wish the soap had a better lather to it</li>
      <li>This soap smells great (fresh and like the real thing!)</li>
      <li>Always good to only use the kind you love.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy this soap as it doesn&#x27;t have a boat load of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Fantastic hand soap that has a light fragrance of apple.</li>
      <li>Nice aroma &amp; very comparable to the Bath &amp; Body works products.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hand soap!</li>
      <li>I feel good about using this regularly on my hands.  </li>
      <li>Too sickly sweet, too overpowering an aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Radish</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful crisp apple scent, and the soap does not leave your hands feeling dry, and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Mild and herby.</li>
      <li>not as strongly scented as some mrs meyers products, but works very well.</li>
      <li>Love it, but makes me wonder if such a strong aroma can be derived without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Honeysuckle</li>
      <li>every time I wash my hands I smile.</li>
      <li>This soap is gentle on the skin and has a clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Priced about the same as the grocery store -- maybe a little better -- but shows up on the front porch.&lt;br /&gt;Apple is a good choice too.</li>
      <li>, it smells exactly like you would imagine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an avid user of Meyers products.</li>
      <li>I really like this line of natural cleaning products, but some of them can smell quite... unique...</li>
      <li>Just love the scent of this hand soap, and my hands never feel dry after using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve previously used the Honest brand foaming hand soap and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but found them too watery.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the other scents from Mrs. Meyers and this is definitely my favorite.  </li>
      <li>works in terms of high quality (not chemical-smelling) aroma, and the strength of the aroma.</li>
      <li>I actually prefer this type since it has less fragrance aroma, more natural.</li>
      <li>The scents are fantastic (I have honeysuckle and green apple)</li>

<li> A classic, can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
<li> The apple scent is too strong and smells very artificial.</li>
<li> It smells just as they describe it, with a little &amp;#34;tartness&amp;#34; to it, if you can believe that.</li>
<li> I wanted a hand soap that wasn&#x27;t antibacterial and didn&#x27;t contain a bunch of harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> The scent is hard to find at big box stores and is expensive at specialty grocery stores.</li>
<li> I recently switched from using Bath and Body Works soaps (really bad for your skin) to these</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve become rather obsessed with the Mrs. Meyers products, and so I tried the Apple hand soap to put at my kitchen sink.</li>
<li> : Hated it.</li>

    <li> The Apple scent is amazing! I really like this line of natural cleaning products, but some of them can smell quite... unique...

    <li> Love the scent and the products! I can&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become rather obsessed with the Mrs. Meyers products, and so I tried the Apple hand soap to put at my kitchen sink. It did not disappoint! It smells just as they describe it, with a little &amp;#34;tartness&amp;#34; to it, if you can believe that. I may end up switching to the foam soap to make it last longer, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Washing my hands with apple scent helps me to feel refreshed when I am tired and ready to take a nap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of Meyers products. This 3 pack of their Apple soap was such a great price! Great quality product!</li>

I&#x27;ve previously used the Honest brand foaming hand soap and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but found them too watery. I went to EWG.org and browsed the hand soaps with an A rating and found Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s. The scents are fantastic (I have honeysuckle and green apple) and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>

    <li> Love the brand and the scent is great! All the scents of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Liquid Hand Soaps are great. None are too over powering! Can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Meyer&#x27;s soap.  The smell is spot on and makes you feel refreshed after each hand wash.</li>
    <li> Great product, fair price, made in usa, prompt service - what more could I ask?</li>
    <li> This review describes my opinion on the various lines of Mrs. Meyers hand soap that I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basil: Mild and herby. Although a bit boring, the earthy smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and has the potential to be a staple.&lt;br /&gt;Apple: Smells like freshly cut apples... delicious! Matches my previous favorites from Bath and body works in terms of high quality (not chemical-smelling) aroma, and the strength of the aroma. Love it, but makes me wonder if such a strong aroma can be derived without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Honeysuckle: Hated it. Too sickly sweet, too overpowering an aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Radish: Found this at Marshall&#x27;s, I actually like it! It is closer to basil in strength of aroma and earthiness, and makes the perfect kitchen hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Verbena: A classic, can&#x27;t go wrong with it. It does end up smelling a bit like the rest of the handsoaps, though.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and simple ingredients. I recently switched from using Bath and Body Works soaps (really bad for your skin) to these and wow what a difference my hands are less dry and cracked and the cost is the same. Love them</li>
    <li> not as strongly scented as some mrs meyers products, but works very well.</li>
    <li> The apple scent is too strong and smells very artificial.</li>
    <li> Move Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s hand soaps. Apple and Honeysuckle are my two favorite scents. This stuff isn&#x27;t overly drying, but if you&#x27;re anti-bac inclined, then obviously this one isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Nice clean, fragrant apple scent that leaves a pleasant smell on your hands.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hand soap that has a light fragrance of apple.</li>
    <li> I was an *ole bar soap girl* until fell in love with Mrs. Meyers hand soap while visiting my daughter in North Dakota and to my surprise she sent me this 3 pack as a gift.  Apple scented.. I&#x27;ve tried several liquid soaps in the past and was NOT a fan but this brand really nice. I also tried the lavender all purpose cleaner at my daughters too and really loved it...so Dear Daughter if you&#x27;re reading this....HINT HINT :-)</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used the product prior to this purchase.  It&#x27;s a very good product though a bit on the pricey side</li>
    <li> Nice size, smells nice. I wish the soap had a better lather to it, I feel like I have to use a lot of this soap each time I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> every time I wash my hands I smile. Always good to only use the kind you love. Also, all visiting kids love to wash their hands. Go for it.</li>
    <li> I never see the apple scented soap in stores, but I am glad I discovered it on Amazon! It has a wonderful crisp apple scent, and the soap does not leave your hands feeling dry, and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> Yikes, seems like Meyer&#x27;s missed the mark on this scent.  I like there other hand soaps (basil is my fav) but don&#x27;t care for this one.</li>
    <li> This soap smells like bona fide apples! Wonderful scent and it feels great on the hands! Really enjoy this soap as it doesn&#x27;t have a boat load of chemicals. Highly recommended!</li>
