      <li>my 87 year old mother, with all her teeth, absolutely loved these!!!!</li>
      <li>Brushes are pretty great, I use a home made powder toothpaste and I love that this brush has not turned colors yet</li>

      <li>This is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but I want them to be 100% biodegradable boxes, or not even have them at all.</li>
      <li>Made wonderfully and really last!!</li>
      <li>Lol My mouth felt very clean afterwards as well and feels natural in my hand.</li>
      <li>The bristles are way too soft to do any good cleaning.</li>
      <li>My 5-year-old nephew was thrilled to receive one because it fit his mouth better than standard toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The wide brush handle gives a good grip, yet, very light weight.</li>
      <li>You should absolutely give this toothbrush a try. :)</li>
      <li>Boxes only make things look more appealing for 3 seconds, and then they are not even used anymore.</li>
      <li>This was our first time trying bamboo toothbrushes, and the whole family is enjoying them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for more natural products to use in my everyday life and this Bamboo Toothbrush seemed like the perfect fit to replace my old plastic ones.</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t think that I was going to get such a nice toothbrushing out of it since the toothbrush looks kind of simple, but it did scrub my teeth well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are just right.  </li>
      <li>More stiff than most mediums, while still being just as bending/giving.</li>
      <li>Very good toothbrush - small - soft but durable.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to give this a try until the first time I brushed my teeth with it--YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE YOUR FINGER!</li>
      <li>Goes very well with my decor.</li>
      <li>We purchased these toothbrushes a couple of weeks and really like them.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good delicate, soft, and cleans really really well because of the slim size</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>My 6 year old loves hers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I do appreciate the natural materials.</li>
      <li>I like how lightweight they are and that they are made of natural products.</li>
      <li>But, it irrites me when companies who believe in using all natural products, conform to using plastic windows on their boxes.</li>
      <li>I like the experience of the natural bamboo in my mouth rather than man-made plastic and the rubbery stuff that makes up the ususal toothbrush handles.</li>
      <li>even though these toothbrushes are all natural, the packaging still has a plastic window.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super hard to live without plastic; I get it.</li>
      <li>But I was great disappointed.</li>

    <li> This was our first time trying bamboo toothbrushes, and the whole family is enjoying them.</li>
    <li> These natural bristle toothbrushes made out of bamboo are quite interesting. I like how lightweight they are and that they are made of natural products. You get for bamboo toothbrushes in This set. I didn&#x27;t think that I was going to get such a nice toothbrushing out of it since the toothbrush looks kind of simple, but it did scrub my teeth well. Also the shape of the. Bristles help get in between the little grooves in between your teeth. It feels good to use a sustainable product. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions..</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for more natural products to use in my everyday life and this Bamboo Toothbrush seemed like the perfect fit to replace my old plastic ones. I was excited to give this a try until the first time I brushed my teeth with it--YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE YOUR FINGER! The bristles are way too soft to do any good cleaning. I tend to like my brush on the moderately firm side and this was more like super soft. I suppose if you like that, then you&#x27;ll love this product. But I was great disappointed. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I do appreciate the natural materials. But somehow they&#x27;ve got to make it firmer for me to use or it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
    <li> Made wonderfully and really last!! Great for the environment!!! :-) my 87 year old mother, with all her teeth, absolutely loved these!!!!</li>
    <li> I love them. The Medium bristles are firm. More stiff than most mediums, while still being just as bending/giving. I love the shape of the bristles too, a nice inverted sine wave. The wide brush handle gives a good grip, yet, very light weight. There is no plastic window, as in the picture. No extra packaging!</li>
    <li> Picked these up during Prime Day in July and it was a great deal. Very good toothbrush - small - soft but durable.  My 5-year-old nephew was thrilled to receive one because it fit his mouth better than standard toothbrush. I like it because I feel like I get good coverage with a good product.</li>
    <li> Really nice set of toothbrushes. After using these I don&#x27;t see myself going back to a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I really am enjoying these bamboo toothbrushes. It just feels cleaner. Totally different feel than brushing with plastic. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> We purchased these toothbrushes a couple of weeks and really like them.  The handle feels great in our hands, it has a really good feel to it.  The bristles are just right.  There isn&#x27;t anything not to like about these toothbrushes.  We will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Packaging was not at all as pictured. I can not use these as intended due to packaging and will not buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! Goes very well with my decor. Feels great, fits comfortably in my hand. This also makes a great kids toothbrush! My 6 year old loves hers.</li>
    <li> Pretty good delicate, soft, and cleans really really well because of the slim size</li>
    <li> Brushes are pretty great, I use a home made powder toothpaste and I love that this brush has not turned colors yet and it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell like the other brushes.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush with little expectations as they were on sale for the Amazon Prime day. I was using a toothbrush I got from my dentist before this and I just tried the bamboo toothbrush out literally like 5 minutes ago. It felt like I was giving my mouth a massage! Lol My mouth felt very clean afterwards as well and feels natural in my hand. This might be the last kind of toothbrush I ever buy. I will also be recommending them to my friends and family. You should absolutely give this toothbrush a try. :)</li>
    <li> even though these toothbrushes are all natural, the packaging still has a plastic window. The box itself is biodegradable, but the windows aren&#x27;t... It&#x27;s super hard to live without plastic; I get it. But, it irrites me when companies who believe in using all natural products, conform to using plastic windows on their boxes. To be honest, I&#x27;d buy this product without the boxes. Boxes only make things look more appealing for 3 seconds, and then they are not even used anymore. I love this product, but I want them to be 100% biodegradable boxes, or not even have them at all.</li>
    <li> I like the experience of the natural bamboo in my mouth rather than man-made plastic and the rubbery stuff that makes up the ususal toothbrush handles. These bamboo toothbrushes add to my health and happiness in life.</li>
