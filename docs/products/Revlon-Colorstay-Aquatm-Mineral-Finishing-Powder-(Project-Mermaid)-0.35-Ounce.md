<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product but I bought medium and it is just slightly darker than I had expected. It is a medium, but a little darker than other &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; products I use.</li>
    <li> I have been having loose powder mixed for me for years, but am running low and the company I order from is out of stock indefinitely! Sooo, I searched for the perfect replacement for a long time and am super happy about this product. First and most importantly the color match was PERFECT! I have a medium complexion with yellow undertone and the translucent medium is PERFECT! Secondly when applying it the coolness and the lightness was AWESOME! I use a large kabuki brush to apply it instead of the little brush it came with. I will not need to go back to the loose powder I&#x27;ve been using for years. This finishing powder is a great price and all around incredible. You must try to to believe it!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin dry. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. It might work for other people but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! Lots of complements like, &amp;#34;you look so radiant, you&#x27;re glowing, you&#x27;re skin looks great!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It looks like a powder but when you put it on it feels like a liquid. It&#x27;s good but I should have bought a shade lighter.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on so smoothly, a must have to finish the makeup process. You definitely know its looks good just by the feel of putting it on. Love this!</li>
    <li> I love this powder, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for over a year. It has good coverage and stays on all day (even when I sweat). I believe I only paid .55, which is a steal. I would have paid $10.00 in stores. The description said that there was damage to the package, but I could not find any damage at all.</li>
    <li> I love this make up.  Has a very soft and cooling effect.  Blends well and color is exactly what it says.  I have bought quite a few of these for myself and my daughter and don&#x27;t plan on stopping my need :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best finishing powder I have ever used. It sets your foundation beautifully and it lasts all day. I love the design of the product and the brush is very good and soft. It works wonderfully. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Received this in a timely manner. It gives my makeup a great glow without the greasy shine..excellent product</li>
    <li> Leaves an airbrushed finish, but too much powder can settle in the creases of your skin, etc. so go easy with this (as with any powder). Has a strange smell too (not strong, but.not pleasant?) , but it&#x27;s only noticeable when you&#x27;re putting it on and the brush is close to your face. Also made my face look a little pink (i have a light/medium tan with yellow undertones). Not a noticeable pink, but just a little flushed? Pretty good overall though.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would cover the red on my nose.  I tend to not use it versus the other brands because of the color.  The brush is cut in a way that makes it always seem wet which is very strange.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly but incorrect shade. Not sure what to do with it since it cost so much to get to me in Trinidad and Tobago and I dont usually mix my shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update: It blends well with my foundation, it is not as bad as I thought initially!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product in a local discount store. For some reason they stopped carrying. I tried several other finishing powders that did not meet my expectations. I decided to seach online to find it and Amazon had the best price. Now I will never be without my favorite powder again.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> It was what I expected. Makes skin look even toned and blends very well together to hide spots and blemishes. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Darker than I wanted but still like the product.</li>
    <li> Too wet feeling. There was crack in the bottle when I opened</li>
    <li> The only thing I hate is that it seems the only place I can find this product anymore is online. It use to be at every grocery and drug store - Now Poof! It&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;It feels has a nice cooling touch when you apply it, like it is a tiny splash of cold water. Good coverage while still seeing your skin through it.</li>
    <li> I love the smooth matte finish that I get after applying this finishing powder. Makes a huge difference! It&#x27;s a great step-up from just using BB cream only.</li>
