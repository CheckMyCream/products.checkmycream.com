      <li>Most affordable Jason Sea Kelp Shampoo-</li>
      <li>Shouldn&#x27;t even come with a dispenser top.</li>
      <li>sometimes I don&#x27;t even need the conditioner, but I love it</li>

      <li>My hair does feel pretty clean after however my hair has been a little greasier than normal.</li>

      <li>Personally, I&#x27;m tired of smelling like lavender and oranges, so this is a huge relief for me.</li>

<li> /&gt;It was hard to figure out how to work the pump, and then it&#x27;s again a gluey mess to transfer since the large, heavy bottle is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My hair was still frizzy and it felt dried out after use.</li>
<li> I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t want all the sulfates and chemicals that stripped my hair of its natural oils.  </li>

<li> You couldn&#x27;t buy the bad shampoo that actually tests on animals and contains all sorts of chemicals for the price you can get this for.</li>

    <li> This is a great bargain for how much shampoo you get. But.. it makes my hair dry and flat. Also I do not like the smell, I am not sure what component produces it but the shampoo smells like  plastic to me.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few brands/types I can use due to my extreme allergies--that doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair or make my hair look flat and dull. Usually all natural shampoos have trouble lathering and washing out, but this is great &amp; it has so much of a conditioning effect sometimes I don&#x27;t even need the conditioner, but I love it so I buy that too. This size and price is a great value also. It&#x27;s perfect for my thick, wavy hair</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is all natural, don&#x27;t really have a major problem with it. My hair does feel pretty clean after however my hair has been a little greasier than normal.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my mom. I started doing the no-poo thing but found that my hair was falling out way more than what was considered normal. My mom suggested this product.  I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t want all the sulfates and chemicals that stripped my hair of its natural oils.  But after looking into the product some more, it actually does not have the chemicals I was trying to avoid.  Sweet!  Anyway, I use this shampoo and do not need to use conditioner.  It lathers a lot so I don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  It leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy.  Also, I do not shed as much as I did before using the shampoo.  And 32oz for $15 total??  DEAL!!  It&#x27;s $12 for 16oz in the store.  Awesome. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this shampoo. It was certainly well priced for a generous amount of product. The shampoo was adequate as far as shampoos go, but it didn&#x27;t really work for my hair. My hair was still frizzy and it felt dried out after use. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, but it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s free from animal testing and is missing all the nasty chemicals as well. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. You couldn&#x27;t buy the bad shampoo that actually tests on animals and contains all sorts of chemicals for the price you can get this for. At this price nobody has an excuse not to buy shampoo that it is better for you, better for the environment, that is animal cruelty free, AND actually works.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo. Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t include many of the nasty and harsh chemicals found in most shampoos. My hair feels thicker and lighter (not as much waxy residue as before). Will keep using this.</li>
    <li> This is the only place where I can get sea kelp shampoo.  It makes your hair so soft.  Delivery is very quick.</li>
    <li> I really love this. After just one wash my hair felt so much thicker than usual! I thought pantene was good but I had no idea how weighed down my hair was!</li>
    <li> Shampoo and conditioner was average, worked ok, shampoo smelled ok, but the conditioner smells like horse urine and I will not use the conditioner for that reason.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo but the dispenser shattered immediately. Shouldn&#x27;t even come with a dispenser top. Would be better if the top was flip style.</li>
    <li> smells great and leaves your hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t damage hair! It is also not tested on animals which is the main reason for my purchase.</li>
    <li> Most affordable Jason Sea Kelp Shampoo- the pumping system helps with using less shampoo which in turn makes it last longer.</li>
    <li> I strongly dislike the scent.</li>
    <li> I got this version because the smaller bottle was very hard to open the pop top and incredibly thick and gluey when I tried to transfer it to an other company&#x27;s bottle. After breaking my wrist, i thought I&#x27;d try the pump version, but it&#x27;s too heavy to easily lift or have in the shower without risking breaking the shower head (where our other shampoos/soaps are suspended.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to figure out how to work the pump, and then it&#x27;s again a gluey mess to transfer since the large, heavy bottle is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a simple shampoo without toxic additives and no toxic scent, but it still has a version of Sodium Laurel Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it&#x27;s hard to rinse off hands or hair and the effect on my hair is not much better than plain soap.</li>
    <li> The best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve run into, and it is safe and natural. I recommend this especially for guys who like a lighter, clean, natural scent. Personally, I&#x27;m tired of smelling like lavender and oranges, so this is a huge relief for me. I use this with the Jason Tea Tree Body Wash and think they are the ultimate combination! Lathers amazingly too.</li>
    <li> Bottle was leaking when delivered, good thing it was in a bag. Other than that it smells good and works on my hair.</li>
    <li> my favorite shampoo and much cheaper than my local shop.</li>
