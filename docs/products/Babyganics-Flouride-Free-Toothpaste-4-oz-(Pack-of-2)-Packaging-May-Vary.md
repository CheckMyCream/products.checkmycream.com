      <li>Price here is way better that anywhere else I looked and with subscribe and save even better!!</li>
      <li>Cannot ask for more!  </li>
      <li>The first bottle we used I would give it 5 stars, tasted great and my kid loved it&lt;br</li>
      <li>was looking for a toothpaste that is safe to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My kids love this toothpaste and I can find comfort in knowing that they aren&#x27;t swallowing harmful chemicals and don&#x27;t have to worry about fluoride.</li>
      <li>I love this company and their products.</li>
      <li>Such A Wonderful Product!!</li>
      <li>both love it.  </li>
      <li>It its a healthier option than the toddler training toothpastes in the store, but more affordable than the earthsbest brand.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s safe and my kids love the flavor....</li>
      <li>and I love that it is clean!</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s fluoride free -</li>
      <li>What more could you need in a fluoride free toothpaste?</li>
      <li>but this is easily remedied by wetting the toothbursh before brushing.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is just fine.</li>
      <li>It was exactly as advertised!!</li>
      <li>toothpaste is clear (which is great for tricking him on days when he wants to brush his teeth without toothpaste).</li>
      <li>The taste is great, the paste is clear, natural and this product is animal testing free.</li>
      <li>Even when I smell, the strawberry smell is sweet and fruity.</li>
      <li>It has a sickly sweet smell and taste to it, but the baby doesn&#x27;t mind it, so all is well.</li>
      <li>They responded quickly and assured me that they use preservatives to thwart mold growth.  </li>
      <li>The toothpaste is clear, which I really like...and even better, my 21 month old and 8 month old love the taste!</li>
      <li>If more companies would jump on this band wagon of NATURAL products, this country would be a much healthier place!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste with my daughter since she got her first tooth.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>i was concerned when i first order as others mentioned the mold issue.  </li>
      <li>Say Ahh Flouride Free toothpaste for my 12 month old.  </li>
      <li>It makes him more likely to brush his teeth every day without a struggle.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and my toddler</li>
      <li>I am willing to pay for a product line that seeks to educate kids about taking care of themselves and the world they live in though.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I buy two at time to make sure we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>but I can say it makes it much easier to get kids interested in brushing and not shy away from it because of the taste or strange feeling on their gums or new teeth.</li>
      <li>Not sure of the exact benefits from this toothpaste - meaning if it has all the good, too much of the good, too much of the bad etc etc</li>
      <li>My two year old loves this toothpaste, so much that she likes to eat it</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is my daughter&#x27;s favorite and we&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
      <li>Everything is normal like it&#x27;s always been.</li>
      <li>a great brand, we trust and use a lot of their products as we choose to not use such harsh chemicals and additives that are unfortunately in too many products out there these days!</li>
      <li>They did offer a new product, but would not send a refund.  </li>
      <li>When I opened it for the first time it was full of black specks which appear to be MOLD!  </li>
      <li>i tried many other brands but this is the mildest one and the only one that my tod takes.  </li>
      <li>My 17 months old brushed his teeth using this toothpaste for the first time.</li>
      <li>My two year old loves this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>My 23 month old and my 8 month old</li>
      <li>My 3-year old boy has not learnt to spit and rinse his mouth after toothbrushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My 2 year old son loves the flavor of this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old loves that it tastes like strawberries</li>
      <li>My son (20 months) likes it, and it&#x27;s all natural which puts me at ease.  </li>
      <li>i paid close attention when using it and found no quality issue so far.</li>
      <li>and I have to clean it out every few days.</li>
      <li>It does leave the brush bristles fairly hard when it dries, so you need to make sure you rinse and rub your thumb across the bristles before using them the next time.  </li>
      <li>Baby loves it- first tube has no mold issues as other reviews state.</li>
      <li>Put some ointment and went back to our old toothpaste.</li>
      <li>it is almost like liquid gel sou have to be careful not to use too much.</li>
      <li>It can also dry hard on your sink bowl, so make sure you rinse it down the drain after each brushing or you will have to work a bit harder whenever you clean the bathroom.</li>

<li> It does leave the brush bristles fairly hard when it dries, so you need to make sure you rinse and rub your thumb across the bristles before using them the next time.  </li>
<li> Baby loves it- first tube has no mold issues as other reviews state.</li>

<li> After using the flavor of the children like him very much, and don&#x27;t have to worry about will be late in stomach hurt</li>
<li> A pea-sized is sufficient for each brushing so this tube will definitely last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> my little 19 month old can&#x27;t wait every day to brush her teeth</li>
<li> I squirted the whole thing out in my sink and it was just a black moldy mess.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s clear, so it is hard for her to tell how much she&#x27;s squeezed on her brush.</li>
<li> BabyGanics range is not new to me as my boy has been using its hand soap</li>
<li> the other one is going back for sure :(</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t rinse completely off of the toothbrush and makes the bristles dry a little hard</li>
<li> But that is my only complaint.</li>
<li> When he saw it he wanted to know where we got it and wrote the name down</li>
<li> I bought this toothpaste because it contains less chemicals than the Nuk and Gerber brands I can find in the grocery store.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Second bottle didn&#x27;t use because there was black mold floating inside.</li>
<li> Four not five stars because it is a little runny on a toothbrush, so she makes a mess sometimes even with just a drop.</li>
<li> My little one loves the flavor</li>
<li> My little one loves it...</li>
<li> The only real negative is that it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side.</li>
<li> /&gt;Sometimes I think America enjoys being so sick with what is consumed daily around here..........</li>
<li> I freaked out thinking it was something bad before realizing it was a toothpaste.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Very disappointed! My 17 months old brushed his teeth using this toothpaste for the first time. 15 min. later his chin and chicks had big red spots looks like a burnt spot with peeling skin and some liquid. I freaked out thinking it was something bad before realizing it was a toothpaste. Put some ointment and went back to our old toothpaste. Everything is normal like it&#x27;s always been. Never again I&#x27;m using this product. Bought 2 tubes the other one is going back for sure :(</li>
    <li> My 3-year old boy has not learnt to spit and rinse his mouth after toothbrushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a toothpaste that is safe to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BabyGanics range is not new to me as my boy has been using its hand soap and I use the stain remover, the bathroom cleaner and the fabric spray on my boy&#x27;s clothes and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is clear (which is great for tricking him on days when he wants to brush his teeth without toothpaste). A pea-sized is sufficient for each brushing so this tube will definitely last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boy said that the taste is great. Even when I smell, the strawberry smell is sweet and fruity.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this toothpaste...  It tastes good, it&#x27;s organic, and it motivates her to brush her teeth... What more could you need in a fluoride free toothpaste?</li>

    <li> My dentist loves this toothpaste. When he saw it he wanted to know where we got it and wrote the name down and so the assistant.</li>
    <li> My little one loves the flavor</li>
    <li> Not sure of the exact benefits from this toothpaste - meaning if it has all the good, too much of the good, too much of the bad etc etc but I can say it makes it much easier to get kids interested in brushing and not shy away from it because of the taste or strange feeling on their gums or new teeth. At the same time I dont think its sweet enough that it would make the transition to a normal mint or related toothpaste difficult.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this toothpaste it&#x27;s safe and my kids love the flavor....my little 19 month old can&#x27;t wait every day to brush her teeth</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste and I can find comfort in knowing that they aren&#x27;t swallowing harmful chemicals and don&#x27;t have to worry about fluoride. The taste is great, the paste is clear, natural and this product is animal testing free.</li>

    <li> This toothpaste is just fine. It has a sickly sweet smell and taste to it, but the baby doesn&#x27;t mind it, so all is well.</li>
    <li> Such A Wonderful Product!! It was exactly as advertised!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!! I highly recommend this product!! I love that it&#x27;s fluoride free - My 4 year old loves that it tastes like strawberries :) WIN WIN!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased BabyGanics Say Ahh Flouride Free toothpaste for my 12 month old.  When I opened it for the first time it was full of black specks which appear to be MOLD!  I emailed the company.  They responded quickly and assured me that they use preservatives to thwart mold growth.  They did offer a new product, but would not send a refund.  If you \\&quot;google\\&quot; it, you will see that mold in their toothpaste is a reoccuring issue reported.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old son loves the flavor of this toothpaste. It makes him more likely to brush his teeth every day without a struggle. It doesn&#x27;t rinse completely off of the toothbrush and makes the bristles dry a little hard but this is easily remedied by wetting the toothbursh before brushing. The only real negative is that it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side. I am willing to pay for a product line that seeks to educate kids about taking care of themselves and the world they live in though.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Only toothpaste shell brush her teeth with!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is clear, which I really like...and even better, my 21 month old and 8 month old love the taste! Great value for the cost.</li>
    <li> My son (20 months) likes it, and it&#x27;s all natural which puts me at ease.  Cannot ask for more!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great tasting toothpaste- no yucky stuff in it at all!!&lt;br /&gt;This a great brand, we trust and use a lot of their products as we choose to not use such harsh chemicals and additives that are unfortunately in too many products out there these days! If more companies would jump on this band wagon of NATURAL products, this country would be a much healthier place!!&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I think America enjoys being so sick with what is consumed daily around here.......... It boggles my mind.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because it clumps up where it comes out and I have to clean it out every few days. But that is my only complaint. Very happy with it otherwise!</li>
    <li> My two year old loves this toothpaste, so much that she likes to eat it :)  It lasts a while and I will buy this product and brand again.  I also like that it&#x27;s a 2 pack so I can put one upstairs and one downstairs.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste. She&#x27;s only two and swallows all of it, but since it doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t need to worry. This is the second tube we&#x27;ve purchased. It lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve used it too and it does taste just like strawberries.</li>
