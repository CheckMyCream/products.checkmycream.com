      <li>Best self tanner I have ever used and believe me</li>
      <li>Best colored spray tan ..is not orange.</li>
      <li>and I feel Loreal Sublime is the best.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect color.</li>
      <li>Well, this stuff is great!!  </li>
      <li>I found that a sponge glove that can be bought at a beauty supply store is the best for application to prevent streaks and save hands.</li>

      <li>Works really great.</li>

      <li>ok, let me save you the time.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty good.</li>
      <li>But overall a really good product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>No smell and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The color comes out beautiful and deep!</li>
      <li>I love that this is so easy to apply giving an amazing and natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>Initially it smells good but after a while a very light scent appears one is used to from self tanning products.</li>
      <li>you are probably not educating yourself properly to get a great self tan.</li>
      <li>There was one air bag in the box which was supposedly supposed to secure the items, but it was deflated and did nothing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!!  </li>
      <li>You would swear you spent the day working on a gorgeous tan!  </li>
      <li>Love it works great, I mainly use on my face, last longer than bronzer</li>
      <li>(I do it here because there&#x27;s nothing to clean up-</li>
      <li>but then I&#x27;m worried I won&#x27;t get the full tanning effects.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still a tried and true Mystic Tan(at home) lover and fan.</li>
      <li>but I have found this to be true with ALL sunless tanners.</li>
      <li>The tan is pretty and it is super easy to spray on.</li>
      <li>Fast, easy, and quick drying.</li>
      <li>originally was doing very fast</li>
      <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>My favorite by far.</li>
      <li>you want a golden even glow??  </li>
      <li>I always want to wash it off right away</li>
      <li>I used a more expensive product before that had similar results but smelled better, I love a good bargain</li>
      <li>Initially the scent is light and pleasant but it has to be left on the skin to absorb and it begins to smell like musty sunburned skin to me.  </li>
      <li>, light coats and it wasn&#x27;t really showing much after 2-3 coats.</li>
      <li>easy to apply, no mess, no drips.</li>
      <li>This applies easily and works nicely for a quick subtle tan</li>
      <li>The color looks pretty okay, actually.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled when you first put it on.  </li>
      <li>Although, I have to say, it comes out better on skinner areas such as arms.</li>
      <li>I only gave 4 stars b/c it should have more in it for the price.</li>
      <li>First of all, when you spray it on it doesn&#x27;t look like it does anything.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the REAL DEAL!  </li>
      <li>only reason for the 4 versus 5 stars, is I really think they should put more in this bottle.  </li>
      <li>If used as directed, it produces ever super natural color, and, does not leave stains or even trace on clothing, not even on fine white swimwear.</li>
      <li>- there is a fine line between using just enough and looking orange.  </li>
      <li>very runny.  </li>
      <li>I think I bought my bottle at Sephora, but I bet you can get it on Amazon much cheaper.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t like the smell after it sits on the skin awhile.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually much tanner now</li>
      <li>But its so patchy and a lot of color comes in one spray, so mistakes really stick out.</li>
      <li>You can spray your whole body, I just prefer to focus on my legs since that is my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m light skinned and use the deep tan.  </li>
      <li>my skin is very sensitive and does very well with this head to toe!</li>
      <li>While it smells just like any other spray tan - I&#x27;m not sure there is one that smells wonderful - it is buildable and looks absolutely natural.</li>
      <li>Several full body applications pre can.</li>
      <li>Perhaps its a defect in these particular cans.</li>
      <li>I use this product often, prior to photo shoots, and it works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>easy to apply and the can will spray while being help upside down (for when you are trying to spray the backs of your legs!)</li>
      <li>So far, I have been using a can a month this summer, yet keep in mind I may do it once or twice a week .. .</li>
      <li>Looks natural</li>
      <li>The second round probably isn&#x27;t necessary for most</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, it doesn&#x27;t streak, if you get a little drip you can dab it away.</li>
      <li>It was kinda hard putting on because it seemed like it was really light, like air.</li>
      <li>I did two slow coats and it made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>This product gives you instant tan and it looks natural.</li>

    <li> Best self tanner I have ever used and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want a golden even glow??  Then look no further.</li>
    <li> No orange here... lovely scent . Covers my blemishes</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice tan, but you need to spread it not just spray it or you will be blothcy.</li>
    <li> Love this! My favorite by far. No streaking. Fast and easy to use. No orange color. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> easy to apply, no mess, no drips. I get compliments on my tan all year round. People can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a spray. I&#x27;m light skinned and use the deep tan.  I only gave 4 stars b/c it should have more in it for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the idea, but this product, in medium and dark, was extremely bad for my skin.</li>
    <li> It is not a prestige product, so I won&#x27;t rate it as such. From the cheaper self tanning sprays I really love this one the most. The tan is pretty and it is super easy to spray on. Initially it smells good but after a while a very light scent appears one is used to from self tanning products. No big deal though!</li>
    <li> Works really great. Looks natural</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many sunless tanners before and never had a problem. I exfoliated pripr amd added two coats. The tan is supposed to begin developing within a few hours. After 12 hrs I notice absolutely no difference in the color of my skin. Very disappointing! :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this from amazon but I love it! I used to be tanning onsessed. These days I&#x27;d r a there be ghostly white than rsk akin cancer. I love that this is so easy to apply giving an amazing and natural looking tan. If you hate it.. you are probably not educating yourself properly to get a great self tan. I give it 4 stars because I&#x27;m having difficulty tanning with the rest of my bodu. Side note- my skin is very sensitive and does very well with this head to toe! Definitely buying from amazon after this reviee. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper .... especially when they have a coupon deal!</li>
    <li> I use this product often, prior to photo shoots, and it works exactly as advertised. If used as directed, it produces ever super natural color, and, does not leave stains or even trace on clothing, not even on fine white swimwear. Several full body applications pre can.</li>
    <li> The color looks pretty okay, actually. The problem is applying it evenly; since you can&#x27;t use your hands to apply it, you rely on the spray to evenly coat the skin (which it does not).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used he medium to dark Loreal Sublime for years and decided to try the deep. Let me say that you do have to spray it on and then go over it with a second coat and I use gloves rubbing i in as I go. I always start at my feet and work my way up. Always exfoliate before applying any sunless tanner as this helps to keep it from being blotchy. The color comes out beautiful and deep! You do have to be careful with your feet because they can come out blotchy if you arent careful but I have found this to be true with ALL sunless tanners. I have used just about every sunless tanner out there and I feel Loreal Sublime is the best. My only complaint would be that the sprayer is very hard to push down which was not the case with the medium to dark Sublime. Perhaps its a defect in these particular cans.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was hopeful that it would work. I have light or fair skin. So I&#x27;m not that white. I had a nice tan on my legs from running, but the rest of my body looked lighter, I tried going out in the sun but I would&#x27;ve had to go out there for a long time. So I wanted to try a self spray tan. It was kinda hard putting on because it seemed like it was really light, like air. I applied it and the next morning my hands were orange in certain spots, my feet were dark in different spots, my arms, legs, and stomach had streaks. I also had spots wear it was my natural tone and then dark. I wouldn&#x27;t waste $8 to look orange for a week.</li>
    <li> so i use these all the time usually buy from a store, but decided to order this i didnt see any difference in color and mine smelled kind of like pine which is weird... maybe these go bad? maybe i got a bad one?</li>
    <li> Great color, smells good, lasts all day</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it has a great scent and dries quickly.  Instructions say no need to rub it in, but I find that if I use my hand to spread it evenly over my legs, there is less chance of any streaking.  I wash my hands immediately after and have had no problems with them being stained.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to apply evenly. Even when I think I got it, it comes out in streaks and patches. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Although, I have to say, it comes out better on skinner areas such as arms.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on evenly and gives me a nice color without the bad smell that other products give.</li>
    <li> The items were correct, but 2/5 had broken tips which make it impossible to use the product. Also, one of the bottles are smashed. There was one air bag in the box which was supposedly supposed to secure the items, but it was deflated and did nothing. Waste of money for the ones that I can&#x27;t use.  I want to return.</li>
    <li> Best colored spray tan ..is not orange. My skin tends to go orange with all self tanners but not this one.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday on my face and neck. Gives me a little color so I don&#x27;t look so pale</li>
    <li> I love it. It can leave streaksat times but i think that was my fault. But overall a really good product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, perfect size and I love my color results. Great product.</li>
    <li> This applies easily and works nicely for a quick subtle tan however it leaves the skin feeling a little sticky and I really don&#x27;t like the smell after it sits on the skin awhile.  Initially the scent is light and pleasant but it has to be left on the skin to absorb and it begins to smell like musty sunburned skin to me.  I always want to wash it off right away but then I&#x27;m worried I won&#x27;t get the full tanning effects.  I used a more expensive product before that had similar results but smelled better, I love a good bargain so I&#x27;ll use this one for now.</li>
    <li> You know how in the summer you have white legs and tan arms?  Well, this stuff is great!!  You can spray your legs and you look healthy and a tan, not overly tan.  You can spray your whole body, I just prefer to focus on my legs since that is my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for the 4 versus 5 stars, is I really think they should put more in this bottle.  It&#x27;s a big bottle, yet you can tell there is alot of air in it and little solution.  So far, I have been using a can a month this summer, yet keep in mind I may do it once or twice a week .. . that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YET, it is cheaper than driving to a spray tan place, or tanning beds.  And much more convenient.</li>
    <li> It creates a lovely bronze  glow that is a healthy suntanned look!..I use it about 2 to 3 times a week.  I found that a sponge glove that can be bought at a beauty supply store is the best for application to prevent streaks and save hands.</li>
    <li> TURNED ME BLOTCHY AND ORANGE! UGGGGH</li>
    <li> very runny.  I tried to spread it evenly and it still only ended up covering parts of my skin</li>
    <li> No smell and easy to apply. Love it.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm!  I used this for a Hulk Hogan costume for Halloween.  Within a couple hours, my skin was getting noticeably darker.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner I used so far. Love the spray feature.</li>
    <li> By far the best spray tan out there</li>
    <li> Color is good, dries well. But its so patchy and a lot of color comes in one spray, so mistakes really stick out. Even when sprayed evenly, the spray bottle lets out bursts of liquid sometimes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the REAL DEAL!  You would swear you spent the day working on a gorgeous tan!  Smells nice , goes on easily without streaking and lasts!  Highly recommend!!!!  Don&#x27;t be fooled when you first put it on.  It seems like it isn&#x27;t doing anything but after a few hours - TAN!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.  Color is nice and not orange looking.  I&#x27;ve had people compliment me on my nice tan!</li>
    <li> Love it works great, I mainly use on my face, last longer than bronzer</li>
    <li> Not a fan of how it looks.</li>
    <li> ok, let me save you the time. This is another self tanner that leaves you streaky and blotchy. If you are looking for a good one that finally does not make you look crazy. This is not it. May work ok for making your arms look darker for an occasion where you are wearing a sleevless shirt but not for all over tan.</li>
    <li> easy to apply and the can will spray while being help upside down (for when you are trying to spray the backs of your legs!) sometimes my legs will look a little splotchy the next morning (when i apply in a rush) but another quick coat fixes it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Just be careful - there is a fine line between using just enough and looking orange.  Be sparing with this darker shade, but when used appropriately, the color and glow couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> This product gives you instant tan and it looks natural.</li>
    <li> This spray on tan is good and bad. First of all, when you spray it on it doesn&#x27;t look like it does anything. I thought I had to spray a lot on for it to work, but it turns out a little goes a long way. Also, it does leave streaks if you don&#x27;t put it on EVENLY, which is hard to do so. I got random spots of darkness from not putting it on evenly even though I thought I did. The color is  a little too dark for my skin tone, but it does come out looking tanner the next day. Make sure you spray it at least six inches away otherwise it will leave dark spots where you spray to close. In all, like the tan/color, but leaves massive steaks!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I tanned all through my youth and prefer to be a dark color, but now I am in my 30s and have become all too aware of the sun&#x27;s effect and aging. Well, I find this to be a terrific solution.  It&#x27;s really not too dark but builds as dark as you want it to.  In fact under my spray I am whiter than white.  But a couple times a week I step in the tub and spray myself (I do it here because there&#x27;s nothing to clean up- just turn the water on after you are done).  Then usually after thirty minutes to an hour I spray my legs and arms again.  I even spray my face during the first round.  The second round probably isn&#x27;t necessary for most but I like to keep myself nice and brown. Also I should add that this stuff is dry in just a few minutes and has hardly any &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;. I say scent because it&#x27;s not a typical gross tanner smell.&lt;br /&gt;I had a great realization how much better this stuff is the other day because I thought I could rub on some lotion the other day and succeed without any streaks or dark spots. Nope. I turned out horrible and had to scrub for days in the shower. Back to the spray for me. As long as you pay attention with even streaks you will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that I use subscribe and save. I am never without a tan and I save money in the process.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good. You don&#x27;t get orange, you actually turn a brownish bronze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally was doing very fast, light coats and it wasn&#x27;t really showing much after 2-3 coats. I did two slow coats and it made a huge difference. I&#x27;m actually much tanner now and it&#x27;s the perfect color. The can probably has about 5 good coats in it.</li>
    <li> Terible product. It left my skin all dirty and fade awful</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast, easy, and quick drying.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product after I read all if the great reviews. I even exfoliated, as the directions recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I am of Italian heritage and naturally tan, but in the winter wanted a little extra color. PROS:The color was not streaky, and it did go on light.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  I wasn&#x27;t expecting ORANGE like the 90s, but it was definitely orange enough my friends new what I had tried.  I looked like an Oompa Loompa. My feet even turned orange!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is NOT fresh orange, it smells like every other nasty spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every tanning product under the sun (ba dam dum) and I&#x27;m still a tried and true Mystic Tan(at home) lover and fan. I think I bought my bottle at Sephora, but I bet you can get it on Amazon much cheaper. It&#x27;s worth the price, it doesn&#x27;t streak, if you get a little drip you can dab it away. While it smells just like any other spray tan - I&#x27;m not sure there is one that smells wonderful - it is buildable and looks absolutely natural. I also like Jergens Natural Glow for a buildable tan in the winter and haven&#x27;t found too much trouble with streaking, but I can smell the \\&quot;smell.\\&quot;</li>
