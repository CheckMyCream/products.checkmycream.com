<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used the while bottle of this shampoo and conditioner and didn&#x27;t see any results. I moved onto another frizz shampoo that also did nothing.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and it&#x27;s half the price of what I&#x27;d pay at the mall.</li>
    <li> I have other variations of NEXXUS that have treated my hair well, mainly conditioner. I Have frizzy mixed hair and has excited when I saw the promises of this to tame and prevent dryness my heart jumped. And the 2$ off coupon to sweeten the deal I had to have it. I have only given it one wash so far and it gave me such horrendous dandruff I was mortified. I am going to give it one more try when I can risk such massive flakes before I try to return it or retire it to the corner for products of shame.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite  shampoo for my natural curly hair , really helps get rid of frizz.</li>
    <li> I am unable to find this product in stores at this time.  The package arrived as expected.  Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very ordinary shampoo which I bought because of all the positive reviews. It won&#x27;t stop your curly hair from frizzing in humid weather and isn&#x27;t especially moisturising . Won&#x27;t bother buying it again</li>
    <li> This shampoo does everything it says. My hair has never been softer or so un-frizz-tastic. I really love this hair care line. I have pretty much every cross defy product and my hair looks awesome. :)</li>
    <li> Such a great product if you have thick hair. My order came earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I really like this shampoo.  It&#x27;s a tad bit more than I like to pay for shampoo and that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  It makes our hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.  So good that a conditioner is not even needed.  Already ordered more.  Try it and see.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for straight hair. xoxo</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and Conditioner left a film in my hair.  So, my hair was no longer fizzy, but it didn&#x27;t feel clean either.  I do have very fine, so maybe that is why it did not work well.  But I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I know I am in a dry climate but come on. I tried this shampoo out. I used it according to the directions along with the conditioning treatment and then the regular conditioner and the after shower hair product that is suppose to help de-frizz the hair. To say the least my hair is still frizzy and with the hair product is now greasy and dry. It dried my hair out more than it was using a dollar store brand of cheap shampoo. I will Not ever buy this again I am going with the Loreal Keratin smooth shampoo better reviews and hopefully a better product.</li>
    <li> I used this brand for years, but only  the conditioner, it makes my hair shiny and smelling nice. I got the shampoo to see if together they will work better. It was no change for better or for worst.&lt;br /&gt; So I will stay with my generic shampoo, but use NeXXus conditioner.</li>
    <li> Expensive and DID NOT help with my frizz.</li>
    <li> I use Nexus products all the time, but this is the first time I use the Frizz Defy Shampoo and it does work !!! Use it along with the hair conditioner and the heat styling products for frizzy hair and you&#x27;ll see the difference!</li>
    <li> I have used nexxus since I was a child, my mother was a beautician..... I love Nexxus and my hair knows the difference when I use something else. Leaves my curly, thick hair very smooth. I haven&#x27;t used this type of Nexxus yet in the Summer though. I am hoping it will pass with flying colors.</li>
    <li> This shampoo goes great with the Frizz Defy conditioner as they work really well together.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product seems to work well, but a common problem I have is these products can start to weigh my hair down and this does. So about every 3rd day, I alternate to another shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love all Nexxus products. This one in particular has helped out quite a bit with the frizz. My love for their products stems from how silky and smooth my hair feels after using this product.</li>
    <li> My wife is currently deployed to Afghanistan and still requested this shampoo. I ordered her a few bottles and she could not be happier. Amazon shipped the item quickly and it arrived undamaged. Wife actually said she sticks out now because other women who are there cant clean their hair as well.</li>
    <li> helps frizzy ooooooooooolllllllllllldddd hair</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my frizzy hair but overall was not a bad shampoo- just don&#x27;t expect miracles from it!</li>
