<li> its all dried up and not very liquidy.</li>
<li> It takes a ton of this stuff to do anything, and then it weighs it down.  </li>
<li> Once i opened and used it, there was clearly something wrong with it.</li>
<li> that is absolutely limp.</li>
<li> My hair had become drier, but also &#x27;coarser&#x27; in the past couple of years.</li>
<li> something was wrong with mine.</li>
<li> I tried to find a comparable shampoo to MorrocanOil brand which is just too expensive.  </li>

    <li> LOVE IT!!  Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> I would use this only for repairing dry, damaged hair.  I have thick hair that is in good shape and the day after shampooing, it felt dirty and heavy.  I tried to find a comparable shampoo to MorrocanOil brand which is just too expensive.  This didn&#x27;t cut it. On the positive side, it smells great and if you have hair in need of repair, it would be great.</li>
    <li> Nice product, great smell</li>
    <li> something was wrong with mine. i buy this kind of shampoo and love it! so i ordered a big bottle on amazon but didnt actually use it right away. Once i opened and used it, there was clearly something wrong with it. its all dried up and not very liquidy. but it still works, but i have to use more. i woulda exchanged it if i had noticed sooner.</li>
    <li> It smells, fells very natural.I like it. but you need to use conditioner together. so your hair don&#x27;t fell dry.</li>
    <li> It keeps my daughter&#x27;s hair really tangle free and smelling fabulous! I love that it isn&#x27;t full of a lot of the sulfates and parabens in other shampoos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and its conditioner partner revived my 60+ years-old hair to its former shiny glory.  Discovered these products \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; (came with a hair dryer I bought) and now would use nothing else.  Not only does it work wonders on restoring the shine, vitality and body my aging hair had lost but the fragrance is divine.  It truly is better for my hair than the most expensive, top-of-the-line big name products.  I use nothing else on my hair now and, when forced to substitute through running out while traveling, I could really see a negative change in my hair.  I imagine it would also improve hair that is young and vibrant if it worked such wonders for mine.  I order in bulk now to ensure I won&#x27;t run out. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> made my hair feel very healthy and soft</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Shampoo ever. It is not harsh on the hair and for all hair types too, so inexpensive as well.</li>
    <li> My cousin, a stylist, recommended this for my mom and I used hers and was hooked! It smells soooooo goooood and makes my hair smooth and shiny. I have fine, thin, wavy hair and love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair had become drier, but also &#x27;coarser&#x27; in the past couple of years. It just didn&#x27;t feel good! I tried many shampoos, store bought ones and some salon bought ones. I really was not happy with any, until I found this. It truly nourishes and restores your hair!</li>
    <li> This product rocks! The entire line is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. I think this ranks right up there with Wen, sorry Chaz but at a fraction of the price it wins hands down</li>
    <li> Hair has gone (with age) from oily to drier and needs a bit more moisture. This product was recommended by my stylist and gives me a nice look without drying my hair or looking to &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34;. Also using the companion conditioner, which I have reviewed too.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not bad but I found a better one but its not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> It did not leave my hair soft nor shine thought the scent of the shampoo is pleasent it did not do what I read.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t lather much the first wash. I bought it because my scalp is dry. I do not have dandruff, and I really needed a good moisturizing shampoo. I have not found One&#x27;n&#x27;Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair shampoo to help my dry scalp. I do like the way it makes my hair smell, which is why I rated it 3 stars. Just wish the fragrant smell lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I used this at a friend&#x27;s house a little over a year ago and immediately had to buy my own. This product gives my hair such body it looks like I came from the salon. Whether I wear it straight or curly my hair feels so soft and it just bounces and swings. I always get tons of compliments on it. The shampoo has a very light musky, floral scent. (I think that&#x27;s the smell of the argan oil). This is my go-to; I don&#x27;t use any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well to leave my hair clean without any buildup.  It is a very good shampoo in that it does not contain any of the additives to which I am allergic.</li>
    <li> good product would buy again</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo! Good smell, my hair feels great afterward, and very reasonably priced. Does not lather well, though, but I&#x27;m used to that with these types of natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate this stuff, but I have used cheap drugstore conditioners that can make my hair look better.  It takes a ton of this stuff to do anything, and then it weighs it down.  With this stuff, my options are unmanageable hair with volume or semi smooth hair that is absolutely limp.</li>
