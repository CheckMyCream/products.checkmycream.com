      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would liked for the roller to be smaller.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it looked impact for travel, but it works better than any hotomb I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Every time I put it under my hair to start rolling it, the motor slows down and stops. It doesn&#x27;t want to work, unless in an upright position. Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t easy to find the perfect hair tool.  I found mine!  I love this hot air brush.  It heats quickly and really adds volume to my thin hair!</li>
    <li> I already had the 1 1/2&amp;#34; so I knew this is one of the best hot air brush there is. Highly recommended, great quality, don&#x27;t burn your scalp even on the highest heat setting and it doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive and try this based on past comments.  I do not feel it does a better job than my older, different model, which was less expensive and less powerful.  I do miss that the tip is hot so I cannot use my other hand to hold that end and assist with curling.  The soft bristles, I think, contribute to my hair not turning out the way I would like it to.  I was hoping a newer model would be quieter but it is as loud if not louder than my older model.  Previous comments mentioned that on/off switch being in an awkward place; that is not an issue with me.  Given a choice, I would not purchase this model again.</li>
    <li> Love these John Frieda Hot Air Brushes -- liked it so much that I purchased both the 1&amp;#34; and 1 1/2&amp;#34; hot air brushes.  They work so well and I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I decided to let my hair grow out and needed a hot air brush to keep the back of my haircut in place.  I am very happy with the quality of the product, and it works extremely well.</li>
    <li> I liked this so much I bought the 1.5 inch as well. I blow dry my hair until it is &amp;#34;almost dry&amp;#34; then I use the heat setting on this to finish it. I really like it. Great to use for a fresh re-do so I am not having to wash my hair every day.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s a straightener and curler all in one!</li>
    <li> I have short hair so r &#x27;s great dries my hair fast and styles</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on a recommendation from my sister who was enjoying hers.  It dries my hair while styling it at the same time, saves time and gives me a more casual look every time.  I really like it, have bought two so that I have one at home and one for travel/back-up.  It takes less time and requires less heat on my hair than the blow-dryer and curling iron, so I feel that my hair is benefitting as well.  I will likely buy another one soon to assure that I always have a back-up in the case of product failure.</li>
    <li> really liked this brush,...I have short hair and this size barrel is perfect for me...I have a bad shoulder and can only use one hand to fix my hair..this  fits the bill......</li>
    <li> It gives my hair volumn and style.  I&#x27;ve used curling irons other hot air brushes but this one is convient and easy to use.  I took it with me on a cruise, my friend used it as well as myself.  Really glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have used many different types of hot air brush, including the ones from Japan where there is ions to protect the hair.  I would say this one is the top choice.  It does produce ions while blow drying hair so that your hair won&#x27;t get dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read all the reviews on this and similar products before purchasing it.  I also chose to go with the 1inch brush rather than the bigger one.  My hair is about 20 inches long from top of the head to bottom.  If you follow the instruction and dry the air up to about 80-90% dry and then use this brush, it is most effective.  It takes me about 5 mins to dry my hair and then I use this brush for about 10 mins.  I can create a set perm look with curls at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in review that some people thinks that the power of this brush is not strong enough.  For setting curls in hair, it actually is more heat than is needed.  In fact, if you use this to dry your hair with high heat, it would dry out your ends.  I would start with heat and then use cool for each strand of hair I curl (like how they do it at the salon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the brush to be really good as it grabs the hair quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is both, a dryer and a brush, so it makes it easy to style your hair. I feel it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as other styling products do. I&#x27; satysfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t work a curling iron or work with a brush and blow dryer, but I CAN use this Hot Air Brush!</li>
    <li> BACK FOR YET ANOTHER ONE!  I had purchased this when I first cut my hair short, thinking that I could style it myself. I had no idea what I was doing. Then someone showed me how to really use it the correct way...and now I can&#x27;t believe what volume and softness I can achieve! I have ear length, fine hair...and I use the 1&amp;#34; size. After using this..my hair feels twice as thick and it holds the set longer than even the rollers that I had been using.  Of course, I always use a mousse and setting gel, so that helps. This is my 3rd purchase of this product...not because any of them have worn out...but so that when the company decides to change the design...as they always do...and NOT with good results...I will have a stockpile of them on hand!  Did I say...I LOVE THIS HOT AIR BRUSH??  THANK YOU JOHN FRIEDA! Terry W Grove City, Ohio</li>
    <li> Worked great for a few months! However, it&#x27;s started sparking when it&#x27;s plugged in and/or turned on. Scared it&#x27;s going to start an electrical fire, so it really shouldn&#x27;t be used anymore. Can&#x27;t return anymore because the return period ended a couple months ago. Hate to pay for the product again just to have it last a few months. What to do!</li>
    <li> GREAT product.  Does wonders to my hair.  I definitely recommend buying this for any hair type.  It is a life savor!</li>
    <li> I like this hot air brush, the one problem is the tip is to short and I have to watch that I don&#x27;t burn my fingers.</li>
    <li> I loved this until it went on the fritz, literally on the day it became ineligible to return via Amazon.  The cord is loose where it connects to the wand so it switches off while you are using it, and then back on again as you move the wand around.  I assume as time goes on it will stop working altogether.  Really disappointed</li>
    <li> works great on my fine hair. doesnt tangle</li>
    <li> I like this product; however I have very short hair, so I wish the brush size was smaller.  I like it enough, that I am growing my hair out slightly.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair.  This hot air brush has a very anemic air flow that, even with my type of hair, takes much to long to dry, lift and volumize my hair.  Also, I did not want just volume, I wanted to be able to enhance my curly hair.  The barrel is much to big to make a curl in my short hair (about 3-4 inches long bangs and top).&lt;br /&gt;If you want volume only I still think a round brush and a good wattage hair dryer will get better/quicker results.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that tends to frizz, this tool is for you.  My hair is very fine and this brush eliminates the frizz and gives me lots of body.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I only have mobility in one arm and this product styles and dries my hair in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I have gone from &amp;#34;wash and wear&amp;#34; to styled hair.&lt;br /&gt;The product is light weight and I really love the swivel cord at the end of the unit. It allows me to twirl my hair while drying without the cord getting tangled.&lt;br /&gt;The one inch model is larger than expected, but works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the Hot Air Brush is very good.</li>
    <li> I am sure it would be fine, if for the it was intended.  I wanted to brush and curl, and I guess it is for straightening hari.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works so good especially when your in a hurry.  Love!!</li>
    <li> This just arrived today. Used it once and I&#x27;ll have to say the easiest, quickest, and smoothest styling I&#x27;ve ever been able to do myself. It gave the type of styling that I never can recreate from the salon. Haven&#x27;t tested it out in the humidity yet.  However...when I finished using it in the sink I noticed 15 bristles of the brush had either dropped out, or easily came out. There aren&#x27;t that many bristles to begin with. I&#x27;ll have to watch it in the next few days and see if it continues to drop bristles. I suppose if it does, I may have to look into returning it. I hope not, because I loved using it. So much better than having to use a dryer and separate round brush. The three temps are great. I got the 1\\&quot; vs 1.5\\&quot; and right now hair is above-chin length and this size was perfect. I&#x27;ve only seen 1.5\\&quot; in a store. (I let hair air dry till almost dry, then used the brush to style).  Update: 11-13-14 The brush stopped dropping bristles. I continue to use it (not daily) and am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife has MS&lt;br /&gt; Normal hair dryers make her to hot so she doesn&#x27;t like to use them. I got her this as a gift. Works great and she doesn&#x27;t over heat. It has been a blessing and she is not afraid to do her hair now.</li>
    <li> Like it very much. Brush is soft, yet grips hair nicely. Lightweight for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it had a larger cool tip at the top of the brush to hold on to while styling.</li>
    <li> The cord kept shorting out during use.I didn&#x27;t trust it.Sent it back!</li>
    <li> I seldom review products I have purchased, but this hot air brush is a great product.  I have fine, short hair and, although the curl doesn&#x27;t hold in humid weather, my hair still has a little body.  After careful review, I&#x27;m  glad I chose this brush dryer and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have one in 1.5 inches and I ordered this one for my mom. Long lasting and good quality. I dry my hair about 80% of the way before I use this. My hair gets very tangled, and for some reason this cuts right through. Great product.</li>
    <li> Personally I found this a waste of money.  I can blow out my hair faster with a brush.  It seems like it might be good for someone with short, thin hair but guessing for the average person it will create more work than it saves.</li>
    <li> Works great it does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.&lt;br /&gt;I did find it a bit cheaper at a local beauty supply</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great.  The brushes just glide over the hair as they are not strong enough to go threw it.  Would not buy again but use it for a finishing touch after using a strong brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush for curling. The only problem is that my hair was a little too short for the 2 inch round brush. I like that it had two speeds and two temperatures, hot and warm.</li>
    <li> Has great power and is easy to use for volume and curl. I wish the bristles were stronger. Use it with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This hot brush works really good. I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and really like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for even short hair. Just pick the smaller size and and curl is really loose and natural.</li>
    <li> This did not work for ma at all. My hair is very thick, and the brush could barely get through it.</li>
    <li> I refused to spend over $100. for &amp;#34;Perfecter&amp;#34;-to just collect dust like the rest of my appliances. So, I bought this one on Amazon for less than $30. LOVE IT!!!! Another reviewer mentioned fountain of youth for hair- Soooo True!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine/thinning hair, so was afraid hair would get caught in brush &amp; tear out(previous experience)-No worries!&lt;br /&gt;The time it saves(plenty of wattage) &amp; ease of use (don&#x27;t need 2 hands to use i.e.Perfecter) is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;Perfecter says it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;hot to the touch&amp;#34;(?)-what&#x27;s the point then? This gets hot, but your hair is in it, so the heat/burning is neglible. It curls, straightens, smooths, gives awesome volume, shines, etc. Can&#x27;t say enough about this product!&lt;br /&gt;Only question I have is, what took so long(sic)? Thank Goodness-no more &amp;#34;blow outs&amp;#34; @ salon.</li>
    <li> Works well with my shorter hair and also with my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  We each have one and both of us are well satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it but I&#x27;m working on it, I know that when I get how to use it it&#x27;s going to be perfect.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, brush bristles are soft.  Would have been better if there was a spiral release, without having to &amp;#34;unroll&amp;#34; hair, but all-in-all, it&#x27;s a good product. I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description fully.  I thought the brush would rotate but it doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t use it very much because I don&#x27;t like the results</li>
    <li> I studied many of the write-ups before purchasing this hot air brush. Everything that has been said about it is true. The actually brush part is shorter than I have had before but it has the type of &#x27;teeth&#x27; on it that really holds the hair to roll it yet does NOT tangle. The same brush part is a little  narrower than I have had in the past and this is just what I WAS looking for. I wanted something that would leave a little curl vs just more full body. I would highly recommend this hot air brush to all!</li>
    <li> You get solan quality styling at &amp;#34;HOME&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;To speed the process along I blow dryer my hair until it is damp.... then I use the John Frieda hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to clip up your hair and work in sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended to others and they have also purchase and love!</li>
    <li> I have the 1-1/2&amp;#34; hot air brush and love it.  That is why I ordered the 1&amp;#34; - my hair is shorter right no0w.</li>
    <li> I was tired of blow drying my hair and ending up with a million knots in it when I was finished. I bought this product since it had a brush on it and it seems to be doing the job: no more knots!</li>
    <li> This hot air brush has plenty of power and would be a really good product with one minor adjustment. The tip you must hold on to to stabilize it in your hair gets so hot it will burn your fingers. I don&#x27;t understand why this has not been addressed as I have seen the same complaint in many other reviews. I have a hot air brush that cost me $8 that has ample cool space for holding it in place but it doesn&#x27;t have the same heat, air power, nor does it come any larger than 3/4&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda Company - fix this problem; it will cost you a few cents per unit!!</li>
    <li> I have used Remington hot air brushes for years. I love them and never would have strayed, other than with each new release, they are made cheaper and break easier. I decided to try this John Frieda hot air brush instead of getting another cheap Remington. I have fine-normal hair and use these after blow drying my hair until it is just barely damp. I like to flip the ends under and maybe get a little curl. The John Frieda brush will snag my hair very easily and makes it hard to unwind it from the brush. I have never had this problem with the previous brushes I have used. The barrel needs to be a little bit longer as well. If I can manage to get my hair fixed without it snagging, it does make it really smooth. It is not nearly as powerful as the Remington, so I have to use it on high in order to get any definition from it. All in all, I would say this is not a bad air brush, but it could use some improvement.</li>
    <li> If  you like a soft brush then go for it.  I prefer a firmer brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I can&#x27;t hold my left arm up very high so i have a difficult time blow drying and styling my hair. This is a brush and dryer in one, and a dryer that hold consistent high heat at that. I have been using this everyday since receiving it. Love.</li>
    <li> Love it! Used it right away! Gives me nice volume and waves.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it at all. It feels like I&#x27;ve been to the salon every time I use it AND it&#x27;s quicker and easier than straightening. It also leaves my hair shiny and in great condition. Love it!</li>
    <li> The barrel is to big to curl short hair.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this are more like a brush than a comb and as a result (and maybe because of the cold option), it makes my hair shiny, not frizzy. It&#x27;s an upgrade from my old Connair device.</li>
    <li> I like the product; . Unfortunately, I bought the 1 1/2 inch which was too large for my short hair and I didn&#x27;t know where or what were the requirements for returns. So I ended up buying a second one -- 1 inch size. I would have liked an option to buy an even smaller one such as a 3/4 inch barrel for my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the effectiveness without the &amp;#34;hot air&amp;#34; of other brands. I like the soft but firm bristles.</li>
    <li> Maybe for fine hair would work fine.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I bought this. It is very effective and well worth the money. It works well. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like the way this brush curls my hair but have noticed that it has been losing some of the bristles with use.  I have only had it for about a month now and am concerned that it may not last that long due to the bristle loss that seems to be happening.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this air brush as it really did a great job on my hair.  After less than 2 months the heating element apparently burned out.  Not a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Very poor performance, awkward to handle.  No enough power to do anything. Totally useless. I cannot recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  It dries my short hair very fast and it is less noisy than my regular hair dryer.  The only problem I have with it is that it left my hair flat instead of giving it some volume.  I will keep using it and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It works really well on african american hair... i was hesistant beacuse i wasent sure it &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; for my  hair ... smooth finish i love it!!!</li>
    <li> I never had one of these before and this appliance makes my hair very, very shiny and bouncy which is something which is the opposite of my very thin, fine, short hair.  I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Although I like the brush, I do not like the fact that they shortened the electrical cord by 24&amp;#34; making it very short.</li>
    <li> If your hair is thin or you have a toddler that is too young to blow dry her hair this is pretty good. It has a cool, low heat and a high heat. The control is kind of hard to use. I would think it is worth about 15.00.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and a chin-length bob -- this works well on damp to dry hair, but it does not work if it&#x27;s really wet. The manual even states that if the hair is too wet, it&#x27;s recommended to use a standard hair dryer before using this, and I agree. However, I really am a wash-and-wear person, and having to dry my hair is a chore -- I just needed a brush/dryer in one tool so I can get rid of the one part of my head where the hair is just growing the other way. It takes about five minutes to blow my damp hair on HIGH, then I put my hair products, then finish it on LOW. The blowing power is not too impressive -- maybe it&#x27;s because the holes are around the tube of the brush and not focused on one nozzle like the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s OK, I&#x27;m not that impressed; It dries the hair but don&#x27;t expect it to be as quick as a standard blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now, and I think you just have to get used to it to dry hair quicker. I grab small sections of hair and run the brush under it, and that dries it much quickly than flipping hair over and brushing through it. And I&#x27;m starting to like it very much I changed from 3 to 4 stars. Note: You still have to start with 80% dry hair and definitely not dripping wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t give 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like the switch on it. It&#x27;s hard to switch on or between settings. After my hands get residual hair products and I have to do a second round of blow-drying it&#x27;s quite a challenge - I have to dig my thumbnail into the switch to switch it on. I wish they had a better notch or a standard blow dryer switch instead.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love drying and curling my hair at the same time!</li>
    <li> It also seems more well put together than the Hot Tools I had that did not last 8 months before motor died.</li>
    <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t like to fuss in the morning and has no hair sense, this was SO easy to use and has great results!</li>
    <li> Thought this would be just the thing to add lift and curve to my short do without the daily two handed dance with brush and blow dryer. The barrel is 1&amp;#34;, but with the big brush part, more like 2.5&amp;#34; or more across. Brush is way larger than it appears in the photo, and far too big to style my 3&amp;#34; - 4&amp;#34; long hair - except maybe for straight up. Sadly, had to return -- untried.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles that don&#x27;t dig into your head, cord doesn&#x27;t get twisted, and it has multiple selections for temp using a sliding switch that is placed where it won&#x27;t get moved during operation. I could wish for a cool tip, but I&#x27;ve learned how to use it effectively without one. Wish they also made one in a smaller barrel size because I&#x27;d buy that for sure.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair and easy become tired when trying to brush my hair with a round brush and a hair dryer. I reduced it by two stars for two reasons: the bristles are not that stiff and the on/off button is not that great. I have a hard time knowing what setting I am on. Usually click it all the way up and then click one down for high, but its easy to push back down to low.</li>
    <li> There is a learning process, but this item makes the volume in your hair just fantastic.  And, it&#x27;s plenty warm, too.  Be sure to use on damp hair.</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sasson iron is better for my hair.  The bristles in this one are similar to brush bristles which tend to make my hair a bit frizzy.</li>
    <li> Definitely one to buy!  This thing puts out some heat compared to my old one.  I used to have to stand there holding my old one in place waiting for enough heat to warm up my hair to get the curl out.  Not anymore, this thing gets hot super fast and leaves my hair shiny.  I have fine, thin hair and when left for a moment to make a curl, leaves great body and bounce.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and I thought this would me a perfect alternative since I do normally use a blow dryer with a attachable comb. It was disaster. It pulled my hair out more than dried it. So I threw it in the garbage. It didn&#x27;t work for me but I&#x27;m sure it is just because my hair type.</li>
    <li> This a good tool a woman should have when there’s no time to schedule an appointment at the hair salon. It’s easy to use once you get a hang of it. Women with medium to short hair lengths would have no problems but you can pull some out if you have long curls in case you hold it too close to your head and do not act fast enough and turn it off in time. So practice first. It is light, gets hot and cools off when done pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This is am amazing product!  My hairdresser wanted me to use a blow dryer and a brush to style my hair, however doing it on your own doesn&#x27;t come out like it suppose too so when I found this I had to try it.  It not only dries my hair quick but I get amazing results and alot of body in my hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A GREAT hair styles. I have very curly hair I&#x27;d use a  blower;  curlers and a flat iron.  With this great item I can cut styling time by 90%. Every woman should HAVE this.  It is as described fast shipping AND lots cheaper anywhere on the web and stores.  Give it a try you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> My hair was showing signs of distress from the flat iron.  When this tool popped up as a Lightning Deal, I decided to give it a try.  I find it&#x27;s best used on damp hair.  First I blow dry my hair with my regular blow dryer until it&#x27;s damp.  If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll be all day trying to dry with the air brush alone.  When my hair is almost damp, I use the air brush on high. My hair has lots of volume &amp; shine and this tool seems much less damaging to my hair.  The switch is a bit strange.  Pushing the slide the whole way gives only air &amp; no heat.  You need to be careful to back off a click for the maximum heat setting.</li>
    <li> I love this brush soooo freaking much. The heat is evenly distributed and it is so easy and fast to use. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use product. I was a little worried at first. I didnt know if it would blow much air due to the compact size, but it works perfectly. I use it to give volume to bangs (btw, this diameter is ideal for that) and does a great job. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Purchasing the John Frieda 1 Inch Hot Air Brush has made blow drying my hair a lot easier.  I did some research prior to purchasing - brushes that rotated vs. ones that did not.  The preference seemed to be for brushes that did not rotate, so I gave the John Frieda a try, and it works very well.  The only thought I have is that it would be a little easier if the barrel was a little longer at the top so one could hold onto it with the other hand if necessary to help roll the hair.  Right now, if ones tries, the end of the barrel gets too hot to hold at all.  But other than this suggestion, this is a nice hot air brush, at a moderate cost.</li>
    <li> I was never good with a barrel brush and a blow dryer and I have arthritis in my joints so it was really difficult for me to hold both for any length of time.  I got this hot air brush and it is wonderful.  I just wash my hair, put my styling product in, let it air dry for a while and while damp, I use the hot air brush to style.  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that falls out easily. The 1&amp;#34; brush is very soft so easy on the hair for drying and adding volume to hair length just below my chin. Wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> Wonderful styling tool. Love it. Love everything about it.  Right size and one feature is you can choose your heat or cool air.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 6 months and it works just like brand new. I have RA and I can use this air brush without any trouble. Would recommend this because it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> Works really great. I use it on partially dried hair. I would like the hairstyle to last a little longer, but a lot of that has to do with the humidity.</li>
    <li> I love it the only thing that would make this better is if the heads rotated. My fiancé was excited when she got It and it did an amazing job with her hair and cut what used to take 5 hours down to 1-2. Which give me more bathroom time and makes going out easier.</li>
    <li> I used for the first time last night.  Was terrified that my hair would be a frizzy mess (naturally curly and wavy hair), but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  There were elements of &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; when I was done, but I think i just need more practice using it.  I was going to order one of the straighteners that rolls and has the brush, but glad I tried this since I can dry and style my hair at the same time!</li>
    <li> Tended to be very hot on scalp and it didn&#x27;t do much to straighten hair as advertised. Not bad for some uses, but not so great for others.</li>
    <li> I guess I might have been expecting it would give more lift to my hair, but it does give it a sheen and is easier than using hot rollers. So, I&#x27;m getting a perm, then I&#x27;ll get the lift I want.</li>
    <li> This is almost as good as going to the hairdresser. I think once I get the hang of using it to blow dry  and style my hair this will be a real winner. Instead of having a sore wrist on my right arm trying to spin a brush and aggravating a tennis elbow and rotator cuff injury holding the dryer and ending up with a lousy hairstyle, I now have no pain and an almost professional look.</li>
    <li> I spent a long time looking at different hot air brushes and&lt;br /&gt;reading dozens of reviews.  I decided this looked the best&lt;br /&gt;so I purchased one.  My mistake, I did not read it was a two inch&lt;br /&gt;brush.  I began my search again but could only find a 1 1/2 inch&lt;br /&gt;brush.  Suddenly I noticed you could chose a 1 1/2 inch or 1 inch&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon.  I immediately ordered one and am extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;I never could master the blow dryer and brush routine.  This item&lt;br /&gt;gives my hair the body I wanted.  Since my hair is short, maybe&lt;br /&gt;a 3/4 inch brush would be better so if I ever see one I will probably&lt;br /&gt;buy that.  Until then I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love this for my short hair. Hair dries nice and fast, battling the frizzy hair.  I don&#x27;t know how long the bristles will last but I hope this last a long time. I bought the bigger size for my mom as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Not as hot as I would like it to be and heat flow level is not as high as in a hair dryer but it doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp.  It&#x27;s a nice addition to the hair dryer, I&#x27;d say to quickly style your hair.  Actually it is really nice for kids.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s not as loud and is more gentle for kids hair.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. Bought it after I got my hair cut shorter. First had the 1 1/2&amp;#34; version but had to go smallernafter cut. Both work well and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had never used a hot brush before and am still learning! LOL. I Do like the way it leaves a shine in your hair and will keep trying because I like soft hair. I&#x27;ve used Frieda products as long as I can remember and bought it because of his name.</li>
    <li> I marked it down one star because the handle is too big to comfortably hold in my hand.  love all the rest.</li>
    <li> This Hot Air Brush is O.K.  For myself personally, I do not use it very much.  IMHO, it straightens my hair out where I prefer more curl.  It does what it states it will do.</li>
    <li> completely useless, cannot use in the uk as needs a converter and plug which is very costly. should specify on description of item before buying. one very disappointed customer.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with straight hair&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t curl hair at all&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t enough power</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have curly fine hair and it is easy to frizz.  I dry my hair about 80 percent dry then finish it off with the air brush and all of the frizz is gone. I do use a leave in conditioner but even without it my hair looks great. I had the 1 1/2 inch first but it was a little too big of a brush for my hair so I ordered the 1 inch.  Love it. I also had no problem with the control button moving while I do my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy dry hair that I used to drown with conditioners and products to keep it calm. Used ionic dryer also but within a few hours my hair was a mess and nothing other than washing it and soaking on more conditioner helped.  My daughter gave me this airbrush for Christmas and it is a life changer.  I can tame my hair in the morning in less than five minutes and it stays all day. I can go three to five days without washing hair which saves me so much time and makes the color last longer.  And the only product I use now is a small amount of hair serum in between shampoos.  The airbrush works miracles on hair like mine.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful product. It works nice for clean, washed hair but also can fluff up hair as a daily comb out.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy a cheaper copy of this because there is too much metal exposed and easy to get burned.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like it - barrel is too small and it&#x27;s underpowered.  I have fine hair but lots of it and it take too long to dry.  Good for touch ups, but not really a dryer</li>
    <li> I love this air brush.  Much better than the Conair I have for been using for years. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been having issues with frizz on my hair.  I have tried all sorts of hair dryer. This John Frieda hot air brush took the frizz out of my hair and have gotten compliments on how good my hair looks! I have def recommended to others!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing styling tool. I paid 30.00 and it was worth the 30.00!!! I have never received so many compliments on my hair as I have after using this product. It gets a little warm at the barrel, but as long as you don&#x27;t touch it and grip it at the bottom it is very helpful. The prefector is a hundred dollars more and it twirls, but it does not dry your hair as it styles it. So this is a two in one tool. I am so glad I cancled my prefector order and purchased the John Frieda Hot Air Brush. I have short hair and it is perfect. My daughter has long hair and it works beautifully with her hair. It heats very fast and does not burn your head. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. I suggest in order for you to find out if this is for you, you purchase it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair to shoulder length and I&#x27;ve had a time trying to find an air brush that would actually curl my hair at the ends and also give my hair lift at the top.  I have thinning hair (50 yo) in the front and super thick, curly hair in the back.  As you can imagine, it makes for a terrible mess when styling.  Enter this gem after trying 2 others.  I bought the 1&amp;#34; curling brush and I absolutely love what it does for my hair.  It lifts and curls under where I need it, and it straightens enough in the back like I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;cool&#x27; shot is perfect.  Curl your hair with the heat, then set it with the &#x27;cool&#x27;.  This is an ionic brush and I just can&#x27;t believe the difference.  John Frieda has a winner here.  I do wish there was an extension on the end to hold the brush, but I can overlook that as this piece does to my hair what I&#x27;ve always wanted to look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with short hair looking for some body because it&#x27;s thin and fine, look no further.  This is what you need.  Buy the 1&amp;#34; brush.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have natural curley hair and it helps get my roots straight. Even the flat iron I own doesn&#x27;t do as well and I have a very expensive one. I bought this product because it had good reviews and I liked that it had a dryer inside the brush. It&#x27;s dries my hair fast and gives my hair lots of volume. I would recoment it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this hairstyler for my hair, which is fine &amp; thin.  Gives it a lot of body and holds the curl.</li>
    <li> This is an ionizing brush. It would probably be great for long, frizzy hair. It makes my fine hair very flat, but shiny. I am unable to grasp the handle it is so good.</li>
    <li> So much nicer than what I find in the stores these days, and very affordable!</li>
    <li> I have the worst hair, fine and without any body.  Have to get it foiled every 10 weeks to add some body.  Every day is a challenge to get it to look half way decent and about 2 hours later it is flat as if I had not done anything.  Ordered this air brush based on the reviews.  So I did my usual routine which is Redken color shampoo, then Redken spray volumizer at the roots and then Paul Mithchell thicken up.  Flipped my head over and blew my short hair about 80% dry.  Then started with the hot air brush.  I was surprised at how easily the brush goes through without any tangling.  Could not believe the volume, shine and no fly aways!!!  Today I awoke to hair that looks just as good.  As soon as I am finished this review another John Frieda hot air brush is going in my cart.  Can not be without it!</li>
    <li> THIS HOT AIR BRUSH WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND NEEDED.CURLS MY SHORT FUZZY HAIR SO IT&#x27;S NOT KINKY BUT CURLY.I DO WISH JOHN FREIDA MADE THIS HOT AIR IRON IN A 1/2 &amp;#34;. WOULD BE NICE FOR THE SHORTER SIDES.IT GETS HOT SO BE CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THE CYLINDER  OF THE IRON WHEN YOU USE IT.</li>
    <li> I have an older hot air dryer, but thought I would give this one a try. Gives me a nice tight curl in a short time. Really like it. No pulling on my hair, and grabs it well. No bent hair, nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Forget it. Returned because it didn&#x27;t work well at all for me. Clunky and the size was too big.</li>
    <li> Really liked the idea that this air brush was all one piece.  Every other one I have had has been two parts and one of the parts, without fail, has always broken.  It is however a very weak styling tool.  It doesn&#x27;t have the power to dry my hair, and it really doesn&#x27;t do much of a job curling it either.  I have had to revert back to my high powered blow dryer, followed up with a curling iron.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love mine. I have been using it for a couple months. It is light weight and easy to use. My hair is fine and thin and it gives a smooth soft lift.</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly/frizzy hair and this tamed it like nothing else.  I was never able to do the stylists thing of using the roll brush with a blow dryer.  I&#x27;m just not that patient and dexterous.  This is light, the heat level is great and the bristles grab and curl the hair while drying.  I always had a problem with flat frizzy hair after blow drying because I couldn&#x27;t roll the brush around my hair while holding the heavy dryer.  Then I had to use a curling iron to put some curl back.  Because I dried it flat, the curls never stayed even though I have curly hair.  This allows me to have some curl after drying and then to do some touch ups with a curling iron.  Fabulous product.  ...  con:  Yes.. the top gets very hot.  I went to touch it once or twice and learned a lesson.  There are moments when you want to use it like a curling iron but you quickly realize that you don&#x27;t have to hold the top to curl. The brush is so light that one hand can do it all or just hold on to the bottom with both hands and curl the hair that way.</li>
    <li> I used this in the UK and it was great but the US version does not get hot ? So no good im afraid as it just brushes your hair and doesn&#x27;t style it .</li>
    <li> This product has saved my hair. I can&#x27;t style my hair, because it grows in all directions, and is dry and coarse. I can&#x27;t seem to find anyone that can cut my hair half way decent either. I thought I would give this a try, because you don&#x27;t have to use a brush and the blow dryer. It does not get tangled in my hair which is the best feature. It makes my hair smooth and manageable. The only negative thing I have to say about  it is the switch is flat on the handle, and hard to move up and down for me.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I ordered this item. I found the John Frieda JFHA6 Hot Air Brush very bulky and difficult to use. It worked properly but the handle is so big I had a hard time. I returned this item.</li>
    <li> It was great when it worked. I&#x27;ve owned it less than a year and it no longer works properly. Either it doesn&#x27;t come on or I have to twist the wire and hold it a specific way in order for it to work.</li>
    <li> OMG...I HAVE NATURALLY CURLY..FRIZZY HAIR, THIS PRODUCT DOES WONDERS... I ACTUALLY SAW ANOTHER BRAND ON TV FOR A LOT MORE MONEY. DID SOME RESEARCH (AMAZON) AND FOUND THIS HOT AIR BRUSH. SUPER BRUSH AND PRICE</li>
    <li> Best hot air brush on the market and I think I&#x27;ve tried ALL of them. Easy to use, makes you hair soft, silky and beautifully styled.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this Hot Air Brush. I am using a Conair version that is too hot and harms the hair. While this one is gentle, it is too gentle. It does not get hot enough and the bristles seem to promote frizz. The Conair makes my hair smooth, but that miracle comes at a cost of pain to my hand and harm to my hair, which I hate. So I guess I have to keep looking. The brush part of this does not help smooth hair and my hair responded to it with static. That shouldn&#x27;t be happening. I love John Frieda products. I hope they make an improved version.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Ionic does take away some volume, but is very good for frizz such as with a new perm.  Handle is too large for my hand.</li>
    <li> the brush seems to snag my hair</li>
    <li> Great hot air brush for long and short hair.</li>
    <li> I have not had hot hair brush for a long time, but I got it for my mom who was going to stay with us for a month.  It is very nice!  It straightens my hair better than using a brush and hair dryer.  I have slightly wavy hair, so I usually use hair dryer and iron.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product it was much bigger than I thought it would be for my hair. I had to return it and did with them refunding me but paying the return postage sometimes can be a hassle and cost almost as much as the products these days.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed as the brush stopped working only after using it twice. I cannot return it as I am not in US and cannot post it from here....</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m hair styled challenged, the hot air brush has saved the day for me.  Over the years I have gone through my fair share of them.  By far, this one is the best.  I use both sizes since my hair is shorter in the back, than in the front.  I do blow dry my hair upside down for just a short period of time to get the excess wetness out, then I use this hot air brush.  It make my fine hair look like I have lots of body and bounce.  You need to be patience and make sure you complete get your hair dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hot air brush because of the solid manufacture of this item, and it WAS the right thing to do. I like the real bristles and the weight of this...my arms don&#x27;t get so tired. The variations in temperature are convenient and safe for my hair. I felt confident in this particular brand.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for restyling my hair when I haven&#x27;t washed it!  It curls the hair nicely unlike a brush and hair dryer on the second day.</li>
    <li> The brush gives my hair a nice curl, but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  I use this all the time.  If you have long/thick hair like me, you have to get your hair most of the way dry with a regular hair dryer before using this product.  Spray your hair with some sort of detangler or leave in conditioner and the brush slides easily through leaving your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a great hot brush after you had used your hair dryer.  Much better than those with plastic spikes.</li>
    <li> I HAVE REALLY HEAVY STRAIGHT HAIR. IN ORDER TO TRY TO GIVE IT SOME BODY, I MUST HAVE A HOT AIR BRUSH THAT DOES MORE THAN BLOW WARM AIR. I DON&#x27;T HAVE IT FOR VERY LONG BUT EVERY TIME I USE IT, I&#x27;M GLAD I BOUGHT IT.</li>
    <li> I love this Hot Air Brush.  I have long fine hair and this brush actually gives my hair a lift and makes it shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product - it&#x27;s a serious time saver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used a variety of hot air brushes for years. This is my favorite! It dries my hair quickly and the curl remains throughout the day. It also has a 3 year warranty. Love this one!</li>
    <li> Love this styler! I have had the larger version for a few years, cut my hair much shorter and needed this smaller one.  If is all I use when drying/styling my hair.  I keep a spare in case it&#x27;s ever discontinued.  I hope never!</li>
    <li> New to me  I have never had one of these. I am letting my hair grow out and I Love it.  I was asked by several people if I had just had my hair done.  I can manage my hair better and it has volume,  I got this for an early Christmas present from my hubby  Gary.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gary!</li>
    <li> Love how easy to use and the finish products of my hair</li>
    <li> Best for shorter hair, have the 1 1/2 inch, love it too, depends on length of hair. My hair is chin length bob with layers and bangs</li>
    <li> Perfect for quick touch ups or short hair- no problems, however- not extremely hot- which is fine for my use, but it will not do a great job with extremely thick -wet hair.</li>
    <li> Whenever I get a perm and wash my hair I end up with frizz... Not when I use this brush.  Very happy with the way it dries and removes the frizz.</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but then it&#x27;s hard to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to work on my extremely straight and curl resistant hair.  Other than that it works and may be perfect for someone with curly or waivy hair.</li>
    <li> Why am I just now learning about this styling tool?!!!  Saves me a ton of time and is easy to handle. Tempted to buy a back up just in case :)</li>
    <li> It did have a noticeable difference only slightly in how turned on and wet my girl got when having sex!&lt;br /&gt;All in all it made it noticeably better</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great heat , lightweight</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  It would take 30 minutes to dry your hair using this product and I have very short hair..</li>
    <li> Love it, but it is a little bigger around than expected.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try it, having read the good reviews and I figured the good ones outweighed the bad. When I went to plug it in it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. That and I was under the impression the brush head rotated, which it doesn&#x27;t. It was sent back ASAP!</li>
    <li> I admit I was a little skeptical on this one but that was unfounded. Love how it makes my hair feel, love the shine and softness and curl. Looks like a salon dry-out every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Best hot air brush I&#x27;ve used so far. I&#x27;ve tried many others, they just don&#x27;t get hot enough, this heats up fast and works great</li>
    <li> Totally transformed the way I do my hair and how it looks afterwards.  Used a flat iron in the past with fried hair and weird wrinkles from where I applied the iron.  Now my hair is smooth and even and it takes ½ the time to fix it.  I nearly blow my hair dry and then use the hot air brush to finish it up.  Looks so much better --  almost as good as when my stylist blows it out with a round brush and hair dryer.  Very happy with this product and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the brush because it met all the expectations I had.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchase a lot of products from Amazon and never leave reviews.  But this product deserves one.  I&#x27;m a guy with short to medium fine blonde hair but lots of it.  I don&#x27;t need super high heat and tons of air to get the volume necessary for my quiff style hair cut and this product does just the job.  I was very skeptical given that it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of air blowing and it&#x27;s not overly hot but it styles my hair absolutely perfectly.  I use a little volume gel/sea salt spray and then dry &amp; style with this and voila! I have a great head of hair all day.  Highly recommended for this hair type.</li>
    <li> Having fine hair, I look for anything that helps me.  This product is one of them.  Easy to use and my hair finally&lt;br /&gt;looks fuller.  Its great for traveling that I only have to pack the air brush.</li>
    <li> got for a gift, and she loves it, says it works just the way she wanted it... she saw one for $100... was hinting around about that, but really loves this. So, there you are. Always shop around!</li>
    <li> This is the best.  It is perfect for my short hair.  I thought about buying the very expensive units, and so glad I didn&#x27;t.  I will definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wish they made a smaller size!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to make the hair completely smooth, but I love the fullness I get with the brush. Perhaps my hair is not quite long enough yet. I will keep using the brush until I have mastered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth</li>
    <li> This worked great for about 6 or 7 uses.  I bought it the end of June and used it about 5 times before I had to start moving the cord around to make it connect and get it to work.  What a mess to have to keep pushing in on the cord to get power - while trying to curl and dry my hair.  Sure wish it worked because I loved it when it worked.</li>
    <li> I returned this brush. The 1&amp;#34; barrel is a nice size ,but the bristles are too soft and do not grab and hold hair properly.  Also, the tip of the barrel gets very hot so it is  impossible to hold hair over barrel with hand. Not a good product.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering a curling brush and bought this by mistake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the &amp;#34;Profecter&amp;#34;  but this has many of the same components and is very good at curling and straightening the hair into a smooth, delightful style.  This is much less money and very versital</li>
    <li> My fine hair doesn&#x27;t work well even though I bought the smaller size. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I love it so much I bought a second for when it meets it&#x27;s demise, as well as the 1.5 inch. Rough dry your hair first, then use this......... Stunning..</li>
    <li> I love this brush. After your hair is half dry, pull each section of hair up and wound it round the brush for a few seconds. Do this all over your head, My hair looked soft, full, bouncy, and sexy. The guys will touch it and say, Wow, I love your hair! Do it -you&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Great product. I also bought the bigger size also. Will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> This old technology is so much better than all of the new &amp; ineffective products available today. This product works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product in every way.  It gives lots of lift and style to even my very fine, thin, limp hair.  It is very easy to use and well worth the small investment for this styling brush. I love mine so much, I purchased a spare one for the future!!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this tool.  I have extremely fine, thinning hair so I get pretty stressed out when blow drying my hair with a hair dryer and round brush.  Using this tool has saved my hair. My hair glides right through and I don&#x27;t even need to straighten my hair after.  I also feel like it&#x27;s a much calmer hair dryer experience, no more trying to balance different tools and super loud hair dryers (I use this on low so it&#x27;s not too loud).  Also traveling has been a breeze, this takes up much less  space than a round brush and hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I wish it came with some kind of travel protector, but I just pack it so it won&#x27;t get crushed.</li>
    <li> Overall the hot air brush works nicely but the handle has a very large barrel making it cumbersome to grip and angle properly.</li>
    <li> I am sure this will work for some, but it is not good for me and my short hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush!  The smaller barrel is perfect for my short hair and it dries quickly.  I like the fact that it has both regular bristles and some with small knob tips for holding the hair.  It also gives your hair a nice shine.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hot air brush.  Works great on my fine hair.  Only takes a few seconds for it to warm up and just a few minutes later, my hair is done.  Unlike others, in my opinion the brush does get hot enough - at least my fingers say it does!  The brush itself is not stiff, but not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t catch my hair.  Like I said, I have fine straight hair and have no problems getting my hair around the brush, nor have I had any problems with my hair getting caught and tangled in it.  The brush also has a setting for cool air which is easy to use - you just slide the control from the low or high position - you don&#x27;t even have to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of the gals who is lucky enough NOT to have fine straight hair, you probably don&#x27;t understand the problem of finding a brush that will grasp the hair to begin with.  My hair is so straight that scrunches (sorry, spelling) would not stay in - the same thing with a band or a barrette.  I am completely satisfied with this air brush and the way it works with my hair.</li>
    <li> Good for short -hair. Easy to loose the bristle of hairbrush. But good for damaged hair become shiny hair caused by effective of ionic treatment.</li>
    <li> Had purchased the somewhat larger one and then got this one.  Work well without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  burnt my hands and the brittles became too soft to do any good.</li>
    <li> I use it after my hair is all dry. So easy to use. Usually use a brush and dryer but this is a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Works great for styling and drying.  Handy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Just enough heat to dry without frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending this to my friends</li>
    <li> I like the smaller 1 inch barrel. The turn on switch is difficult to use, and I have small hands. It&#x27;s flat against the handle, and I have to use my fingernail to turn it on off, etc. Also, I was hoping for stiffer bristles, these soft ones really don&#x27;t help with the hot air styling. Wish I could find one with higher watts, 500 just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> What a great tool!  I&#x27;m clumsy as heck and just can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of using a blow dryer + brush to get a flip in my hair and this tool takes care of that. The bristles grab a hunk of my hair and I can easily roll it up onto the barrel.  I was worried that this Hot Air Brush wouldn&#x27;t release my hair easily, but it does.  My hair has never gotten stuck on the barrel and I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months or so now. (My hair is shoulder length, and is fine and thick.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that if I follow the directions, this Hot Air Brush works even better, go figure.  I started by using the high setting for everything, thinking higher&#x3D;better.  What I found is that high speed works great for getting excess moisture out of my hair quickly, then when my hair is almost dry I switch to the low setting to style my hair.  To me it seems to style better, easier and with no frizz using the low setting.  Others may have a different experience, but that&#x27;s what works best on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool has been a great find for me and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Hold and twirl by top of brush in one palm and base of handle in other palm. Did not have issue with switch being turned off as one user mentioned as I hold at the base in the palm of my hand. Grabs and releases my short hair easily, but could see how longer hair might be more likely to tangle on the brush. Agree should use with slightly damp hair as instructions advise. Not meant to dry very wet hair quickly. For me, this is much easier than using a brush and hair dryer together to get a soft lift and curl.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair that dries quickly. This brush dryer is amazing, not only does it dry my hair it smooths and styles it at the sane time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terrible with a hair dryer and round brush. This is a perfect solution! My hair is thick and fine. This gives it a lot of body and just enough wave to make it look great without it looking &#x27;done&#x27;. I let my hair air dry for about 20 - 30 min and take this to it (my hair dries in about 2 hours if I let it air dry by itself). I&#x27;m done with the styling in 5-10 minutes, depending on what I&#x27;m going for.</li>
    <li> This does a wonderful job of smoothing and styling my hair. It takes less time than a brush and regular blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brush and it is everything she hoped it would be.  The 1 inch barrel iw just the right size for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product the end of May and it had burned out by the end of July.  I liked it while it worked, but that was short-lived.  I really don&#x27;t recommend this product and am now looking for a new hot air brush.</li>
    <li> Quick &amp; Easy... love it I use it daily my hair is short and I&#x27;m done in no time.&lt;br /&gt;I must add that my sister has really long hair and it didn&#x27;t as well and it took longer then just having a blow dryer and a large brush.</li>
    <li> Like the ease of use. Need damp not wet hair to get best affect.  Good loose curls for a smooth look.</li>
    <li> Love this airbrush....easy to use....no tangles....I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Did not work for short hair - barrel too large.</li>
    <li> Just love this hair tool!  My wavy, thinning hair has soooo much more body now.  I apply a root booster then a couple of drops of hair serum to the ends, blow dry my hair upside down to about 90%, , then finish up by using the hot air brush.  Although the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; function is a pain to use on this brush, it really does help to keep the curls standing up.  I then ruffle in a tiny bit of Kevin Murphys Night.Rider, push and pull gently, and I have a shiny, unstructured look.  All that is required to regroom my hair during the day is to quickly toss it around a bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very convenient and perfect to make my hair style. My hair length is just longer than my shoulder. I can make curls naturally with this 1 inch size.</li>
