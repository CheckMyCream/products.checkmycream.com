      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me, but to each his/her own.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I want to leave room for my own error.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use around mouth unless you are applying for a photo session (and it works great if you don&#x27;t move, smile or even talk a lot).  </li>
      <li>But i dare u to smile after lol</li>
      <li>Although the bags under my own eyes had a smidge of improvement, I was hoping more than seeing more.</li>
      <li>It was too good to be true and now I am paying the price.  </li>
      <li>Was impressed at first then realised that once you smile, the puffiness under the eyes and crows feet reappear.</li>
      <li>I also found it ineffective if I tried to apply makeup under it, or on top of it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure of what I saw.</li>
      <li>WAS HOPING FOR BETTER RESULTS</li>
      <li>I was told to apply concealer or foundation on top of it, but I don&#x27;t use either of those.</li>
      <li>Love this, but I agree that it leaves a flaky finish, so try this put a drop of  your favorite moisturizing cream or oil and blend</li>
      <li>I LOVE the face serum, but this stuff is something else all together.  </li>
      <li>Also, if you put any concealer or foundation on top of it, of course it takes this product off -</li>
      <li>absolutely love it...</li>
      <li>I would agree with the most of the posts on here.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d still buy more</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>are so pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Is it better?</li>
      <li>but I thought could be better</li>
      <li>Thus product needs a better description.  </li>
      <li>I really really love it</li>
      <li>Love love love this product</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do the magic I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>It worked ok.</li>
      <li>are so pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>Then as more minutes  </li>
      <li>like it states, it probably lasts an hour 2 at the most...</li>
      <li>The more often you use, the better you look.  </li>
      <li>Interesting they are trying to sell this as multi-level marketing.  </li>
      <li>So pleased I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune.</li>
      <li>Sure, if I sit still like a mannequin I look great, but i&#x27;m a smiler and a laugher and have many facial expressions, so I got up, looked in the mirror and smiled.</li>
      <li>Removes all the puffiness for sure, and acts very quickly just like in the videos.</li>
      <li>More than just works, it does so incredibly fast and exceptionally</li>
      <li>Just make sure you apply LIGHTLY</li>
      <li>Not the best you can&#x27;t wear this with make up as it pretty much wipes it all and leaves white clay like marks and if you wear it under makeup when you apply makeup it shows lines so unless you just want to look great going to bed</li>
      <li>Making sure it evenly spread is important.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well, I am going to give it a little better review than the others have.  Only use it on the UNDER EYE AREA.  That is where it works best.  Even if you put it on the sides of the eyes in the wrinkle area, the wrinkles do tend to come back the more you move that area.  But the under eye area doesn&#x27;t move as much and so I have found that it does last much longer in that area.  Don&#x27;t use around mouth unless you are applying for a photo session (and it works great if you don&#x27;t move, smile or even talk a lot).  Those wrinkles do come back quicker as well.  At $14.00 for 2 tubes, or even $50 for an entire box, it is NOT expensive.  Just think about all the money you have spent on various wrinkle removers and NONE of them worked...at all.  This does work, and very well under the eye (the dark areas or &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;).  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Does not work and gets flaky.</li>
    <li> I spent roughly £26/£27 on an easter drop down price for this product,had a shower and washed my hair anxiously antisipating a miracle when I put the cream on my eyes nowin a video I watched with a lady from America using this cream it was coloured white but when I opened the vile I bought it&#x27;s a peachy colour,it went on easily enough and I sat watching and waiting and waiting and waiting for the miracle it claims to happen but it didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s left a dry,flaky esidue on my eyes and makes them look dry,when you touch your skin it comes off at the slightest touch in flaky pieces...soo dissapointed and won&#x27;t be wasting my money again,I can&#x27;t believe there charging €99 for 10 vilest of this stuff..really! I could have added £40 more for both injections that would have lasted me 6 months!...thanx for nothing instantly ageless :(</li>
    <li> This product is ok but not what I expected to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t last for 8-10hrs like it states, it probably lasts an hour 2 at the most... With the cost of the product plus postage and packaging then having to pay a customs charge it cost me over £200 not worth the money when it only lasts a couple of hours. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you can get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product did absolutely NOTHING......I had to return it.  Was really hoping it would have had some&lt;br /&gt;benefits.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a temporary fix.  It turns white do you&lt;br /&gt;Have to put makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a night out.</li>
    <li> Zero stars! I bought this product after seeing amazing videos on Facebook. I paid a small fortune for it and it is a complete waste of money. It works amazingly...I&#x27;m 37 years old and it took 10 years off instantly. However; if you smile, laugh, or make any facial expressions at all it cracks, which added about 10 years to my age. I say stick to the clinically proven products that offer a money back guarantee, because this product is not and does not.</li>
    <li> Thus product needs a better description.  Did not realize there was a tint.  Very pale and does not dry clear.  Leaves pale flecks on your skin.  Looks awful.</li>
    <li> There is no magic, but it does its work.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to report that this product disappointed. It may have made a slight difference, but dried out skin under my eyes leaving me with a worse look.  How do I return product for refund?&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate your help with this return&lt;br /&gt;Thank you;&lt;br /&gt;Teri Lara&lt;br /&gt;562.708.2398</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t  work. Just  made my face tight, and sticky.</li>
    <li> This product does fill in fine lines. However it flakes whether you put it on light or heavy. So you walk around with white stuff all over your face. Not a product I will purchase again. Now I have a whole box of them and hate this product.  Worse purchase ever.</li>
    <li> I love this quick fix.  Obviously as the day goes on it is less effective but I base my review on the fact that my husband commented how much better I looked.  This is a man who normally wouldn&#x27;t notice if I left the house naked so this is the biggest endorsement I can give this product.</li>
    <li> It works like they said it would.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Horrible absolutely useless very disappointed</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected.I found that when you first apply it to your under eye area,and it dries, it does seem to diminish dark circles and wrinkles but as soon as you make any kind of expression with your face such as smiling, it creates more wrinkles under your eyes. To me the stuff feels like applying glue to your face. Also it is impossible to apply makeup on top of this product. I will not be purchasing Instantly Ageless OMG! ever again its a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to determine what a small amount is; I either end up with too little or too much.  It also burns and callouses my skin if I use it on bare skin, so I use it over my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work pretty well, although it feels like there is glue on your eyes.  I still use it occasionally, but it is not what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> The product is very stiff when it dries.  You are feeling that stiffness all day.  You have to get the right amount on or it is flaky.  Not quite as good as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Nothing more thAn a tightening of the skin for a few hours and leaves a white dry  goo under the eyes  on a man</li>
    <li> This product is quite amazing. Instantly removes wrinkles around eyes. Fast shipping. Great service. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Useless and a waste of money. Any facial expression or movement and the wrinkles appear. Leaves a sticky white residue. Useful perhaps immediately prior to a photo shoot, thats about it.</li>
    <li> product was horrible. They should be ashamed of ripping people off</li>
    <li> Does not work dry out face</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> If I could give no star I would! This is a terrible product. When the cream dries it&#x27;s like having Elmer&#x27;s glue on your skin. As soon as you smile you can see numerous added creases highlighted by the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> did not work like i wish for</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  You need to have major major bags AND wrinkles for this to work. It&#x27;s like Elmer&#x27;s Glue....it will harden up and straighten loose skin.  Once it gets wet it will let loose.  Also does leave chalky, flaky, residue behind.  Can&#x27;t use make up really either.</li>
    <li> Just as another reviewer said, this is like Sudden Change. I tried SC many years ago, and yes, it dries and smoothes out the undereye bags, but don&#x27;t you dare smile or move too many facial muscles.....or else. Well, same with this product! My face was very stiff and I was afraid to talk or smile b/c I knew it would show cracks where the product was applied. If you apply a tiny amount it won&#x27;t smooth and flatten the bags, so you have to apply more. Well, when you do that, it leaves a white residue.  I was told to apply concealer or foundation on top of it, but I don&#x27;t use either of those. Only product on my face will be my daily moisturizer and this. Sure, if I sit still like a mannequin I look great, but i&#x27;m a smiler and a laugher and have many facial expressions, so I got up, looked in the mirror and smiled. Please!!! I looked worse! No I didn&#x27;t have bags, but now I had creases and lines under my eye which I don&#x27;t have normally, only the undereye bags. So yes, it&#x27;s just like Sudden Change, but much more expensive. Also, if you put any concealer or foundation on top of it, of course it takes this product off - you&#x27;re putting liquid on top of dried liquid. If you use powder, you&#x27;re putting powder on top of white residue. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me, but to each his/her own.</li>
    <li> It works but if you put makeup over it it stops working.</li>
    <li> Am not finding it to work, what am I doing wrong?</li>
    <li> I found that in the first few days I could see a difference but in the days afterwards, it seem like the lower part underneath the eye became more saggy. I would really like to return it for a full refund if I had the information to do that.</li>
    <li> hasnt worked on the areas i needed it to work</li>
    <li> SOME A BIT DRY PUTTING ON AND CRUMBLES OFF,  BUT THE CREAMIER ONES SEEM TO WORK GREAT</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money if you wear coverup. It works great if you don&#x27;t. Once you apply coverup the effects go away. I&#x27;ve also tried it on top of coverup, what a mess. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It worked ok. My face felt dry and when I smiled it felt like it was going to crack.</li>
    <li> Not at all impressed.</li>
    <li> Works for about 3 minutes.  It could be great if it didn&#x27;t leave a white residue behind.  So disappointed in this product.  Do Not waste your money.</li>
    <li> The skin where the product was used did become firm and tight instantly, but it was very shiny almost like dried superglue, and it was very obvious that the product was being used.  Also, if you need to wet the area after, the product was instantly wiped away and the wrinkles reappeared.</li>
    <li> The product makes the skin under my eyes feel dry and weird feeling.</li>
    <li> The first application, I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.  Took 10 years off of my face.  The second time, when I removed it, the area around my eyes was bright red.  I thought it would be okay in the morning, but the circles around my eyes were so accentuated and there were wrinkles where there were not previously.  I LOOK ABOUT 15 YEARS OLDER!  I am really upset about this......  It was too good to be true and now I am paying the price.  Don&#x27;t try it--it&#x27;s dangerous.</li>
    <li> Product looked good for first hour then dried and flakey.</li>
    <li> sorry waste of money didnt like it .</li>
    <li> Love this, but I agree that it leaves a flaky finish, so try this put a drop of  your favorite moisturizing cream or oil and blend in let it dry, use a loose powder over the area, nothing with talc, (I use nueutragena) liquid makeup does  not work well.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does exactly what it claims to do. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly don&#x27;t leave the house with out using it♡</li>
    <li> It does work, but I found it difficult to put make up on on top of it, but as I said I could see a change, I&#x27;m going to keep trying to find a way of getting make up on on top of it.</li>
    <li> Was sadly disappointed!</li>
    <li> Not the best you can&#x27;t wear this with make up as it pretty much wipes it all and leaves white clay like marks and if you wear it under makeup when you apply makeup it shows lines so unless you just want to look great going to bed it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
    <li> I would never purchase this product again, it is a waste of money. It dries and draws your skin like an egg white does. It does not work at all like the video that I watched. I am very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Not at all like botox!</li>
    <li> Omg the most amazing cream ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Its ok but not worth the money</li>
    <li> Great product-use a very small amount or you&#x27;ll  see a dry film.</li>
    <li> Was impressed at first then realised that once you smile, the puffiness under the eyes and crows feet reappear. Was really disappointed that there was no money back guarantee if not entirely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Defiantly a tube full of whipped egg white.  Save your money try whipped egg white its amazingly identical and probably better for your skin.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Dried WHITE (literally the color WHITE) and is flaky.  Returning it.....and I have to pay return postage! Also, I have to pay for the two vials I opened.  The first one was bad, so I opened anther in hopes it was a fluke.  This is a scam.  Only giving one star because I have to choose a star rating.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do the magic I thought it would.  Left crustiness you can see and makeup and moisturizer over it or under it makes crustiness look worse!  Like someone else mentioned, it simply creates artificial wrinkles!  Under my eyes looked TERRIBLE!  I honestly get better results just washing my face and applying my usual moisturizer and no makeup!  I tried the derma&#x27;needle thingy and actually got great results from just two times, but it does take a few months to really see the difference.  I stopped because it was so painful to do, because I don&#x27;t play, I really press hard, bleed, and do all the angles suggested.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to it, even if it does take me two days to heal!  I ordered some numbing cream so hoping that helps with the pain.  Check that dermaroller thingy out...it takes a long time but you&#x27;ll be happy in the long run (not for major wrinkles, I don&#x27;t think, tho...but certainly wouldn&#x27;t hurt to research it - I&#x27;m 43 with fairly light wrinkling, no crows feet or anything like that yet).  Good luck!</li>
    <li> This has exceeded all my expectations! This works wonderfully!! I LIVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Awful product. Leaves a horrid crusty residue on the skin... Like sand stuck to your skin. It does not last the length of time it said its supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> It dries and cracks like a face mask, it looks terrible so ended up washing it off.  Wasted my money I guess. So pleased I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it tightens put you end up with millions of tiny cracks.</li>
    <li> It worked like it said it would, but felt like super glue around my eyes.  BTW.. you can&#x27;t wear mositurizer or it won&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> it leaves a white film on the face, and not as effective as I imagined</li>
    <li> Prep H in a vial.. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> This works very well, however you can see a difference in your makeup where you applied the product.</li>
    <li> It really is a miracle. Awesome</li>
    <li> It is rapid, effective but short lived</li>
    <li> Product makes under your eyes when you smile look worse. I found the tightening and loosening when you take it off has made the elasticity far worse then before I started. I would not recommend. it&#x27;s a gimmick.</li>
    <li> I love it! It smooths out my fine lines &amp; gets rid of the bags &amp; dark circles under my eyes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s stufs. She likes.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly at a reasonable price.  It works just like the videos show.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 25 resealable vials. I had tried the product, a vial from my friend AND I loved it. BUT what I RECEIVED  was 50 foil packets that you cannot reseal, NOT happy with these, They are thick and dry out immediately LIKE INSTANTLY. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Just awesome!! I have dark circles under my eyes all my life.... I&#x27;m 55 years old!! As soon as I put it on its like magic!!! You can literally watch them disappear!!</li>
    <li> Application can be tricky to get the right amount.  Once you do, you wont want to leave the house without it.  Smoothes wrinkles till you wash your face again. Might even help to prevent deeper wrinkles  Watch the product video on their website to see for yourself.  Helpful hint... I break a q-tip in half and use it as a stopper to prevent drying out, since I don&#x27;t want to waste any.</li>
    <li> I did not receive vials.  I received 50 individual hard to open packets!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy leaves a horrible residue on skin waste of money  wish I never bothered invest in a good eye cream instead</li>
    <li> In just seconds my eye wrinkles disappear.  It is a miracle.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on me or my daughter..</li>
    <li> I only use this immediately and directly under my eyes on the crepey part; just a very thin line. Just under the lower lashes.  It pulls up the skin under the eyes and I am quite happy with it.  Tried it farther down the eye and it did not work well.  So I just use it where it works and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I saw almost no difference at all; and any difference I did see disappeared within an hour.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you apply LIGHTLY or you will have white dried lotion spots.&lt;br /&gt;Works on areas other than your eyes!</li>
    <li> I liked it but when you put on foundation it was all dry looking</li>
    <li> WAS HOPING FOR BETTER RESULTS</li>
    <li> Totally worthless, does not work, don&#x27;t believe the video, it is fake. I fell for it. Sorry ladies it is not the answer we are all looking for.</li>
    <li> After a hour or so it starts caking around the eyes. Tried various amounts still get the same results.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product I read reviews and all seemed to be negative but I have yet to experience any of the bad reviews....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it... I blend my vials inmoisturizer and works for me...</li>
    <li> I was recently approached to review this product for free, by a consultant for Instantly Ageless serum by Jeunesse. I, approaching my 30’s in the next couple of years, decided that it couldn’t hurt to demo a product that is supposed to work within just a few minutes of using it. Yeah, right- right?&lt;br /&gt;Instantly ageless is a microcream that uses peptides to basically give a lady some botox without all of the gross needles. Botox, in cream form? Again, yeah right. I figured, with such seemingly outlandish claims, the worst case scenario would be that I got to write a scathing review about marketing towards the hopeless feeling we all have about in regards to our age lines. The best case scenario would be that my dark circles faded a bit, making me look less like a corpse and more like a very tired blood transfusion patient. I had high hopes people, high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;‘Lo and behold, I’ve been pleasantly surprised absolutely freakin’ blown away by this stuff! Holy crappola it actually works! More than just works, it does so incredibly fast and exceptionally well.&lt;br /&gt;Within seconds of using the cream, I could feel it start tightening and changing my eye contour. It’s not pleasant, with a stretching sensation that does not hurt but is noticeable enough that I wondered whether or not I would have to deal with it all day. It does fade within a few minutes, although the results last 8+ hours. Only a tiny amount is required to get the job done but do make sure that enough is applied for adequate coverage, or else the spots that were missed end up looking more dramatic when the rest of the area is wrinkle-free.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t take a good picture of my eyeball so I used my mother’s. These are not retouched to make the effects more dramatic. I’m not that talented in the photo editing department, believe me. These were taken with the same model, on the same couch, in front of the same window and on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t even believe the results. The picture was taken almost immediately after application and you can see that the cream is actually still wet underneath her eye. The results became more dramatic about two minutes after this, only my toddler was desperate to have her hair braided and wouldn’t let up about it so the light was not as good for the second round of pictures. Still, I assume you can see the difference between the two eyes- and what a difference it was!almost immediately after application and you can see that the cream is actually still wet underneath her eye.

    <li> This product is amazing!!!  It took 15 years off of my age!!!  I am hooked for life!!!!</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference within minutes. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent swift service</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a scam. It really does work. Especially on the skin around your eyes.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. Once it dried the extra skin bunched up in big rolls. Applying makup over it made it worst.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, not sure what the lady in the video used because several of us tried it and nothing. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not that great.  It does do a fairly good job at what it says and got rid of my puffiness/dark circles but it was very &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had more of an expectation from it, it leaves a kind of a wiff behind on the face&lt;br /&gt;But it works and Makes the face more tight.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time!  Interesting they are trying to sell this as multi-level marketing.  I received the product from a distributor.  Truly I was amazed by the videos, however at 48 and having mild crinkling under my eyes this product did ZERO.  It was crusty and that was it.  These MLM people are &amp;#34;selling&amp;#34; the company videos to SELL this product, but challenge one of them to show you live time and you will get NADA--except a video!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work fairly well</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of my money. This product cakes and cracks after it dries and really looked horrible once makeup is applied. Total disappointment to me.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed.</li>
    <li> Better than a face lift!</li>
    <li> It does not have the same effect on me as what the demo video did on the model.  Products had been on the shelf for quiet sometime I guess even though the expiration may be closed to May 2016, and it is less than a year.  The cream is thick and lumpy and I did not feel any change or improvement to my eye bag.  I am not sure if it is the product is too old or if it is just not working!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a womans product! When you sweat or wipe your face it comes off. I thought it absorbed into your skin. I wish I had known this before my purchase.</li>
    <li> It works, however it&#x27;s not the instantly ageless that I saw advertised in a white box. This one came in a black box is called instantly ageless wow.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Just bought my second box.</li>
    <li> I am sending it back!  Ordered 25 vials and got 100 sachets instead. Tried it one time.  It worked alright but one it dried all around where I had applied it looked like I got into plumbers puddy.  It was awful, I had to wash my face to get all that dried up stuff off . Should of known it was to good to be true :(</li>
    <li> The product drys your face out and makes your face white with dry spots. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various skin tightening products under my eyes (for bags) for years, but I am definitely a convert to Instantly Ageless!  OMG!  I just put it on, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  As with most tighteners, less is more!  That&#x27;s definitely the key to success with this product.  Love it, love it, love it!!!  Definitely earned my 5 stars...and I&#x27;m 69!  If it works for me, it&#x27;ll work for you!</li>
    <li> Not that good like i aspect</li>
    <li> I was looking into buying this but wanted to check out the &amp;#34;REAL CUSTOMER reviews. ..not the ones the company pays for. Thank you all for your honest reviews,  good or bad. Especially LOVE Kiki &#x27; s review. ...omg she had me ROLLING from laughing so hard. ..it was well worth the time it took to look this product up! You missed your calling if you aren&#x27;t a comedy writer already!</li>
    <li> I like the product, but not inlove.  I have noticed I don&#x27;t really get all the puffiness away when I use under the eye.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it underneath my eyes and I look years younger. Only need very little at a tie.I use it after makeup.</li>
    <li> Bought the bottle and then bought these.  They work pretty well as these kind of products go but I think next time I would just purchase the bottle.  Easier to use.</li>
    <li> does nog help as was promissed...</li>
    <li> Love it!!  This was my second box.......wouldn&#x27;t spend the money if it didn&#x27;t work!  For best results, use with mineral powder make-up instead of a liquid. It seems to work better this way!!</li>
    <li> Works exactly like it showed in the videos I reviewed on YouTube. I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Heres the thing! I originally asked a local distributor if this is anything like sudden change? That product also tightens skin and leaves residue behind nit to mention when u smile u have more wrinkles then originally have!!! So the distributor said no its different! I bought a sample to try! My opinion it is the same as sudden change! Infact back in the 60&#x27;s my mom used to use sudden change when it first came out! At that time they mixed foundation with it and it worked quite well! So my review here is yes instantly ageless does diminish circles and tightens them! But have any of them models smiled hard or jusr smile in general after? No u barely see any that do, due to it causes more wrinkles to form, wrinkles u don&#x27;t even have!!! Scientifically that extra skin has to go somewhere,granted its  under the cream and dries stiff on your face. If u let the product dry as u are not smiling it looks all tight and tauht! But i dare u to smile after lol u will have a face full of artificial wrinkles!!! Again this is what i assumed waa going to happen!!! I tried putting face cream on my eye bags just a tad to maybe loosen the dreadful artificial wrinkles and if anything all that did was take off the instantly ageless! So not trying to down such a liked product, im just simply stating my facts and trial! So im really not sold on this! Glad i didnt buy the whole set! Again it may wirk well fir others but once u smile Boom all these new wrinkles appear !</li>
    <li> This product is a lie!  I received it in a timely manner.  However, it appears to be old, and when I put it on under my eyes, it turns bright yellow.  Very rarely am I disappointed with my purchases, but this time it is horrible!</li>
    <li> A lot of money and no results from product. Disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> Works when you first put it on but don&#x27;t get to excited because once you start moving your face around the results are gone and your face actually looks worse then before you applied it.  Total waste of money.  All the videos of the product are done by reps who sell the produce.  Shame on them.  This is a scam.  And they don&#x27;t have a money back warranty.  If I could return it, I would.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this cream.......I dont want to wash it off!  It really is amazing the results it has on my bags under my eyes. Just wondering if I can use it all over my body?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it a higher rating if it wasn&#x27;t caky.&lt;br /&gt;It works.  I&#x27;d still buy more</li>
    <li> Only used it twice but working well so far</li>
    <li> I just ordered this i cant wait I am so excited</li>
    <li> Works but often has to be applied twice to work.  Why?</li>
    <li> Love love love this product</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> Works as promised but looks a bit crackled when dry.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it Zero stars.  Makes your skin white as a ghost, nasty residue and why is it gritty?  soradiantskincare.com is where it&#x27;s at, their Instant Repair Gel is everything this claims to be and much more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference !</li>
    <li> I loved it!! It took several tries to figure it out, but it does work. I got a sample from this site free2minutefaceliftsample dot com then I ordered the box.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time and great product</li>
    <li> It works great but leaves a grainy, white film. It can be covered with foundation but still doesn&#x27;t look smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING don&#x27;t use too much. The only problem with it is that I want to look like that permanently because I look smoothed out and younger looking. I really really love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the result</li>
    <li> Not impress at all!  Not easy to apply and leaves white residue behind.  I guess if you want to use for a special occasion and have a lot  of patience... It may work.  I would rather to invest on facial treatments and a great anti-wrinkle eye product than try to camouflage with something else.</li>
    <li> Wow!  How disappointing!!  Feels like a bit of egg white drying in your eye. Didn&#x27;t shrink any thing..left a crust as another Customer said,  what a waste if $70.00. Don&#x27;t do it!!!!!  Also, order came with no paper work for me to return!!!  Just wrong.  Buyer be ware</li>
    <li> leaves dark marks when it dries; seemed to make my face look worse.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. I have noticed a difference even when I wake up the next day. It gives dramatic instant results and over time results. I am also using the moisturizer. I highly recommend them both! If you get a white film you are using too much. It does take a few applications to know just the right amount to use.</li>
    <li> omg  you would not believe how well this product works.  alternative for those who do not wish surgery, and have a few deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I would agree with the most of the posts on here. I&#x27;m torn...it does work but when it dries it can flake up and turn white. It is almost impossible to put foundation over it because it seems to magnify the areas you don&#x27;t use the cream on which is a terrible contrast to have on the face. Also, something weird happened...when I applied it to the frown lines in between my eyebrows I LITERALLY saw my skin move-almost bubble or like something was moving under my skin. It shocked me for a minute and I thought I was seeing things but I&#x27;m sure of what I saw. The reason I rated this 3 stars and not 1 or 2 is because I have found, for me, the best place to put this is on my forehead which takes away my frown lines and makes me look a lot less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t like it under my eyes, in fact the next day it seemed as though my dark circles were emphasized even more and it seems to dry the skin out. That was only my first application so I have to wonder if I put too much on which left the residue. I&#x27;m going to try it again and see if the results are different. I figure $5 for a vial isn&#x27;t a great loss if I do run into the same problems.  UP DATE I&#x27;ve used it again, a few times, and have tried various ways of applying. But it all ended in the same result... NO. It really does seem to cause more wrinkles, especially the next day, and dry your skin out terribly. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you put a little amount on in a few areas or on most of your face, it just does weird things to your skin. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Well, there&#x27;s $60 down the pooper! I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I want to leave room for my own error. I know a lot of folks have complained of a cakey or pastey feeling after using it. I figured that maybe that was because they used too much, since the video says to not use a lot. I was willing to try it. I&#x27;ve only used it once, at this point, but I can say that I didnt use too much. I put a small dab on my ring finger, spread it to my other ring finger, then lightly dabbed and rubbed it around my under eye area, where I have some trouble. I felt a little stickiness, at first, as I was spreading it in. That tipped me off to what others were talking about. However, after thoroughly spreading it on, my skin felt really soft.  And that was it.  Absolutely ZERO change. I read and re-read the instructions. I even added a little more and waited for it to dry. No caking, but nothing remotely resembling any kind of lift or tightening, at all. I dont know what was going on in that video that got everybody so excited, but it had to be special effects. I&#x27;ve got areas of concern [under eye], but they&#x27;re not extreme. If there was even a tiny benefit to this product, I should have seen SOMETHING! I&#x27;ll keep trying, and if it turns out to be my error, I&#x27;ll come back and write a more positive review.</li>
    <li> I think there comes a point in your life when you have to give up the dream. If you need a bookmark to find your necklace then you&#x27;ve exceeded the &amp;#34;delicate folds&amp;#34; phase and moved on to full-on old. It happens. It&#x27;s life. There are no miracles in a tube unless Trump sells off his sperm and you manage to birth an heir, then it won&#x27;t matter, you&#x27;ll be set for life. The odds of that happening are about as good as this stuff erasing the bags under your eyes for any extended period of time. When first applied you can&#x27;t help but feel the rush of excitement as you count each long second of time before it dries on your face. Is it better? Hard to tell because once it dries and you apply concealer to cover the unfortunate dark circles under your eyes you had in the first place, you wipe off the product and you&#x27;re back to square one. If you don&#x27;t need to cover the results with makeup, be warned, it only lasts for about 7 hours, so if you&#x27;re on a hot date and wind up spending the night, you better leave before sun up or your partner will think he went home with a Shar Pei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is tiny as if you&#x27;ve been sent a Tiffany bracelet in a white box of hope. I used my 84 year old vain mother as the template for the application. Her vision is marred due to her recent development of cataracts so I figured she&#x27;d be happy with any results I told her. I tried it on both of us at the same time and as we collectively held our breaths for the cream to freeze and lift the bags under our eyes, the results actually happened for her.  Seriously, she looks 15 years younger. It was amazing. Perhaps the older you are the better it works. Although the bags under my own eyes had a smidge of improvement, I was hoping more than seeing more. It&#x27;s like marrying a guy with so many red flags, you think you&#x27;re in a parade, instead of stranded at the freak show. But hey, I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars, because my mother and her third husband (who&#x27;s negativity is only surpassed by his small mindedness) are so pleased with the results, they&#x27;ve decided to take a vacation. And whenever they leave town, it&#x27;s a vacation for me as well.) are so pleased with the results, they&#x27;ve decided to take a vacation. And whenever they leave town, it&#x27;s a vacation for me as well.</li>
    <li> I put this on as directed. But after applying other make up it no longer worked. Think it would be good for men or a women that does no wear makeup.</li>
    <li> I did  not receive the vials as pictured.  I received &amp;#34;sample like&amp;#34; rip-open mini pouches.  I&#x27;m not sold on this product.  I LOVE the face serum, but this stuff is something else all together.  It&#x27;s very tacky and difficult to apply.  You have to pat and pat and pat and pat.  You also can NOT make any facial expressions when you are applying this product.  No moisturizer before or after and certainly no liquid type of concealer, or the instantly ageless will just come off.  I see where it tightens the puffy bags, but nothing for the dark circles.  I truly do not believe that I would ever purchase this product again.  MAYBE I am doing something wrong.....if so, PLEASE tell me.  I WANT to really like Instantly Ageless.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing,use it almost daily,love it!</li>
    <li> Did not produce the results expected.  Only a slight reduction in under eye circles.</li>
    <li> The video shows the product being applied, making it look like it is something other than a concealing makeup.</li>
    <li> Ok all you ladies out there that have tried to find something that actually does what it says it will do?  THIS IS IT !!!  I am 62 and have spent tons of money on something to &#x27;plump&#x27; all those tiny wrinkles under my eyes.  You can actually sit and watch this work !!!  It is totally amazing !</li>
    <li> It works well to tighten. Application is tricky. The bad part about it, is you cannot apply any moisturizer or Foundation either before or after. It won&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on something that doesn&#x27;t work. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ladies, wonderful product that truly is face lift in a tube!! Highly recommend.. Really like the new packaging!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> didnt like it.. when trying to put on make up it rubs off and skin goes back the way it was. will not recommend to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product... Instead buy indeed nanoblur , it&#x27;s around £15.00 from boots for a 30 ml tube which will last for about 9 months used every day. It does exactly the same as this product if not better. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue , and it can be used with moisturiser and foundation. Nanoblur is worth every penny I just love it and wouldn&#x27;t be with out it.</li>
    <li> Does work...for about an hour :-(</li>
    <li> Ordering and receiving the product went well, however I am not impressed with the product.  Basically, once you put any makeup on top of it, the wrinkles are more obvious than they were without it.</li>
    <li> Instantly ageless is amazing! The other day I used it and someone thought I was 8 years younger than my age. I&#x27;m 39. It makes me feel young again. After countless disappointments it&#x27;s so nice to have a product do what it says it will do</li>
    <li> Omg, this product works instantly! I watched some videos for application steps. It took me several times before I found the right amount to use to perfect my look. At times, a white residue may be visible, but it can be blended with lotion or water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ticked one but really it should be half chalky feeling and wears off very quickly a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Omg really great my brother bought half of them off me!</li>
    <li> not sure about this product, need to use it for a longer period of time before making a final decision as to its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> It might work better for white people, i am a black woman and my skin is medium brown, when I apply the product as directed it shows up white under my eyes after a few minutes. Not knowing it I was walking around the City of Atlanta with white circles on my face lol I was so mad. The product can be a very good one to use it just need little more work because its not a good product for medium to dark brown skin. And it sucks I had to wast all that money to figure that out.</li>
    <li> My wife really do not see a difference using this product</li>
    <li> I does work  but I need to reapply during the day if I want to look fabulous all day.</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful product ...  Just be careful not to use to much..  Making sure it evenly spread is important.</li>
    <li> It leaves a white film on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Drys out the skin when applied.&lt;br /&gt;When you put moisturizer over the dry film the results  ( tightness) disappear... A waste of my money..,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get anything to review this stuff.  It works! Poof!  No more wrinkles!  Just put it on--pose in a position that erases your wrinkles--and within moments, you are young, again.  Would get 5 stars, but it doesn&#x27;t pass the salsa dancing test.  Translation--it comes off if I perspire, and needs to be re-applied if I work all day.  I also found it ineffective if I tried to apply makeup under it, or on top of it.  And if I use too much of it, it leaves a flaky film.  Works great though on the 11s between my brow, and on those pesky bed-sheet-wrinkles, too.  If you have wrinkles, don&#x27;t let the negatives ward you off of this product.  It&#x27;s the cheapest, safest, quickest facelift you&#x27;ll ever get.  And it&#x27;s worth every penny.  It&#x27;s a miracle! (I reviewed this product a year ago, and wanted to respond to those consumers who recommend egg whites instead.   I compared both egg whites and Instantly Ageless.  The egg white tightened, but flaked, didn&#x27;t get rid of all my wrinkles, took twice as long to dry, and actually stung a little.  This instantly ageless stuff is instant, gets rid of ALL my wrinkles, and isn&#x27;t irritating to my highly sensitive skin.  I carry the open vial in a ziplock snack bag in my purse, and reapply if I need it.  It is well worth the money--and I can make a vial last for 4+ applications.)</li>
    <li> This is not the real Instantly Ageless by Jeunesse. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a fake. Get real stuff at www.sweet freshness.jeunesseglobal.com</li>
    <li> Well, this product does erace the wrinkles after 2-3 minutes.  But, once I start talking, smiling and generally using my face in the usual manner, the product comes &amp;#34;undone&amp;#34;!  My face is now back to showing the wrinkles.  I guess we all are hoping for the magic wand that will bring our younger faces back!</li>
    <li> Excellenent product try it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does just what it says it does!</li>
    <li> Good but I thought could be better</li>
    <li> I suffer from bags under the eye. All you need is eggwhites. Seriously spend hundreds of $ on products that did not work. Whip egg whites andapply. Last all day. No one can tell iit&#x27;s on your face at all. Stop spending $ and open your fridge and get out the eggs!!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, what a waste of money</li>
    <li> Very Good Product. It&#x27;s not permanent but it works. If you have bags or puffiness this will help!</li>
    <li> You put in on and literally the skin tightens before your eyes. Then you put moisturizer on and your circles under your eyes return - even a little faster than they disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other downside, when your &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are all tight for that moment - it only draws attention to wrinkles not touched. Oh well, it was fun watching them disappear for a few.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!! I was leery at first, but with just the first use, it proved that it seriously does work! I felt I looked at least 10 years younger, no exaggeration!!!</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked like the videos and stories I&#x27;ve read. Kind of disappointed. I plan to try it again tomorrow but it didn&#x27;t teduce aging at all.</li>
    <li> Worked fairly well under eyes. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My friend both bought instantly ageless because of a facebook video. We were amazingly disappointed and the hundred and fifty we spent between both our orders went right in the trash. Worst product ever.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t work for me. Made my eyes sore. Sorry</li>
    <li> Not as impressive as I was lead to believe. You can&#x27;t make wrinkles vanish. Without surgery. Case closed.</li>
    <li> Cannot use this product.  Broke mr face out after 1 use.  Will be sending back</li>
    <li> Not even  worth one star.  I applied  this cream, following the directions, and it looked great at first.  Then as more minutes  passed by, it started to flake.  I could  not  apply make up to cover the flakes.  Because them it would smear the makeup and the cream then the bags appear  again.  I didn&#x27;t  purchase on my account my husband  purchased this for me.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Works great when used properly.  Just pat a little from the edge of the eye over to the nose.  A great fix when you are tired and need to look great for an engagement or just daily use.  The more often you use, the better you look.  You will feel a tightness in the skin when used properly</li>
    <li> It is not all it is cracked up to be. It lasts for a few minutes. If you put makeup on your skin goes right back to its original look. Don&#x27;t waste your $$$$$</li>
    <li> Removes all the puffiness for sure, and acts very quickly just like in the videos. However it is so extremely drying to my eye area I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last but about an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Bought a sample first to try and so glad I didnt waste any more money.  Firstly, it does work.  You pat a tiny amount under your eye and leave it to dry.  As it drys you feel your skin pulling tighter but the feeling is awful.  It was like putting on a face mask, letting it dry but not pulling it back off.  It leaves a layer of what feels like egg white under you eye.  It then goes all dry and looks like salt water marks left on your skin.  Dont waste your money.  I tried a what I now know is a similar product called Rox and its exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Irritated my eyes, gives a dry appearance to eyes, and leaves a residue with even a small amount used. It may work for some but the irritation that it caused to my eye area wasn&#x27;t worth trying again.. Also, beware that this is NOT by Jueness as it states in the Q &amp; A section.. Ingredients appear to be the same but I&#x27;d call it a knock-off since they use the same name as Jueness does (Instantly Ageless)</li>
