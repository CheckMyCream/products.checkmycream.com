      <li>One of the best go to fragrances I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>

      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IIITTTT!</li>

      <li>If you like COTTON CANDY you will love the way this smells :)</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and pleased i found another place to buy it.</li>
      <li>The scent is amazing and not overly powerful (unless I spray more than four or five times), so spritzing on one or two sprays before a concert or gig is not a problem</li>
      <li>It could easily be my shampoo or my body lotion or my soap that smells sweet and nice</li>
      <li>All I knew about it was that it was very sweet.</li>
      <li>The perfume does smell very very sweet.</li>
      <li>She loves to wear feminine clothes, and to experiment with colors and styles; she&#x27;s very artistic.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a \\&quot;food\\&quot; scent to add to my collection of perfume--- hopefully some sweet and dessert-like as many of the reviews described.  </li>
      <li>and I feel super girly when I wear it :).</li>
      <li>I always run out so quickly!</li>
      <li>Like all the other reviews, if you like sweet smelling perfumes then this is perfect.</li>
      <li>do however really like this fragrance because even thought it seems kind of cheap when I smell it right out of the bottle, when I put it on the cheapbabypowderlike scent</li>
      <li>I thought I would try out this perfume after hearing so many positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>It smells like vanilla musk and candy but not sick envy sweet.</li>
      <li>It is definitely a sweet scent, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It found this scent to be overly sweet and overpowering.</li>
      <li>Adult version of candy, actually really nice.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy and sweet stuff.</li>
      <li>It is intensified vanilla, caramel and sugary sweet.</li>
      <li>Sweet.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t feel super dressed up with it.</li>
      <li>It is very sweet and very girly.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m not usually a fan of overly sweet scents, this dry-down was extremely appealing, and in the end, I felt that this was a fragrance I would wear</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy yet innocent, sweet yet spicy--awesome for young women in particular.</li>
      <li>When I sampled it in the store, I thought that Pink Sugar had a sweet, girly scent somewhat reminiscent of cotton candy, and it seemed like a perfect match for my pink-loving friend.  </li>
      <li>A great everyday perfume.</li>
      <li>It also sometimes reminds me of baby powder which I really don&#x27;t like because although I actually like the smell of baby powder I think it is kind of cheap for a perfume or body spray to smell like baby powder.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m picky and rarely give five stars.</li>
      <li>I really like sweet fragrances</li>
      <li>Very feminine scent that will not offend even the most sensitive noses.</li>
      <li>So I bought it without smelling it first.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be wearing it another ten!  </li>
      <li>but this is the first time I have ordered it online.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just such a yummy, pretty, innocent scent</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have enough pink perfumes already lol).</li>
      <li>The product arrived in perfect condition; however, I received it several days later than expected.  </li>
      <li>OMG it smells so good and fruity and last a long time</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, I do think the appeal of this perfume is limited to those who prefer scents that are a bit more on the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; or feminine side.  </li>
      <li>and it was very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I love Pink Sugar.  </li>
      <li>Smells like real candy cotton</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>I use it for my workout sessions when I tend to get really sweaty.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>boyfriend absolutely loves the smell as well</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t help adoring the scent of this perfume.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Love Pink Sugar...</li>
      <li>It makes me feel young at heart when I wear it and very girlie.</li>
      <li>performing a lot, so I like to smell good--without it being overpowering, which is often a problem (especially on a stage or in orchestra where lots of powerful perfumes can be nauseating, or in a crowded room).</li>
      <li>but it just comes to show that the scent is more childish than I thought.</li>
      <li>Its scent is sweet and lasts long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this scent!! I always get complimented on it!</li>
    <li> A great everyday perfume. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments from students and teachers alike. It&#x27;s kind of strong smelling, and the vanilla/musk combination sticks out the most for me. The only complaint I have is that I&#x27;d have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance because someone recommended it to me and because of the great reviews in here. All I knew about it was that it was very sweet. I really like sweet fragrances so I thought I would give it try since it had great reviews and it was very inexpensive. The packaging is so cute! It&#x27;s adorable! I love it:)(like I don&#x27;t have enough pink perfumes already lol). The perfume does smell very very sweet. It basically smells like candy. I feel like eating it sometimes haha. I obviously expected it to be sweet based on the reviews, the name (\\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; I mean c&#x27;mon) and the packaging itself but for some reason I thought it was going to be a little bit more grown up. It reminds me of my first \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot; or scented lotions from when I was little which is not really a bad thing but it just comes to show that the scent is more childish than I thought. It also sometimes reminds me of baby powder which I really don&#x27;t like because although I actually like the smell of baby powder I think it is kind of cheap for a perfume or body spray to smell like baby powder. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but baby powder scents make me think of low quality for some reason haha.&lt;br /&gt;I do however really like this fragrance because even thought it seems kind of cheap when I smell it right out of the bottle, when I put it on the cheapbabypowderlike scent is not noticeable anymore and it just leaves a very very sweet, pleasant fragrance on my skin and I really like it. Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t make my head hurt or bother me considering it is very sweet. It&#x27;s just such a yummy, pretty, innocent scent and I feel super girly when I wear it :). What I also like about this fragrance is that I can wear it even on the most casual day ever because it doesn&#x27;t really smell like \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; Maybe that doesn&#x27;t make sense at all haha but what I mean is that it&#x27;s not strong so I don&#x27;t feel super dressed up with it. It could easily be my shampoo or my body lotion or my soap that smells sweet and nice and I like that :) Is my girly no commitment fragrance :)that :) Is my girly no commitment fragrance :)</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume for life!</li>
    <li> Great price with fast service. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in perfect condition; however, I received it several days later than expected.  I hope that this can be attributed to poor weather conditions, as I hope to continue doing business with the seller.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and pleased i found another place to buy it. Everyone im near loves the smell but hate me at the same time as they want to eat sugar cookies when im around :-)</li>
    <li> Like all the other reviews, if you like sweet smelling perfumes then this is perfect. It makes me feel young at heart when I wear it and very girlie. The dry down is much better than the initial spray. It lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is another perfume i bought without knowing how it smell and i LOVE IT OMG it smells so good and fruity and last a long time i will be getting another bottle.</li>
    <li> I get nothing but compliments when I wear this! I love it! I am 29.....</li>
    <li> One of the best go to fragrances I&#x27;ve had so far. It smells like vanilla musk and candy but not sick envy sweet. Mature enough for the young office professional but also is one of those fragrances you want to wear to just have fun. I&#x27;m picky and rarely give five stars.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help adoring the scent of this perfume. It is so incredibly girly and feminine and whenever I wear it people always say &amp;#34;mmm, it smells like candy!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve put it on early in the morning and by the end of the day people can still smell it. I always run out so quickly!</li>
    <li> Yeah...it smells JUST like cotton candy. It&#x27;s kinda delicious. I would have given it  5 stars if it lasted longer during the day. The scent just disappears before the end of the work day (on me anyhow).  Sweet, yummy, and great for summer!</li>
    <li> Love Pink Sugar... It is one of my favorite fragrances. Its scent is sweet and lasts long. It&#x27;s kind of scented oil and always pleases others. Is cheap and nice.. I can&#x27;t wait order other!</li>
    <li> I thought I would try out this perfume after hearing so many positive reviews.  I was looking for a \\&quot;food\\&quot; scent to add to my collection of perfume--- hopefully some sweet and dessert-like as many of the reviews described.  Unfortunatly, to me, this begins with a blast of cotton candy but then, within a minute, goes straight into a harsh black licorice smell until the scent wears off.  At some points, I would get hints of a dark jelly bean or hard candy, but I never got any hints of sweet sugariness like I was imagining.  I went ahead and gave it three stars because for the price, you do receive a lot, and licorice and cotton candy are in the notes.  For me, though, I found no hints of any fruits, vanilla, or carmel.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 18 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves to wear feminine clothes, and to experiment with colors and styles; she&#x27;s very artistic. She also loves candy. She loved this scent.</li>
    <li> I love Pink Sugar.  I have been wearing this perfume for almost ten years and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be wearing it another ten!  It isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly strong and I get tons of compliments!  I definitely recommend this perfume!</li>
    <li> If you like COTTON CANDY you will love the way this smells :)&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I am a young classical musician in college who is around people socializing/performing a lot, so I like to smell good--without it being overpowering, which is often a problem (especially on a stage or in orchestra where lots of powerful perfumes can be nauseating, or in a crowded room). The scent is amazing and not overly powerful (unless I spray more than four or five times), so spritzing on one or two sprays before a concert or gig is not a problem and I am sometimes complimented on how I smell by both strangers and colleagues! My mom and I also have migraines which can sometimes be triggered by perfume, but she loves this stuff and it&#x27;s never been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend absolutely loves the smell as well and we are both especially glad that it&#x27;s a bubbly cotton candy scent that isn&#x27;t meant for a five year old. It&#x27;s sexy yet innocent, sweet yet spicy--awesome for young women in particular. Lasts all day and I never get tired of the smell. Definitely recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good!  I took a risk ordering this because I had never smelled this scent before, but I am glad I bought it anyway!  It is very sweet and very girly.  Definitely doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or too childish.</li>
    <li> They loved their presents....</li>
    <li> I get compliments continuously when I wear it. I hate telling people what kind it is. I want to keep it all to myself.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this perfume for a friend.  When I sampled it in the store, I thought that Pink Sugar had a sweet, girly scent somewhat reminiscent of cotton candy, and it seemed like a perfect match for my pink-loving friend.  Throughout the day, however, I continued to notice the fragrance, which I had sampled on my own wrist.  Over time, the sweet component of the scent faded somewhat, leaving behind warmer, fuller notes that had both a vanilla and a musky quality.  Although I&#x27;m not usually a fan of overly sweet scents, this dry-down was extremely appealing, and in the end, I felt that this was a fragrance I would wear myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I do think the appeal of this perfume is limited to those who prefer scents that are a bit more on the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; or feminine side.  However, if you have dismissed Pink Sugar as being too sweet for you, you might want to give it a try and see if you like the way this fragrance transforms over time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is a tween.  It smells like cotton candy and she loves it.  Its a happy smell.  Adults could wear as well too maybe after a shower or to uplift there mood.</li>
    <li> Love it.Sweet. And I&#x27;m not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> I receive compliments on this perfume EVERY time I wear it! I have even introduced several friends to Pink Sugar, and it is now their &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent too! You will not be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for years but this is the first time I have ordered it online.  The coloring of the product I received is much darker and the perfume smells like it is broken down - almost a burnt scent to the normal light, sweet smell that I love about this perfume.  The bottle also does not say Aquolina anywhere on it - not sure if its new packaging or counterfeit but either way I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Been using this perfume for years. Still get compliments off of it.</li>
    <li> Smells great shipped fast</li>
    <li> It found this scent to be overly sweet and overpowering. It is intensified vanilla, caramel and sugary sweet. It is EDT but the staying power is insane. I use it for my workout sessions when I tend to get really sweaty.</li>
    <li> Smells Excellent!! I smell delicious and it lasts all day. The name of the perfume gives the impression it is not a real great scent. I get so many compliments on how great I smell. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IIITTTT!</li>
    <li> I have been looking at getting this fragrance for forever now. Adult version of candy, actually really nice. (but of course perfume smells a little differently on everyone)</li>
    <li> This had been my scent for almost 5 yrs now. When I am around people they always ask what I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so delicious, like cotton candy, or vanilla cake. It is definitely a sweet scent, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Although it doesn&#x27;t last a very long time, it&#x27;s cheaper than most perfumes at department stores.  Very feminine scent that will not offend even the most sensitive noses.</li>
    <li> Smells like real candy cotton</li>
    <li> Be careful, it has a very heavy scent so only use a little bit of it. It will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I have heard so many good things about this perfume. So I bought it without smelling it first. Ugh. It gives me a migraine. It doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy and sweet stuff. Oh no. It smells like black licorice and musk. I don&#x27;t see what the hype is. Just nasty.</li>
    <li> My Aunt had this perfume when I lived with her in San Antonio and I loved the way it smelled! And I would always steal it from her and dowse myself with it every morning before work. So I was really excited to order it and have my own bottle! But when I got it in the mail, it was so old that it had turned into syrup and wreaked! I was so bumbed. But since it&#x27;s wrapped in that cylinder can, you can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s gone stale so I don&#x27;t blame the seller. But still I was out $12.00 for skunked perfume. So I was pretty disappointed over all.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. Not overwhelming, just light and sugary. Some of the kids at school where I work say I smell like cookies or cupcakes. :)</li>
    <li> wonderful product &amp; super fast shipping! it came within 2 days and i&#x27;m pleased with the product as well :)&lt;br /&gt;the scent, in my opinion, didn&#x27;t seem as marshmallowy/cotton candyish as i expected but it still smells wonderful. would definitely recommend!</li>
