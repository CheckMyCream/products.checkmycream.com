    <li> I gave this lotion 3 stars because I like the scent, however it has dried up lotion pieces or lint in it when I put the lotion on. It happens every time that I put it on. I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t me. So I tried my Nivea Lotion and I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I don&#x27;t know what to do, because I like the lotion in fact, I ordered a travel size bottle and I don&#x27;t have that problem with it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anybody else, because it could be very annoying.</li>
    <li> Do not care for the smell at all.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and makes my hands feel great! Fast delivery too!!</li>
    <li> This garbage. I bought this because the online reviews seemed to be raving. I won&#x27;t do that again. It smells wretched - like bubblegum. What do I look like as a grown a$$ woman walking around smelling like bubblicious?? It is equivalent to a dollar store brand lotion in moisturizing and i have to put on lotion throughout the day because my skin gets dry again. I threw this crap out. Then had to take the garbage out early because it reeked of bubblegum.</li>
    <li> received damaged, top smashed and lotion everywhere</li>
    <li> This lotion not only smells good, but it leaves my skin feeling refined. Its a great size that will last months. Its wonderful and I recommend this to anyone looking for a moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> Hempz body lotion is pleasant smelling.  It absorbs quickly without stickiness.  The dispenser is handy.  Will order again when necessary.</li>
    <li> Smells super yummy, and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> great price. can&#x27;t find it like this in stores. love this product.</li>
    <li> The original scent is my favorite, but I think the others are nice also. This one reminds me of bubble gum.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion... always try to have some on hand.</li>
    <li> Great product. The pump on the other hand quit working after 3 uses. Very cheap.</li>
    <li> Use this every day and it is the best.</li>
    <li> The feel of this lotion and absorption is really nice. I will not know the long term results as the fragrance is so strong it gave me a headache. When it arrived I just put some on my hands and had to eventually wash it off because the odor was killing my head. It did not have any indication on the ad or the bottle that there was a fragrance, I do not care much for fragrance but I have never had one that bother me as much as this one did. I offered it to my wife and after she smelled it she said that she would use it for her legs and feet but not anywhere near her face.</li>
    <li> Love the Hempz brand.</li>
