      <li>Best stuff on the market</li>
      <li>one of the best products i have ever used.</li>
      <li>has worked great for us.</li>
      <li>But Amazon came through with a vender that had it for a great price.</li>
      <li>so I bought the pack of 2 this time at a great price.</li>
      <li>Searched everywhere for it again and am so glad I found it here!!</li>
      <li>which is good for fair skinned people.  </li>
      <li>This was a great-deal for good suncreen.  </li>
      <li>Good product, good deal.</li>
      <li>and we were good for 1/2 the day, a touch up coating at lunch and good through the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>This is a great value and even better when you get the multi-pack.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would order it again!</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is amazing.</li>
      <li>, nice fragrance, stays put like it says when swimming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and his product seems to do a non greasy good job of protecting my skin.</li>
      <li>Finding a great product for a better than average price and deliver VERY quickly with no additional charge is better than good, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
      <li>No AD works just as well for most people.</li>
      <li>We need large amounts for our summer camp, and this was a good deal.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily</li>
      <li>It is light and no greecy feeling at all</li>
      <li>Born and raised in Scotland with two known skin colors - white or bright (sunburned) red.&lt;br /&gt;Our family stocked up on this and brought it to a destination wedding in the tropics.  </li>
      <li>It seems to last well, and is not terribly greasy.</li>
      <li>I bought No-ad Spf#30 several years back because of a good write up in a consumer testing magazine.</li>
      <li>We love it and keep it on our boat all summer long.</li>
      <li>Used this by accident in the past and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I only wish that they would come out with a fragrance free version for those of us that would prefer not to smell like sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Does its job and shows you how much the others are overcharging you.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that plans to be in the sun much of the time.</li>
      <li>We live in Arizona with</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and play golf all summer.</li>
      <li>and it was just as good as the more expensive brand names if not better.</li>
      <li>Most sunscreen prices are ridiculous.  </li>

    <li> Finding a great product for a better than average price and deliver VERY quickly with no additional charge is better than good, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> Being a fan of SPF15 this was really thick.....which is good for fair skinned people.  I will use it for extended periods in sun.&lt;br /&gt;NoAD is one of the only sunscreens I have found that I can use continually without fear of breakouts.</li>
    <li> Does its job and shows you how much the others are overcharging you.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, product just as expected. We have used this brand for years but have a hard time finding it locally now. It seems to last well, and is not terribly greasy.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and play golf all summer. The No Ad is non greasy, and protects my skin from burning.</li>
    <li> Most sunscreen prices are ridiculous.  Big Names, blah, blah, blah.  No AD works just as well for most people.</li>
    <li> This was a great-deal for good suncreen.  NO-AD is affordable sunscreen that works.  We need large amounts for our summer camp, and this was a good deal.</li>
    <li> one of the best products i have ever used. It is light and no greecy feeling at all</li>
    <li> Used this by accident in the past and loved it.  Searched everywhere for it again and am so glad I found it here!!</li>
    <li> Use it every day. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and his product seems to do a non greasy good job of protecting my skin.</li>
    <li> Born and raised in Scotland with two known skin colors - white or bright (sunburned) red.&lt;br /&gt;Our family stocked up on this and brought it to a destination wedding in the tropics.  A liberal coating in the morning and we were good for 1/2 the day, a touch up coating at lunch and good through the rest of the day. No greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;We all arrived home with the same pasty white color we had when we left, despite sitting out in the tropical sun for hours on end. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> This is a great value and even better when you get the multi-pack.  I only wish that they would come out with a fragrance free version for those of us that would prefer not to smell like sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Ordered this 2-pack sunscreen from reviews I read here. I had never heard of it before, but between the reviews and the price, I decided to give it a try. I love it and would order it again! Goes on easily, nice fragrance, stays put like it says when swimming. I even did a test of it by using four different sunscreens I had on hand at once, different ones on chest, arms, legs, face, and it was just as good as the more expensive brand names if not better. Good product, good deal.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market</li>
    <li> It leaves a little bit of a shine on your skin, but does not feel greasy or uncomfirtable. Do keep it away from your eyes, like you would any sunscreen. It even lasts about another 1-2 hours after being in the water. I use this every summer season when out at the lake in Atlanta, Ga.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing. We love it and keep it on our boat all summer long. We use either the SPF 15 or 30 all day and never burn.</li>
    <li> I bought No-ad Spf#30 several years back because of a good write up in a consumer testing magazine. We live in Arizona with it&#x27;s harsh temps and constant sunshine and No-ad has worked great for us. My wife uses it every day under her make-up and loves that it is not sticky or greasy. She gets nervous when the bottle starts to run low so I bought the pack of 2 this time at a great price. I would highly recommend it to anyone that plans to be in the sun much of the time. I tried to get it locally from several of the local pharmacies or big box stores listed on the N0-ad web sites but they had no idea what I was talking about. But Amazon came through with a vender that had it for a great price.</li>
