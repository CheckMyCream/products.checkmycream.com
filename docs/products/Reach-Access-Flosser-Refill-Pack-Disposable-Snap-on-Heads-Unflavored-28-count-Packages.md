      <li>I am so glad that Amazon has this available!</li>

      <li>I like the non-waxed flossers because they remove more plaque than the waxed variety.  </li>
      <li>: Costs a lot more than it should.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, they are more costly than flavored flossers you can buy in stores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like using a toothbrush</li>
      <li>I have the feeling that regular floss may be the best type to use for getting into all the nooks and crannies.</li>
      <li>I do not understand why Johnson &amp; Johnson do not promote it more.</li>
      <li>These things work great and make flossing much easier.</li>
      <li>This is the first assisted flossing product I ever tried and while it was good the replacement heads were pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>product is easy to use, and hygenic.</li>
      <li>Breaks easily.</li>
      <li>If you want to floss your teeth the easy way get these refill packs.  </li>

      <li>Together with the Reach Access Flosser, these refills are easy to snap on use.</li>

      <li>I have zero complaints about this item, and the big refill packs are great.</li>
      <li>They are very easy to use and great for cleaning between teeth, especially if your teeth are very crowded..</li>

      <li>I prefer the original packaging.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more one of these days!</li>
      <li>This is effective but not as good as simple regular floss which is so much more cost efficient.</li>
      <li>These flossers are only intermittently obtainable in my area, so I was thrilled that they were available on Amazon.  </li>

      <li>I ordered these refills and found them to be even better quality than the three extra that came in my original flosser!</li>
      <li>Love the flosser tool -- easier for old arthritic hands and fingers.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Reach flossers for years because they are high quality and easy to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are nice and a good price. Only local ones I ever find are mint. I don&#x27;t need mint.</li>
    <li> These things work great and make flossing much easier. Also, they are sturdy enough to be reused several times. I typically use one head for several days or a week and they work fine. Only downside is that they are a bit difficult to remove and you can break the reach flosser if you try to force it out too hard. This has only happened to me once all the years I have been using the reach flosser, so you should be okay. Might also be a little expensive for some plastic with a little bit of floss on it, but not outrageous as you can make the pack last a long while if you reuse each head for a few days.</li>
    <li> I have ised these for years. These were an add on sale item and the price made them a  great value.</li>
    <li> After being reminded by my dentist that I needed to floss more, my hygienist suggested these. Together with the Reach Access Flosser, these refills are easy to snap on use. The floss goes in easily between my teeth and accessing the back teeth has never been easier. Despite my gag reflex issues, I have had no problems with this. I have been purchasing this product for almost a year now and don&#x27;t regret it. My dentist has even noticed the improvement with my gums. They are cheap and last almost an entire month. If you are looking for an easier method to flossing, check out the Reach Access Flosser and the refill packs. Your gums will thank you!</li>
    <li> This makes it a lot easier to floss.</li>
    <li> Cheap, easy to use and carry. Simple to install. Excellent in removing food particles stuck. Most efficient in its job.</li>
    <li> As my review for the reach handles points out, I think this is the best flossing system out there...maybe not as portable as the string in the cassette, but a hell of alot easier to manipulate....I&#x27;m a big believer.</li>
    <li> These Floss Refills are great! Both my husband and myself use them. A bit hard to find where we live so this was great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was just what we were needing to accompany our Reach Access.  We love the amount that is in the package.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this product online.  I could no longer find the Reach brand in the stores here.  I can&#x27;t have mint so I was happy to stock up on these.  Reach flossers are much easier to use than regular floss.  And my dental hygienist said they can be rinsed and reused until they break so they last a long time.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Love the flosser tool -- easier for old arthritic hands and fingers.  Flosser inserts are very hard to find in the local stores around here -- so once again, Amazon comes through.</li>
    <li> With this flossing system I am finally able to really floss my teeth well and easily.  I was very happy and then I had an appointment with my dentist.  Both he and my hygenist were very pleased with how good my mouth was.  I will keep buying these.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a refill. Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> I never flossed regularly before my dental hygenist recommended I get the Reach Access Flosser. I have become obsessed with flossing and can&#x27;t sleep if I don&#x27;t floss before bed.  I have bought these for all my friends and family and have converted many people to better dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach flosser is better than similar knock-offs as the floss is perpendicular to the handle, making it easier to get between your teeth.  The refills also stay put a lot better than they do with other brands.  These ones won&#x27;t get pulled out between tight spaces in teeth.  I have zero complaints about this item, and the big refill packs are great.</li>
    <li> Speed up your visits to dentists, make the hygienist &amp; gums happy.while the flossers are basically single use the are only way to get to the back few teeth with my mitts. Missed 5 star since the flossers snag on some of my dental work GLIDE version would be welcome option</li>
    <li> recently discovered reach and believe ti is much less medieval on my fingers. On second thought I would have ordered the mint one.</li>
    <li> I only wish the floss were a little stronger.  Usually one head is good for multiple flossing sessions, but occasionally the floss catches on a tooth and breaks.  However, having a good supply of replacements on hand, it&#x27;s easy to swap in a new head.  Or whatever the business end is called.</li>
    <li> The flosser works great. I could never use traditional floss because it requires opening the mouth very wide to fit fingers and floss in. I have TMJ, so this would cause pain for days afterward. I had given up on the idea of flossing my teeth when I found this. I am so sad that the unflavored ones are no longer made (I can&#x27;t use mint.) I recommend these for anyone who also has trouble with traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> I have used this flosser  for several years. I do not understand why Johnson &amp; Johnson do not promote it more.</li>
    <li> I HATE THE REEGULAR DENTAL FLOSS THAT I HAVE TO WRAP AROUNF MY FINGER.  THIS IS SO MUCH CLEANER AND EASIER TO USE.</li>
    <li> Reach Access Flosser Refill Pack Disposable Snap-on heads, Unflavored, 28... works great and the best price available. Reach is a good method in flossing your teeth.</li>
    <li> much easier to use then dental floss. I do not have to stick my fingers in my mouth. easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I actually floss easily and consistently because of these things... and they don&#x27;t have nasty flavored gel in them to boot!</li>
    <li> I got the reach flosser from my dental hygienist after a horrifying visit-i was told i had gingivitis with a couple of 4-5 mm pockets. I had never been a regular flosser, in fact, i could probably count on one hand how many times i&#x27;d flossed in the past year before the visit, as disgusting as that sounds. I sat through a visit of mouthfuls and mouthfuls of blood-this is not an exaggeration. Needless to say, this was obviously a big wake up call for me. I started using the reach flosser and found that it was way easier to floss with than any of floss picks or regular floss i&#x27;d ever used. I ordered these refills and found them to be even better quality than the three extra that came in my original flosser! I tend to change them every couple days, as they don&#x27;t fray so quickly and I rinse it after each use. I just had another cleaning today, and came out with positive reviews! Way less bleeding than before, and smaller pockets!&lt;br /&gt;So, the moral of this is, get this flosser, and if you or anyone you know sucks at flossing their teeth, i can pretty much assure you that it will get easier!</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Amazon has this available! No stores in my local area have the unflavored refills anymore! I prefer these over the mint flavored refills. Those taste like cheap toothpaste - I literally have to reinse my mouth out several times after using those. With the unflavored, I use them and rince once. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good product. Delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This is effective but not as good as simple regular floss which is so much more cost efficient.</li>
    <li> This is the first assisted flossing product I ever tried and while it was good the replacement heads were pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few other brands to save a bit of money and I am sorry I did.  I don&#x27;t know why its hard to make a small piece of plastic with a string between it but apparently its harder than I thought because the other companies that make similar products to this one do a terrible job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these were cheaper because I don&#x27;t have choice but to buy them.</li>
    <li> The arrangement was excellent.</li>
    <li> These Reach flossers are great.  I have never been able to floss with a string, but these solved my problem.</li>
    <li> These are &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; quality and quite handy to have around. No cons that I can think of. They are pretty basic refills for the flosser marketed by Reach.</li>
    <li> way to expensive for 2 packs. As J&amp;J has discontinued the unflavored product, I can understand why they want the most money possible. Sad that the only floss they sell now is mint. Oh and they sell a starter package that still come with unflavored, but the replacements are all MINT!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dentist, they are a better price &amp;#34;slightly&amp;#34; than at some drug stores, but the sneaky &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; program sees to a last minute jump in price before they ship.  Not right.  I&#x27;m ready to quit &amp;#34;S&amp;S&amp;#34; because it has become &amp;#34;sneak and snub&amp;#34;. If you complain, they imply &amp;#34;take it or leave it&amp;#34;.  The most unpleasant bunch at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use these flossers multiple times a day and love them.  The price is reasonable and if you have arthritis in your hands, these are virtually painless, unlike floss.</li>
    <li> A+ product and shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> The quality control is not the greatest with this product, but the ability to reach the back teeth make it worth the quality problem.  Note: they are removing this prodict from the subscribe  and save program</li>
    <li> The flossers are great &amp; fastest delivery I&#x27;ve EVER had!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> As I have past history of gum disease it is important to floss regularly and these snap-on heads allow easy access to teeth in back of mouth. Amazon is one of few places I can buy the unflavored version(which I prefer over mint flavor)</li>
    <li> I prefer the original packaging.  It was a plastic container which each head was slotted singly.  You could fit the head on in the pkg.&lt;br /&gt;Then close the lid.  No jumble-no mess.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, but I&#x27;m not buying from Amazon after their \\&quot;Add-on program\\&quot;. Living in Manhattan, it seems less of a hassle to walk by a CVS or Duane rather than making an Amazon order of over $25.</li>
    <li> I cannot buy these locally. I have to order them from the internet. They are a very good way of cleaning between the teeth</li>
    <li> So what is it with the stores, that they seem to have decided everyone who uses a Reach Access Flosser wants flavored floss?  I finally found unflavored here, and bought two packs.  That should keep me a while.</li>
    <li> Thank you for giving me the access to unflavored refill for my flosser. I have a hard time finding them and when I do they are mint flavored which I do not want.</li>
    <li> I received my order (Reach Access Flosser Refill Pack Disposable Snap-on heads, Unflavored, 28 pack X 2 ) on time with no problems. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
    <li> Excellent handle but the floss string does not last long enough for me.  Breaks easily. Needs to be replaced too soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, quick shipping</li>
    <li> My dentist will be very happy that I purchased these flosser refills.  I have never been a flosser, I always want to but I find it a pain in the butt to do with normal floss.  Then, I discovered the reach access flosser by way of a free sample.  They are awesome, allowing me to floss with ease.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find the refills in my local stores so I was happy Amazon had a big pack for not too much money.</li>
    <li> needed the product but too expensive</li>
    <li> I only replace these once every few weeks. After I floss, I&#x27;ll just wash it off good and use it again and again.</li>
    <li> After years of small cuts in my fingers from using regular floss, I gave these a try. Although more expensive, it works great and could not be easier to use. Even my dentist admits using them.</li>
    <li> I like the non-waxed flossers because they remove more plaque than the waxed variety.  I got this order quickly and was pleased with the price.  They also came in 2 packs which I have never seen in the store.  Unwaxed refills are almost impossible to find in any store.</li>
    <li> Pros: Exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Costs a lot more than it should. Thinking about moving to the flimsier plastic ones, since refills seem to cost so much for the Reach.</li>
    <li> Good flossers. I like these flossers since they are nice and thin and fit easily in my back teeth which are very close together. Plus the handle that they are partnered with is just the right length.</li>
    <li> this batch of flossers has been much better for me. i bought a pack of mint heads before this. those were terrible.. they would often break immediately and they hardly lasted more than one flossing.</li>
    <li> Flossing was always recommended by the dentist but never something I managed to do until I discovered this product. Thank you Reach. What a difference you have made!</li>
    <li> This product is not like what comes with the Reach Flosser.  These apparently are not wax coated, because they stick in my teeth, and seem to start breaking much quicker than the ones that come on the original product.</li>
    <li> These plain floss pick refills are my preferred alternative to the traditional floss, because they can actually reach between my back teeth. It&#x27;s a shame that we have I now pay a premium because they are discontinued; they are much better than the flavored ones (because the idea of leaving flavor behind when you floss seems both gross and counter to the whole concept of flossing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stars for functionality, minus one for prices these days.</li>
    <li> Good price for something I use every day.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more one of these days! d</li>
    <li> $1 per floss?  Ridiculously overpriced.  You will spend less if you buy a new handle with 1 packet of 8 every time - they usually cost less than $3 in most pharmacies.</li>
    <li> If you are like most people, flossing is a pain and we don&#x27;t do it enough.  These make it a lot easier to floss and keep the dentist from beating you up too much at the next visit.  I use mine about 3-4 times before tossing it, I know I shouldn&#x27;t but I still do.  Can&#x27;t find these in stores so order them here.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> good product. i have been using it for many years and recently have been unable to find it in stores</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that these are quite pricey and sometimes one will break between tight contacts so I that I have to use 2 that day.  But it is still much better than wrapping the strand of floss around my fingers.  The older I get, the thinner the skin gets on my fingers and the old way of flossing can be quite painful.</li>
    <li> I have giant man hands and a tiny mouth. This is the only way to floss as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the Reach Flosser as much as I thought I would.  It seems easier that string floss but my dentist doesn&#x27;t recommend it as a replacement to regular flossing.  As such, I have found G.U.M. soft-picks for the front 3/4 and Reach for the back to be a effective alternative to string floss.</li>
    <li> This was Dentist recommended for hemiplegic person. It works well with the long handle and easy to maneuver inside the mouth.</li>
    <li> My husband has used the Reach Access Flosser for years and I&#x27;ve had a really difficult time finding the refills for the flosser.  When shopping on Amazon, I thought about the flosser and decided to do a search; my search results found the refills!  The price on Amazon was competitive, so I bought them.  I&#x27;m very happy that I found them and so is my husband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenience and ease of shopping through Amazon online as well as savings offered through Prime Membership and fast shipping is why I shop on Amazon when the price is right.  Why go to town or local store when it can be delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> These flossers do a great job keeping our teeth healthy. My wife and I prefer the unflavored type which are hard to find on store shelves.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Reach and the Access Floss Refill Pack I have made it a daily routine to floss.  My teeth are happy and my dentist as well.  Good product. I order this product by Amazon subscription</li>
    <li> I had run out and my dentist didn&#x27;t sell refills so I searched and found these.  They fit my reach handle perfectly and they work great!</li>
    <li> He only likes the unflavored flossers and they are hard to find where I live.  Got them in a big pack to last for a while.</li>
    <li> Can only find mint flavored in the stores. I&#x27;m allergic to mint, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find this!!&lt;br /&gt;These are the best!</li>
    <li> Great price, super-fast shipping, no hassles.</li>
    <li> still break too quick</li>
    <li> I floss more with these things than I ever did before.  Worth the extra cost to me.  If you dislike flossing with the regular tape give these a try.</li>
    <li> Quick service from vendor. These are really handy. I have the feeling that regular floss may be the best type to use for getting into all the nooks and crannies. But these snap-on heads are so convenient, and you CAN work the angles for maximum reach, while still avoiding the messiness of getting saliva on your hands and fingers. It&#x27;s also nice to be able to get unflavored if you don&#x27;t like the overwhelmingly strong tastes of most flavored dental products. Reach was recommended to me by my hygienist.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. I do. And if it weren&#x27;t for these, I probably wouldn&#x27;t very often. Thankfully, I have the Reach Flosser so my dentist and hygienist are happy, too.</li>
    <li> product is easy to use, and hygenic. I usually just put the handle in the dish washer to keep it clean. it would be nice if the pack snapped closed though</li>
    <li> If you want to floss your teeth the easy way get these refill packs.  It beats tying a floss string around the fingers and trying to get to the back teeth.</li>
    <li> I prefer these to those little flossing arms.  It&#x27;s more like using a toothbrush and I like that I don&#x27;t have to stick my hand deep into my mouth like with traditional flossing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product&lt;br /&gt; for over 5 years. No longer sold in Australia unfortunately. I am a dentist and have recommended this product for a long time. Its streets ahead ofother floss aids.</li>
    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Only place to buy the unflavored ones for me.</li>
    <li> very convieniet  to use.  i use it more than i do dental  floss.  i fel like  iget a better cleaning with the paack disposal then i do dental floss.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  I&#x27;ve never mastered the act of flossing with just the string floss.  These are sooo easy to use with the re-useable handle.  They work great too.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing so I LOVE these. Much easier to reach back with the flosser rather than trying to fit both fists in my mouth with traditional floss. My dentist has no complaints.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these 4-pk anywhere anymore. I have limited use of my left hand and have used the &amp;#34;pre-strung&amp;#34; placquers for years, until i came across the Reach products. These &amp;#34;reach&amp;#34; all the way to the back, which was always a big problem for me with the pre-strung ones. These are awesome and a double order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> These are the best way to floss. They are very easy to use and great for cleaning between teeth, especially if your teeth are very crowded..</li>
    <li> I have been using the Reach flossers for years because they are high quality and easy to use. I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Wish my over-priced dentist gave these away instead of cheap toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected and as advertised.  Cheaper than buying at a grocery or drug store.  Have used and ordered this product many times.</li>
    <li> These flossers are only intermittently obtainable in my area, so I was thrilled that they were available on Amazon.  They are the only way I can floss my teeth, since I have a very small mouth and can&#x27;t get fingers and floss in there at the same time.  I would definitely recommend Amazon to anyone with a need for the same product.  Oh, and the price, even including shipping, is comparable to that in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Way easier than normal flossing and cheaper than getting them at the store. I use them every night and they have helped my gum health immensely.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing a breeze rather than a chore.  Flavored floss is okay, but I like unflavored and the two-pack is just the right size for me (don&#x27;t need a whole lot of them).</li>
    <li> Since allergies cause mouth problems with flavored flossers, this flosser unflavored product does the job.&lt;br /&gt;However, they are more costly than flavored flossers you can buy in stores.</li>
    <li> The flavored kind aren&#x27;t any more pleasant than these plain ones.  These may be a little more inexpensive and it seems like the floss is stronger (frays less) than the blue kind.</li>
    <li> I like the unscented refills and they hold up better than the other ones.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t used them, but my son opened them and they appear&lt;br /&gt;to be just right and what we need for good and easy hygiene&lt;br /&gt;for children/teens.</li>
    <li> these are easy to use and do a good job especially if you have shoulder problems-you only need one hand</li>
