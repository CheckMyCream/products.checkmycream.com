      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>We switched Aussie Kids spray detangler and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>She was very nice and super helpful.</li>
      <li>Also it leaves the most amazing scent.</li>
      <li>Once the hot tot conditioner arrived and I started using that in her hair which works great</li>
      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>so he sweats a lot and this stands the test most days.</li>
      <li>and I really love it....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a must have in our house :)</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous detanglers and have found this one to be the best.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this...</li>
      <li>The best and the only brand I will use going forward for my daughter</li>
      <li>I looked at the ingredients and had imagined it more plant-based smelling if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>The smell is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>the more I sprayed the more I gagged from the smell.</li>
      <li>I love the company.</li>
      <li>Maybe if the spray nozzle would work better?</li>
      <li>Detangles better than any product I have found at a drugstore/large retailer.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh fragrance is amazing</li>
      <li>The cheap Johnson &amp; Johnson detangler works so much better than this one, and the scent of this is so overpowering.</li>
      <li>She has curly hair and it tangles easily.</li>
      <li>Way too strong of a perfume for a toddler.</li>
      <li>Her Mom says the sprayer delivers a much fine and wider coverage mist.  </li>

      <li>It detangles just fine</li>
      <li>Thank you Hot Tot for making such a great product!</li>
      <li>It comes out in a fine mist, not a water texture and my daughter has a ton of hair</li>
      <li>So in love with this...and the smell is clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>safe light &amp; fresh.</li>
      <li>Thanks you for making such a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>It lathers up well but not too much and rinses out so very easily.</li>
      <li>Leaves my girls hair very pretty and easy to comb out.</li>
      <li>LOVE HOT TOT HAIRCARE</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Hot Tot Conditioning Detangler worked great for my bebe boy&#x27;s fine hairs that seem to get tiny tangles in em.</li>
      <li>My daughter has thick hair and this product works GREAT!!!  </li>
      <li>We also use the Sweet Pea Serum after the detangler.</li>
      <li>It has a light, fresh scent and my daughter loves it.  </li>
      <li>They absolutely love how much easier it made it to comb her hair.  </li>
      <li>After seeing this product on shark tank I ordered the shampoo, conditioner, sweet pea serum and detangler.  </li>
      <li>I received a sample of this and when I saw the full price cost I thought there was no way that I would ever buy it.  </li>
      <li>Makes me think this product was designed more for thinner curls or straight hair.</li>
      <li>ONE option at the various stores around here I&#x27;ve checked); and good detangled that smells nice on top of that is even harder to find.  </li>
      <li>It is very light and natural and everyone should try it!</li>
      <li>Granddaughter has very curly fine hair and in the mornings it is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine hair that tangles very easily and occasionally wipes her hands on her head after eating which leaves me having to wash her hair very thoroughly and then deal with the knots.</li>
      <li>My grand daughter has very long curly fine hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells, but it&#x27;s a nice smell</li>
      <li>The Hot tot conditioning detangler has been a blessing in our household</li>
      <li>I found my solution when we bought Hot Tot detangler.  </li>
      <li>I use it in conjunction with the Hot Tot Curl Serum and his hair</li>
      <li>I spray this in and he is ready for school !  </li>
      <li>I read about Hot Tot on line and thought I would try it.</li>
      <li>I use this after the Hot Tot shampoo for every bath.</li>
      <li>I used it (and no I was not using too much product!)</li>
      <li>This product has been pretty god for our son&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
      <li>Very over powering smell esp for the amount needed to detangle!</li>
      <li>Just straight conditioner that WORKS!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine spray which is important when you are trying to use it on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>It left a film in her hair also meaning I had to wash her hair more during the week</li>
      <li>Beyond the misrepresentation of the product being extraordinarily gentle for kids (using terms like \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and promoting it as being formulated ESPECIALLY for kids), this product does not perform as well as others on the market that are a MUCH better value.  </li>
      <li>and it left a strong smell on my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter has very curly hair that tangles really easily, so detangler is essential for her hair.  </li>
      <li>The Hot tot products came highly recommended to me by a mom&#x27;s chat group</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to saturate her whole head with this product for it to work.</li>
      <li>This works really well on my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really detangle his curls at all.</li>
      <li>I look for two key things in a detangler: 1) it must actual detangle the hair, and 2) it needs to smell nice.  </li>
      <li>My son has long &amp;#34;surfer hair&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t a fan of brushing it because it knots so easily.  </li>

    <li> It detangles just fine but I CANNOT stand the smell. Smells to me like a stink bug.</li>
    <li> Works great. Spray bottle is attractive and it smells awesome. Detangles better than any product I have found at a drugstore/large retailer.</li>
    <li> I ❤ this stuff! The best hair products I&#x27;ve found for my grand-daughters &amp; son&#x27;s. safe light &amp; fresh. The nicest around!</li>
    <li> My daughter has quiet tangly hair and thought this product would be great, unfortunately in my daughters case no it doesn&#x27;t work. It left a film in her hair also meaning I had to wash her hair more during the week I used it (and no I was not using too much product!)</li>
    <li> The Hot tot conditioning detangler has been a blessing in our household&lt;br /&gt;My Granddaughter has very curly fine hair and in the mornings it is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Just a few squirts of the Hot Tot and a few strokes of the brush and her curls are no longer a rat&#x27;s nest.&lt;br /&gt;It used to take forever to get the knots out of her hair and other products left her hair oily and limp.&lt;br /&gt;This detangler works wonders and we don&#x27;t have to pull her hair to get the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for an unbiased review and we use it every day.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product especially after reading positive reviews. Issues with this product: 1) Scent was a bit funky. Even after shaking, it kept coming out smelling pretty artificial. I looked at the ingredients and had imagined it more plant-based smelling if that makes sense. 2) My son has semi-thick curly hair. This didn&#x27;t really detangle his curls at all. Makes me think this product was designed more for thinner curls or straight hair. 3) Couldn&#x27;t justify the price of this when it doesn&#x27;t do the trick. So returned it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Best thing my friend ever told me about! I love that it does not smell horrible, there are no chemicals that make it into a color or to smell like strawberries. Just straight conditioner that WORKS! It lathers up well but not too much and rinses out so very easily. Leaves my girls hair very pretty and easy to comb out. Thank you Hot Tot for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> Way too strong of a perfume for a toddler.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a strange combination of wavy/straight hair over extremely curly locks and this is a must in our house, it makes styling just so much easier</li>
    <li> This product has been pretty god for our son&#x27;s curly hair. The only reason that I would give it 4 out of 5 stars is it really isn&#x27;t much different than just spraying his hair with a water bottle, other than the scent. Works well as a daily styling product in the morning. I use it in conjunction with the Hot Tot Curl Serum and his hair always looks freshly washed and perfect. He&#x27;s a very active toddler so he sweats a lot and this stands the test most days.</li>
    <li> This detangler smells wonderful and works great on my children&#x27;s hair.  Heck, I&#x27;ve used it myself!  It is very light and natural and everyone should try it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my hair stylist told me how good it is for curly haired children. The smell is overwhelming. It smells like rancid baby shampoo. It comes out in a fine mist, not a water texture and my daughter has a ton of hair so I had to use quite a bit and the more I sprayed the more I gagged from the smell. My 4 year old didn&#x27;t like the smell either and asked me to please never use it again. It also weighed her hair down and made it look greasy. We switched Aussie Kids spray detangler and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Love this detangled!  I actually have found it quite hard to find any detangler at all (there is maybe...maybe...ONE option at the various stores around here I&#x27;ve checked); and good detangled that smells nice on top of that is even harder to find.  Finally found the one I&#x27;ll stick with in Hot Tot!  It works well on my daughter&#x27;s thick and growing hair and I might just steal some for myself (I have very long very thick hair).  Awesome!</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine hair that tangles very easily and occasionally wipes her hands on her head after eating which leaves me having to wash her hair very thoroughly and then deal with the knots. I spray this a few times on her hair and comb through so easily that I can&#x27;t believe it. Also it leaves the most amazing scent. Thank you Hot Tot for a great product!</li>
    <li> Works well on my toddlers knots. Smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve secretly used it on my own thick, coarse, curly hair!</li>
    <li> The best and the only brand I will use going forward for my daughter</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to work any better then other detanglers and it left a strong smell on my daughters hair. Once the hot tot conditioner arrived and I started using that in her hair which works great and I don&#x27;t even need the detangler.</li>
    <li> This works really well on my daughters hair. She has curly hair and it tangles easily. I don&#x27;t have to saturate her whole head with this product for it to work. I love the company. On a whim I messaged them on Facebook and got a response within 30 mins. She was very nice and super helpful. How many companies can you fb message and get a response that isn&#x27;t automated?!? That made me love this company even more!!</li>
    <li> I swear by these products! As a mom of a 18 month with crazy hair and stylist I would not use anything else for my girl!! She is amazing and deserves the BEST and this is it!!! LOVE HOT TOT HAIRCARE</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this... As a detangler it does work but my husband and I cant stand how it smells! Very over powering smell esp for the amount needed to detangle! Sadly also bought the curl serum and it smells same and doesnt seem to do much at all!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous detanglers and have found this one to be the best. My grand daughter has very long curly fine hair. Every time we wash her hair it gets tangled and matted. I read about Hot Tot on line and thought I would try it. It worked great. I sprayed it on her hair after shampooing and let it sit for a while. I was able to finally comb her hair without her crying. I also use it on dry hair so that I can comb through without all the tangle. This is a great product</li>
    <li> LOVE this detangler!!  My son has long &amp;#34;surfer hair&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t a fan of brushing it because it knots so easily.  I found my solution when we bought Hot Tot detangler.  It works awesome and smells so good!! No more battles over brushing his hair!  Thank God!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Tames frizz for curly or strait styles. Very light. Non-sticky. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I use this after the Hot Tot shampoo for every bath.</li>
    <li> I have been during this since I seen it on Shark Tank. I will not buy anything else for my kids hair. I have have no problem with any o  the products and I have used them all. Thanks you for making such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product for my hot tot long curly black hair and I really love it....It works well with all types of hair and I recommend all parents to try it.....you will like it and it smells good....</li>
    <li> This detangler is wonderful.  It has a light, fresh scent and my daughter loves it.  There are definitely no more tears when I comb her hair with this spray.  I was a little shocked by the price at first, but it is totally worth it and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product only made my daughter&#x27;s hair sticky and didn&#x27;t help with detangling more than any other product from WalMart. 😕</li>
    <li> So disappointed especially after loving the Sweet Pea Curl Serim. This did not help with detangling at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this spray for my Granddaughter&#x27;s extremely fine curly hair.  I simply refused to try and comb her hair because it always made her cry (After all I am her Grandma).  After seeing this on Shark Tank, I decided to buy some and let Mom and Dad try it on her hair (once again - not me - I&#x27;m Grandma).  They absolutely love how much easier it made it to comb her hair.  Her Mom says the sprayer delivers a much fine and wider coverage mist.  I had also purchased the shampoo and conditioner, but the spray seems to be the biggest hit.  I am not going to rate the shampoo or conditioner, since they haven&#x27;t used those without using the detangling spray.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine spray which is important when you are trying to use it on dry hair.  A little heavy in my opinion.  Maybe if the spray nozzle would work better?</li>
    <li> This product works great for detangling but we also use it to freshen up our daughters hair between washes. It makes it smell and look like it&#x27;s just been washed. It&#x27;s a must have in our house :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter her hair gets so tangled it is a huge rats nest by the end if the day which makes brushing horrible for  her and me. With this product it makes brushing a breeze and I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> After seeing this product on shark tank I ordered the shampoo, conditioner, sweet pea serum and detangler.  This stuff works.  It has a wonderful scent, no chemical smell, and it works!  My son has curls and he rolls around in bed which equals a messy head every morning.  I spray this in and he is ready for school !  (now I do have chase him around to spray him, but that has nothing to do with the spray and more about the boy !)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My 10 year old daughter has long straight fine hair and this product has finally ended the daily struggle!  Nothing has worked as good as this stuff. I highly recommend it if, like me, you spent an hour every day unknotting the tangles.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 month old son who gets that tangly hair spot on the back of his head every time he naps, this helps get the tangles out so gently so he doesn&#x27;t hate getting his hair brushed.  I personally feel the smell is a little too strong and I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells, but it&#x27;s a nice smell so it&#x27;s bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase it again, although it will probably last awhile.</li>
    <li> Beyond the misrepresentation of the product being extraordinarily gentle for kids (using terms like \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and promoting it as being formulated ESPECIALLY for kids), this product does not perform as well as others on the market that are a MUCH better value.  Save your money and don&#x27;t be fooled by the fancy/schmancy package and \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; price.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and when I saw the full price cost I thought there was no way that I would ever buy it.  Since then my little girl&#x27;s hair has became quite tangled.  Brushing it constantly didn&#x27;t resolve the problem so I got out my little sample that I had received and I fell in love.  It&#x27;s fresh fragrance is amazing and it gets her tangles out instantly.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells sooooo good. It definitely detangles without leaving hair feeling sticky or heavy with residue. We also use the Sweet Pea Serum after the detangler. The Hot tot products came highly recommended to me by a mom&#x27;s chat group I&#x27;m a part of on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Interesting trivia: The inventor/owner of these products got her business boost after appearing on the TV show Shark Tank, where entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban invested in the business.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair that tangles really easily, so detangler is essential for her hair.  I look for two key things in a detangler: 1) it must actual detangle the hair, and 2) it needs to smell nice.  This product falls short in both of these areas.  The cheap Johnson &amp; Johnson detangler works so much better than this one, and the scent of this is so overpowering.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my daughter couldn&#x27;t get past the nasty smell of this product. It did not perform any better than any other detangler that we&#x27;ve used. You&#x27;re paying for fancy packaging.</li>
    <li> all natural detangler......Hot Tot Conditioning Detangler worked great for my bebe boy&#x27;s fine hairs that seem to get tiny tangles in em.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; smells great too!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair and this product works GREAT!!!  So in love with this...and the smell is clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> This detangled didn&#x27;t work any better than any other type I have tried for my daughter who has thick hair with curls at the ends.  I don&#x27;t like the way her hair looks and the smell of this product is HORRIBLE!!!  Way too strong and grown up for a preschooler!!!</li>
