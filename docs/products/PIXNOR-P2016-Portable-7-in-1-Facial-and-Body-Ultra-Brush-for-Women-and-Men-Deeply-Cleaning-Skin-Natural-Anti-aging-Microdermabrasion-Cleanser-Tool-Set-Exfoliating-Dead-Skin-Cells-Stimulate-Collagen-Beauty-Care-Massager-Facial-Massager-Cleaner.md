<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Takes 2-AA batteries, easy to take along for travel.  Works great.  I think it would greatly benefit the seller of this product to pair it with an exfoliating scrub.  I happen to have one that I use and when I used it with this system, it takes off all the dead layers of skin on top and my face looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for one of these for months but everyone i saw was 100 or more. When i saw this i scooped it up right away. Its amazing. My face looks and feel better then ever before. I love all the attachments it comes with. This is very high quality.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve never tried any facial scrubbers before that have batteries, usually just a good old wash cloth and a little elbow grease. After hearing about these products I decided to try one. The price on the PIXNOR wasn&#x27;t outstanding, perfectly in my price range. I ordered and it ended up getting to my place faster than expected, always a lovely thing to see from any seller. I opened it, found out I needed 2 AA batteries which I borrowed from a remote from the time being and decided to try it out after a long day at work.&lt;br /&gt;First I took off my makeup with just a wipe, rinsed it with water then started to explore the various attachments provided. I have to say I love them all. The exfoliating head is amazing, my face felt so smooth afterwards! And the massaging beads felt good on my neck and shoulders. The soft bristles perfectly ended the session, leaving my face and neck feeling amazing. In all there are 7 attachments, all great in their own way.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting this product for anyone, teens, twenty-somethings, moms. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s great to have. And it&#x27;s small, not bulky, can fit in your purse for on the go needs, or easily in a carry on or suitcase for traveling without taking up a bunch of extra room. Since you don&#x27;t need to carry around a cord it&#x27;s much more practical too.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a 5/5</li>
    <li> Great product!  Received quickly!  Lots of differnet heads to use!  Great all in one product!</li>
    <li> This is such a great exfoliating tool..may skin is so dry in the winter and more normal in the summer..but helps my cleansing routine.and messages the moisturizers in too..love how it help my skin feel..this is a great product..</li>
    <li> Best thing I love it. It&#x27;s very cool</li>
    <li> This brush works great at deep cleaning my skin. The brush heads are soft and gentle enough on the skin but still cleans thoroughly</li>
    <li> I was interested in trying this skin system, as I have another (name brand) one, which is getting old,  and this one cost a fraction of the one I have. SO, I wanted to do a comparison. On the plus side, this one came with all the gadgets and attachments, whereas the other brand- I have to buy certain attachments separately. On the other hand- this one leaves a lot to be desired. The instructions are in bad English, so obviously this one is shipped from a different country. I found the head of the brush to be too soft, and the spinning to be too slow to do any real exfoliating. The name brand one I have  is definitely superior- so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I am very excited about this product I love the variety of seven brush heads used for different functions.thats amazing. My favorite is the long ultra fine brush, did a great job in exfoliating my skin leaving it smooth and clean. It&#x27;s an amazing product for the price, just as effective as the other expensive types It is not water proof, so it can&#x27;t be used the the shower. It is so cute and portable,good size for travelling with. So excited to receive this product.</li>
    <li> I received my 7 in one body brush a few days ago I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! This product is easy to use and lightweight I&#x27;ve only used a couple of the attachments ( the ones for the face) and I love how they make my face feel. I&#x27;ll be trying the pumice stone next! Can&#x27;t wait because sandal season is upon us. Let you know how that works out. Oh yeah,  quick  delivery</li>
    <li> Absolutely  my favorite  I couldn&#x27;t see washing my face and doing my facial routine without this product  it makes it so much more easier then doing with hand it makes you face feel super soft and moist not dried out and irritated  it&#x27;s super soft on your skin I absolutely  love this&lt;br /&gt;(cons) -not water proof so cannot use it in shower&lt;br /&gt;(pros) -super soft on skin does not feel rough or make skin feel irritated</li>
    <li> This was  a purchase for my son who has acne. It is good for cleaning his face but wish it was stronger.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive cleansing system is just as good as my Olay Pro X cleansing system and it comes with more cleansing tools. This 2 speeds facial and body ultra brush comes with 1 crude polish accessory: To rip the tough skin and cutin off, 1 latex soft sponge: To massage eye and cheek, 1 makeup up sponge: To massage and clean your skin, 1 rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging, 1 short soft brush: To clear up all the scurf clings on the surface of your skin 1 long ultra-fine brush: To better clear up and exfoliate skin, 1 pumice applicator: For filling and smoothing rough callous skin, you willl need 2 AA batteries they aye not included. The quality of this cleansing system is very good and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap it&#x27;s light and great for travel. I was hook after the first time I tried it my skin looked and felt clean, smooth, soft, brighter and my pores looked smaller.</li>
    <li> This brush get&#x27;s the job done but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;First off you can not get the handle wet or it will no longer work. You would think that something like this would be waterproof, this brush is not.&lt;br /&gt;One of the bristle attachments is a little rough and feels like it is scratching my face but the other bristle attachment is really soft and feels like it is cleaning very well. I have been using this brush over a week and I can feel some improvement in the way my skin feels. For a cheap brush it is not bad, it does what it is supposed to. I like that it comes with several other attachments. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try any of the others but the little sponge ones feel really nice. All in all I would say this product is worth the small amount of money you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*will add photos when I find my camera charger!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial massager, it is a good addition to my beauty routine. I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to safely exfoliate my face and this is the answer. The brushes are soft enough against my skin as to not scratch it but effective enough to slough away dead skin cells. I use multiple products on my face daily and just washing my face alone does not always remove everything, using the massager helps make sure my face is clear of residue. After using this for the past week, I&#x27;ve noticed the my skin&#x27;s texture improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massager is easy to use, just pop in the two AA batteries (not included) and then choose the tool you want to use. The grip is nice, it&#x27;s not slippery and I have good control. I&#x27;ve been primarily using the brushes but I have also used the soft one to massage around the eye area and the pumice stone attachment. It is not water resistant though so do not use in the shower. This is a good affordable option and I recommend it if you are in the market for something like this and spending upwards of $100 is not in budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a review but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to test this product out.  It is fabulous.  I love the interchangeable heads and all the different options.  I feel like I have been to the spa after using it.  I would highly recommendedecommed this to anyone looking to pamper themselves.</li>
    <li> Love the different attachments it comes with. It does seem, though, that the motor might not be as powerful as I&#x27;d like. Doesn&#x27;t come with batteries. but that&#x27;s not a problem. I will be using it a lot and hopefully will last me quite some time.</li>
    <li> Works good but my daughter didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> This PIXNOR brush is everything that it peomises to be. It ha 7 different pieces of massaging heads. Replacing them is super easy and comfortable because they attach with such smoothness when you change them. This PIXNOR brush uses 2 AA Batteries, but they are not included. The design is very well made for your hand, so it&#x27;s easy to navigate and keep control of this brush while you use it.</li>
    <li> Works great I notice a diffrence in my skin already.It has cleared my acne up in just a few short weeks.</li>
    <li> I really love my PIXNOR Facial Brush and its attachments! My skin is combination oily and dry and sometimes it really hard to thoroughly clean the oily areas without irritating the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful little brush system allows me to get a deep clean without irritation. There are seven rotating heads in all each with a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The pumice massager is perfect for elbows, heels, and feet.  It smooths but doesn&#x27;t scratch. So nice!&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks:  It does require batteries (AA) but doesn&#x27;t include them and it should have a case for protection and portability but one is not included.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Pixnor Facial Brush set for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own and based on my own use of and experience with the item.</li>
    <li> This pixnor portable 7 in 1 was amazing, it makes  your face clean n soft compare to others. It&#x27;s all 7 in 1 all what u need to clean n wash ur face r there..it all complete.</li>
    <li> This massager is great, my face feels so soft and relaxed. It requires 2 AA batteries and works fine with rechargeable&#x27;s. The directions are very easy to follow as to what head to use for each treatment including picture of head to match with directions. It felt wonderful to use and made my skin feel so soft and clean. Great product and I look forward to each use of it. The brushes are amazingly soft and enjoyable to use. It is really good after you come from a long hard because gives you a relaxing feeling while it cleans away all the dirt and oil you built up through out the day.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical on buying this because it&#x27;s cheaper compared to the facial brushes I see in store but to my surprise I got in love with it!! I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 days now and my face never felt so clean! The brush is soft and gentle yet it really cleanses my pores! Even my husband&#x27;s using it now! Would definitely buy this again and even recommend it to my friends :-)</li>
    <li> This is so worth the money. Why spend hundreds of dollars on a facial cleaner that does not work when the real deal is a fraction of the price????</li>
    <li> Works very well! Cleanses and exfoliating results are amazing! I would definitely recommend it to friends! I wish I had found this sooner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I suffer with adult acne &amp; this product allows me to clean my face better &amp; more completely. The different head attachments go on with ease &amp; stay put during use. I will totally be recommending this product to my friends &amp; family.</li>

    <li> i love this brush! the different attachments are so good. the facial brushes the massager  is noisy but relaxing and the pumice is nice. it has two settings that is a nice feature only the high setting isn&#x27;t really that fast. i wis hit would go faster for when i&#x27;m using the pumice. it got here quick and the box was packaged really nice</li>
    <li> I have used the portable cleaner and it is very good. as a portable  device I think it works well and I have used other devices and it is not a plug in model so the device has less power of course but I travel and it is perfect to take with me.  If you want a good grooming device this one rocks! considering the price, you will love this one!</li>
    <li> Love this facial brush.  It is small and portable. It has 7 different heads for all different type of cleansing needs.  It works just as well as much more expensive brushes I have tried. It works well to exfoliate my skin and remove make up.  My son uses it for acne and it really helps his skin. I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Pros: Compared to the pricey one this one will do the job! You don&#x27;t need to press hard on it when using it! very cool color and less expensive. Cons: some head has stiff sharp bristles compared to what I use now.  in general good massager/face brush with great price  I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This product just won&#x27;t stay together.  The pieces are cheaply made.  Not something I would buy again or recommend</li>
    <li> i love this product and it works so well on my face</li>
    <li> This product is what i have been looking for. There are so many other products that are like this one and have broke after one use, I was excited to get and use this product I have used this product on my face and on my feet and it has worked great for me i am very happy with this product this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by how it look&#x27;s. I just dont like the speed i think that it could spin a lil faster.</li>
    <li> A good alternative to the more expensive brands.  Brush head is not as large but that didn&#x27;t bother me</li>
    <li> I love this Pixnor brush! It comes with every attachment you would ever need. Left my face so soft, it feels like silk.</li>
    <li> The Facial and Body brush arrived in good condition and as described on product page.  We received this product at a promotional discount to sample and review.  The advertised price of $12.99 is very fair, and the brush is compact and lightweight enough to travel with.  The rotation is good at the higher speed, but not really strong enough at the low setting.  I am very careful when using, as it is not waterproof.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using one of these facial Brushes for you face. I have to say that i been using it for a whole week now and i really like it. I uses it at night before i go to bed. It leaves my face so nice and smooth not Oily at all.</li>
    <li> There is so much you can do with this. Its great to do a deep clean on your skin a couple times a week. ITs a must have.</li>
    <li> This is an great tool. You can use it on your feet and face. I used it on my feet to remove callouses. Which it did with no problem. The only problem is the instructions.  I feel like they could of explained more. Like what type of cream you can use with each tool if any. And it should of came with batteries.</li>
    <li> i love this beautiful thing. this comes with 7 attachment it  is very easy to switch to which attachment you would like to use.Every single head piece does something different so be sure to read the manual it comes with that shows the picture of the piece and what it does.My favorite of the attachments is the rolling massage, a 4-bead circular roller that really feels nice as it massages and tones the skin and it stimulates blood flow i feel i am at the spa every night. my husband also love it he can use other attachment for his feet. i really love this product. its not water resistant so we have to be careful using this in the bathroom. over all im loving this product highly recommended.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Any opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> I cant believe how amazing this product is its super soft on the skin works great with my facial wash and scrub and makes it so much easier to wash. My face and makes it so much softer i didn&#x27;t want to put this down it felt so nice against my skin and it comes with a variety of tops love this its amazing i definitely recommend this is you have a facial routine this makes it so much better. Love this.</li>
    <li> I love how this efoiliates my skin, love the choices of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting purchase a product like this but most I see online are expensive. I was so glad to found this product without spending so much.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the sponge scrubber to take of my make up. It was gentle but very effective at the same time. I uses the brush 2-3 time a week exfoliate. Perfect to use before I put my serums and cream on my night time routine.&lt;br /&gt;The massager was fun to use. I&#x27;m not sure if it works but knowing my face muscles are getting massages makes me feel good. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other stuff that comes with it.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this little face &amp; body brush/scrubber tool device.  She&#x27;s constantly using it to primp.  It&#x27;s quite fascinating to see someone get attached so quickly to something.....wait, I am attached to my home entertainment remote myself.  Anyhow, she uses this quite a bit and has commented on how much she likes it.  She&#x27;s always using it to remove makeup, for facial massages, callous remover on her heels, etc.  I think she&#x27;s used ever attachment that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is made quite nicely also.  Feels well built and sturdy.  Her biggest compliment is it&#x27;s portable.  She&#x27;s not tied to cord to use it.  That makes it much easier for her to use anywhere.  Has a nice assortment of attachments with it also.  I recommend picking up a good set or two of rechargeable batteries for this.  Seeing as it takes AA batteries, you&#x27;ll probably go thru quite a few.  I picked up an 8 pack of quality rechargeable batteries and a charger for it so she&#x27;s always able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone, great little product with plenty of uses.  The ladies will definitely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price to provide my fair and honest opinion.  This is my opinion based on testing and reviewing the item.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is perfect to help keep my face pores small and help keep me looking younger.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item for all those ladies out there. This is really easy to use and feels so good. The build quality is outstanding and the build quality is great. Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this Face and body brush.  I feel like my face gets cleaner using this brush, then it did using a similar brush by Mary Kay.  And this one has 7 different brush heads!  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is awesome I love it! Great on the face! I am excited to see what the difference in my skin is after a few weeks of using this!</li>
    <li> Amazing ship time. Wasn&#x27;t sure the quality would be there with this item but am extremely pleased. I used it the first day I received it and am hooked. The seller had great communication too. I look forward to purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I ike using my Pixnor Body and Face tool. My favorite ways to use it is with the pomus-type feature to get my heels less cracked and also to be able to add moisture. I have fairly good skin now that I have finally had my baby so I want to keep it this way. I have seen the Clarisonic models and the Pixnor is right on par with those. It doesn&#x27;t come with batteries included, but that is an easy fix. The design fits well into my hands. I like to use this weekly with my facial masque and also in the morning with a little bit of cleansing serum. It works well and it&#x27;s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount with purchase. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Love the item. It help to reduce my my pimples, makes my skin smooth and clean. Its so easy to use the only thing is it consume AA battery fast. Overall great deal.</li>
    <li> I have never had a facial massager but now I&#x27;m sad I dave not gotten one sonner!! I love all the different attachments that some with this pixie massanger! They are easy to change out but sicure enough to stay on while on the machine!! It is super easy to use and all it takes is 2 AA batteries!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice little piece of equipment.  It is very easy to use and works great.  Definitely recommend this!</li>
