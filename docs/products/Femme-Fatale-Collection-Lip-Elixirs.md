      <li>The flavor and scent are both really nice  </li>
      <li>also purchased the Salted Caramel flavor, which smelled really nice.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to purchase this lip balm after seeing a good review for it in Nylon magazine.</li>
      <li>My favorite of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>so I get more kisses :)</li>
      <li>okay with that</li>
      <li>I used to smoke cloves, so the clove cigarette flavor was appealing.</li>
      <li>I was given the clove cigarette for my birthday and love it.</li>
      <li>The tin is adorable, and generous.</li>
      <li>Yes, its mostly petrolatum #1 ingredient, Im</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
      <li>The fragrance and flavour are both very true to the name of the product.</li>
      <li>Smells great and keeps my lips soft.</li>
      <li>I am a huge Tokyo Milk Lip Elixir fan, I&#x27;ve never met a pot I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>and she said that this one, the pear one, and the cherry one are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Squeezing the top though I wasnt sure what that really meant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Dark Salted Caramel - Mildly sweet, a bit warm, pleasant, does smell caramel-y.</li>
      <li>It took me quite a while to open the dang thing, but once I got into it and put it on, I wanted to chew my own lips off!</li>
      <li>I was extra happy that I got it for such a good price.</li>
      <li>...theres nothing remarkable enough about the product that makes the aggravation worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!</li>
      <li>so you get your moneys worth.</li>
      <li>When used like the smooth texture and amazing scent, but has absolutely no flavor.</li>
      <li>I love the gloss, just not the hassle of getting the tin open</li>
      <li>This was a gift, and I&#x27;ll use it up, but won&#x27;t be going back for more.</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE Tokyo Milk fan, always have 6 or 7 bottles of their fragrance on the go, tubes of their hand cream everywhere...and  back-up on Dead Sexy because it always sells out....</li>
      <li>so she can easily get it open.</li>
      <li>Its not obviously mis-shapen but The lid isnt easily re-closing -</li>
      <li>The tin is also large and contains alot of the product</li>
      <li>The salted caramel lip elixir is the one that I sought first because it&#x27;s not a common lip balm flavouring.</li>
      <li>All in all, I love this line of lip balms, it was worth the frustration to get it open, the smell is glorious and I would definitely buy this flavor again.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of Vaseline type lip balm, you might really like this.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read the reviews more carefully, because another reviewer already mentioned that it was basically just Vaseline with scent.</li>
      <li>Finally i figured Id drive a nail into the top of the tin and push it open, but first I banged it about 7 times with a can of vegetables (my instrument of choice</li>
      <li>consistency is really goopy and sticky, which wasn&#x27;t so nice when my wool scarf got windblown onto my face and and left little fibers glued all over my lips.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new fave lip balm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very minor inconvenience, really, as I&#x27;ve never found a lip product more moisturising than lip elixirs.</li>
      <li>This is yummy, pure and simple.  </li>
      <li>I even left the tin open on a high shelf near my ceiling fan for a few days, hoping some of the odor would become milder and more bearable.</li>
      <li>pretty decent otherwise, moisturizing, thicker than the average  &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; and tastes yummy.</li>
      <li>but it does smell pretty much like clove gum, if a bit stronger and more artificial.</li>
      <li>That said when I opened the box and took out my other items, right away I was washed over with a wave of Salted Caramel aroma.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s such bs for a high priced lip balm...</li>
      <li>Somehow when I closed the little tin, it formed some kind of seal and since then it has required much bashing and poking with sharp things to dislodge the lid...</li>
      <li>i should at least be able to open it when I want.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve barely used it and the tin is battered and scratched and whenever I pull it out of my purse people avoid eye contact in case</li>
      <li>This leaves your lips feeling so soft, so moisturized and the scent lingers for a long time.</li>
      <li>in all, I think in the future I&#x27;m abandoning the Dark Collection and sticking with Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Bon Bon line of lip balms, which have very different ingredient lists, texture, and smell ever so much nicer, even if the container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> It feels exactly the same on the skin (which is to say, thick and rather greasy) and works just as well.</li>
<li> It smells heavily and tastes like salty caramel when you FINALLY can get the tin open.</li>
<li> So the packaging shouldn&#x27;t need beatings or extra instruments in order to be opened; it&#x27;s just a little different from other lip balms because the tin is so flat.  </li>

<li> For those of you not familiar with the Tokyo Milk Dark Collection products, this is essentially a petroleum jelly-based with various other oils and extracts thrown into the mix.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;d recommend sticking with plain Vaseline or the generic equivalent.</li>

<li> Dark Smoked Salt - This just smells VILE.</li>
<li> not that im going to force it down.</li>
<li> So hands down, that was the selling point here.&lt;br</li>
<li> This would be 5 stars hands down if the container was easier</li>
<li> (Vitamin E) acetate, stevia rebaudiana (Stevia) leaf extract, organic camellia sinensis (Green Tea) leaf extract, carthamus tinctorius (safflower)</li>
<li> I tried using a thin knife to open the tin-</li>
<li> The tin is generously sized, although it can be difficult to open until you get the hang of it--pressure applied to the sides to pop the lid off</li>
<li> Which usually isn&#x27;t a problem, but now it will take me forever to use it up.</li>
<li> If you find it too thick, try heating it with a hairdryer if you can, it melts it a little and makes it easier to apply and not as thick seeming.</li>
<li> It is very hard to get the lid off this product.......</li>
<li> I blame this on the petrolatum - bad stuff in my opinion.</li>
<li> Taste nasty reviews wrong</li>
<li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <li> This lip balm/gloss is so yummy I could eat it with a spoon - if I could ever get the tin open after the inaugural opening! Somehow when I closed the little tin, it formed some kind of seal and since then it has required much bashing and poking with sharp things to dislodge the lid...I&#x27;ve barely used it and the tin is battered and scratched and whenever I pull it out of my purse people avoid eye contact in case I ask them to open it for me...I am a HUGE Tokyo Milk fan, always have 6 or 7 bottles of their fragrance on the go, tubes of their hand cream everywhere...and  back-up on Dead Sexy because it always sells out....</li>
    <li> Tokyo Milk is taking over our house!!!  Some of the scents give me a headache, but some of them are really unique and beautiful.  I asked my daughter what she thought of this lip gloss and she said that this one, the pear one, and the cherry one are fantastic.  She thinks the pear one is Absinthe and the cherry one is Cherry Bomb.</li>
    <li> In my experience, the lid of lip elixirs should be squeezed in order to open the product. So the packaging shouldn&#x27;t need beatings or extra instruments in order to be opened; it&#x27;s just a little different from other lip balms because the tin is so flat.  The salted caramel lip elixir is the one that I sought first because it&#x27;s not a common lip balm flavouring. The fragrance and flavour are both very true to the name of the product. Though with all lip elixirs wiping it off glasses/mugs is a must because the wax content will not be washed off by a dishwasher cycle. It&#x27;s a very minor inconvenience, really, as I&#x27;ve never found a lip product more moisturising than lip elixirs.</li>
    <li> For those of you not familiar with the Tokyo Milk Dark Collection products, this is essentially a petroleum jelly-based with various other oils and extracts thrown into the mix. The tin is generously sized, although it can be difficult to open until you get the hang of it--pressure applied to the sides to pop the lid off should do the trick. It does not screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about the scent, this will be overpriced for you and I&#x27;d recommend sticking with plain Vaseline or the generic equivalent. It feels exactly the same on the skin (which is to say, thick and rather greasy) and works just as well. If you do care about the scent, well, I&#x27;ve found the Dark Collection to be a very mixed bag. I&#x27;ve bought and tried three so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Salted Caramel - Mildly sweet, a bit warm, pleasant, does smell caramel-y. My favorite of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;- Clove Cigarette - I&#x27;ve never had a clove cigarette but it does smell pretty much like clove gum, if a bit stronger and more artificial. Took some getting used to, but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed now and don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Smoked Salt - This just smells VILE. It&#x27;s awful. I even left the tin open on a high shelf near my ceiling fan for a few days, hoping some of the odor would become milder and more bearable. I still can&#x27;t stand it. This one&#x27;s going in the garbage. I can&#x27;t even stand to keep it around to use on my heels, it smells so repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think in the future I&#x27;m abandoning the Dark Collection and sticking with Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Bon Bon line of lip balms, which have very different ingredient lists, texture, and smell ever so much nicer, even if the container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list: petrolatum, microcrystalline wax, flavor, canola oil and aloe barbadensis (Aloe vera) leaf extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), tocopheryl (Vitamin E) acetate, stevia rebaudiana (Stevia) leaf extract, organic camellia sinensis (Green Tea) leaf extract, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil and jasmine officinale (Jasmine) flower extract, monarda didyma (Bee Balm) leaf extract.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to purchase this lip balm after seeing a good review for it in Nylon magazine. I used to smoke cloves, so the clove cigarette flavor was appealing. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully, because another reviewer already mentioned that it was basically just Vaseline with scent. The tin is adorable, and generous. Which usually isn&#x27;t a problem, but now it will take me forever to use it up. I&#x27;m hoping after it&#x27;s gone to reuse the tin for a craft project of some sort, as it is pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Salted Caramel flavor, which smelled really nice. I think both flavors are a bit over priced for what they are. If you&#x27;re a fan of Vaseline type lip balm, you might really like this.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to an addiction to salted caramel and paid a fortune for it. When used like the smooth texture and amazing scent, but has absolutely no flavor. Would definitely not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Tokyo Milk Lip Elixir fan, I&#x27;ve never met a pot I didn&#x27;t like. That said when I opened the box and took out my other items, right away I was washed over with a wave of Salted Caramel aroma. So good I could eat it! The balm itself is slightly thick, but it is very long lasting, and the flavor dissipates sorta quick, but I can&#x27;t complain about that at all. If you find it too thick, try heating it with a hairdryer if you can, it melts it a little and makes it easier to apply and not as thick seeming. The only con to this was, the tin was darn near impossible to open. I tried wedging three different knife points along the seam to force it open and it would not budge. I bought a second one in the same shipment, and I ran into the same problem, would not open. I was giving one to my ma, and I didn&#x27;t want her to have the same difficulty, so I tried using a thin knife to open the tin- putting a dent in it, but I finally got it open. She can&#x27;t close it all the way, otherwise we&#x27;d have to go through the same thing all over again. So she has the lid cockeyed so she can easily get it open. All in all, I love this line of lip balms, it was worth the frustration to get it open, the smell is glorious and I would definitely buy this flavor again.</li>
    <li> Taste nasty reviews wrong</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! This stuff smells and feels amazing!! Definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on promised day, sealed and perfect. Thanks for the happy!</li>
    <li> I love Tokyo Milk perfumes and lotions, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the &amp;#34;lip elixer&amp;#34;. The flavor and scent are both really nice  (I have the salted caramel flavor), and I&#x27;d say it falls somewhere in between a balm and a gloss for functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is really goopy and sticky, which wasn&#x27;t so nice when my wool scarf got windblown onto my face and and left little fibers glued all over my lips. I blame this on the petrolatum - bad stuff in my opinion. This was a gift, and I&#x27;ll use it up, but won&#x27;t be going back for more.</li>
    <li> Im a junkie for salted caramel everything. So hands down, that was the selling point here.&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty decent otherwise, moisturizing, thicker than the average  &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; and tastes yummy. The tin is a beast to use and I constantly have to ask for help from the SO to open it. I will likely depot into something else to use.  This would be 5 stars hands down if the container was easier</li>
    <li> This stuff is delicious and smooth as can be. Perfect for fall...plus my boyfriend loves it so I get more kisses :)</li>
    <li> It is very hard to get the lid off this product.......I love the gloss, just not the hassle of getting the tin open</li>
    <li> about the balm. Yes, its mostly petrolatum #1 ingredient, Im okay with that but if you aren&#x27;t, dont get it. It smells heavily and tastes like salty caramel when you FINALLY can get the tin open. I recommend immediately putting it in another container. Because you will Never Get it open again. I tried everything I googled 1. Squeezing the sides. 2. Squeezing the top though I wasnt sure what that really meant. 3. Putting rubber bands around top and bottom and turning merely broke the rubber bands. 4. I got a metal file and put it in the opening, a tack, a fork, open scissors 4. And tried a pair of pliers. NOTHING WORKED! Finally i figured Id drive a nail into the top of the tin and push it open, but first I banged it about 7 times with a can of vegetables (my instrument of choice when a hammer might be too damaging) on the side and it popped open. Its not obviously mis-shapen but The lid isnt easily re-closing - not that im going to force it down. I might re-purchase if its miracle balm that cures my ever-chapped lips since I nos know how to open it, but if you havent gotten it yet, I&#x27;d save yourself the headache...theres nothing remarkable enough about the product that makes the aggravation worth it.</li>
    <li> This is yummy, pure and simple.  I love the scent, and it feels so good on my lips.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps my lips soft.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss I already own and it is AMAZING. BUT, I purchased this one as a gift and ot never arrived. I was refunded...I think, but I don&#x27;t know what happened!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this after reading the reviews on it....this stuff is completely amazing and smells delightful. I was extra happy that I got it for such a good price. I know this will last me quite a while. Thank you for the prompt service.</li>
    <li> This leaves your lips feeling so soft, so moisturized and the scent lingers for a long time. The tin is also large and contains alot of the product so you get your moneys worth. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even get it open to try it!!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t tacky or sticky. My husband keeps threatening to steal it from me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the actual smell.  3 stars instead of 1 since that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I was given the clove cigarette for my birthday and love it. It&#x27;s my new fave lip balm. Am eager to try the others elixirs in the dark collection.</li>
    <li> It took me quite a while to open the dang thing, but once I got into it and put it on, I wanted to chew my own lips off! I love it! I would give it a five star review if it was easier to open. UPDATE: I tried to open it again to put it on, and it was completely impossible, so I beat it open with a big ladle, and left a message with the company. That&#x27;s such bs for a high priced lip balm...i should at least be able to open it when I want. GRRRRR.</li>
