      <li>it&#x27;s great, but if you&#x27;re looking for something spectacular, spend more $.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush kind of pounds against your teeth a bit.</li>
      <li>This does not seem like a sonicare and my daughters teeth were cleaner when she had the plug in charger kind.</li>
      <li>A friend had purchased the battery powered version and liked it</li>
      <li>nice price , and 2 battery plus</li>
      <li>This brush vibrates alot - very strongly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to review a toothbrush to make it sound wonderful and interesting, but here goes!  </li>
      <li>it was a suitable replacement.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to know how many cycles constitutes an Ultrasonic Frequency.</li>
      <li>We always found we liked the AA battery powered ones better so that there was no fear of recharging on vacation or anything like that, but I found that I wanted a better brush and bought upgraded to the Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Toothbrush about a week after I got this one.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping - thank you!!</li>
      <li>The head is huge!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Philips is going to have to do alot more to convince me to buy their sonicare product again.  </li>
      <li>Still, the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; rechargeable Sonicare is light-years better.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>or [[ASIN:B00G5L867C Sonicare Kids]] toothbrush, and definitely better than drugstore models like Crest Spinbrush.    </li>
      <li>I have another rechargeable Philips Sonicare brush at home that I love.</li>
      <li>The orig way better</li>
      <li>You can probably buy a Jenna Jameson Pocket Rocket vibrator, attach a toothbrush to the end of it, and get a better cleaning than this</li>
      <li>Nowhere to be found is the sonic technology that made Sonicare famous.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had it die on me in the many months I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
      <li>I love Sonicare brushes and have for decades.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I used these toothbrushes while traveling and really enjoyed them.</li>
      <li>Indeed, I ended up (since I was on the road) trying a number of toothbrushes and just settling on the Oral-B pulsar as more satisfying to use and brush with vs. this teeth-rattler.  </li>
      <li>It seems to wobble around more while the ultrasonic vibrates sided to side.</li>
      <li>I knew it would be more of a vibrating brush rather than a sonic-type brush.  </li>
      <li>Its great, I really like it.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
      <li>and I love that there are no cords.</li>
      <li>and i think this works better  </li>
      <li>This brush is as great as my main brush at home, without the charger.</li>
      <li>Works just as good as the higher priced ones.</li>
      <li>I just got it, and so excited wanna try it immediately, but it didn&#x27;t work!</li>
      <li>It is OK, just vibration is strong.</li>
      <li>Brush head is so huge, i think oral-b is better.</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT, JUST WISH I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SOFT BRISTLES.</li>
      <li>Received as described, fast shipping, good price.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, energy saving.</li>
      <li>After one year the power is not that strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Again, I really liked the product, it works much better than a normal brush.</li>
      <li>Probably fine for kids.</li>
      <li>Works fine with rechargeable batteries.</li>
      <li>For PowerUp, I have to admit Philips did a fine job in improving the battery compartment.</li>
      <li>light weight,powerful and efficient.</li>
      <li>begins the search for a sonic toothbrush that takes replaceable batteries, and is not planned to break with cheap plastic door retaining clips.</li>
      <li>Both Colgate and Oral-B make brushes that feel as good or better than the HX3631, use only 1 AA battery, and are available in either disposable versions or versions with replaceable heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been discontinued and this is the closest thing available.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this toothbrush for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>brush is like sticking a vibrator in your mouth, and a cheap one at that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the more powerful battery operated ones I have tried.</li>
      <li>Fortunately the AA battery operated unit was designed with the functional obsolescence of battery door clips that break off (I&#x27;ve already owned 3)</li>
      <li>+ brushes whose cheap NiCd batteries become unusable with battery memory effect in about 8-14 months.</li>
      <li>the heads arent cheap</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cleans plaque off beautifully. Easy to operate even for a child older than 5. It seems to be gentler on gums than my other Sonicare brush, which I love for the results but not for the vibration. The handle is a little bulky, but all good ones have bulky handles; must have something to do with technology needed for the quality brushing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush refill for my eSeries Sonicare, battery powered.&lt;br /&gt;Found THIS Complete Unit for half the price of three Sonicare eSeries brush refills.  Brought the Powerup home and powered up.  The brush vibrated so violently that my mouth and lips were numb in 10 seconds.  I drooled like a baby or like an old man on heavy medicine.  I did not like the experience and put the brush in a sack to return to the store.  Ordering a proper eSeries refill from Amazon, now.</li>
    <li> Quit after 8 weeks. Didn&#x27;t like it much anyway; was very loud and too rough.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive works great for traveling</li>
    <li> I guess for the price it&#x27;s ok, but it won&#x27;t feel or work the way the more expensive brushes will. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. It&#x27;s no better than the toothbrushes sold at the store! This does not seem like a sonicare and my daughters teeth were cleaner when she had the plug in charger kind. Waste of money and now I have to buy a plug in charging type.</li>
    <li> I just got it, and so excited wanna try it immediately, but it didn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;m so disappointed! And i check everything even I changed new battery, so still didn&#x27;t work! What can I do? Hope seller can contact me as soon as possible. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good as a travel Somicare.</li>
    <li> nice price , and 2 battery plus&lt;br /&gt;my wife love it very much</li>
    <li> Battery died in about a month&#x27;s time but my teeth definitely feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> The effect is also good, affordable</li>
    <li> I have used many different electric toothbrushes over the years. This particular model cleans teeth very well for its price... almost as well as several low-end rechargeable Sonicare models, such as a [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Sonicare Essence]] or [[ASIN:B00G5L867C Sonicare Kids]] toothbrush, and definitely better than drugstore models like Crest Spinbrush.    Though this brush gives me clean teeth, there&#x27;s one thing I really don&#x27;t like about it, and that&#x27;s the strength of its vibrating motion. This toothbrush shakes like crazy, sometimes to the point where I actually can&#x27;t keep the sides of the head from whacking into my teeth! Overall, this toothbrush does the job, but I&#x27;d rather my toothbrushing time be a little more relaxing and peaceful. A Sonicare Essence costs more than twice as much, but is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I travel a lot.  I&#x27;d given up on my trusted Sonicare rechargeable for travel and went back to an old fashioned toothbrush - why carry the weight if it&#x27;s dead at the end of a week?  A friend had purchased the battery powered version and liked it so I tried it.  Love it!  Not as heavy as the rechargeable, if the batteries die, no problem, replace em.  Fits the same replaceable brush heads, makes it very convenient.</li>
    <li> Yeeks!  I bought this sonic care purely because it was cheaper than the one I am replacing.  My perception is that the skinny part of the brush is shorter than the one I have.  The problem is when I attempt to brush the inside of my teeth, the back side of the brush bounces violently off my other teeth.  At age 45 I cannot risk a chipped tooth!  This brush has much more wild movement &amp; much less sonic (possibly no sonic) than my former sonic brush.  I cannot recommend this brush to anyone.  I have reordered a different model.</li>
    <li> Brush head is so huge, i think oral-b is better.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s loves her Sonicare tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My husband and I used these toothbrushes while traveling and really enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> This works great and I love that there are no cords.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that happy about it. The brush is small...good size for a child&#x27;s mouth but not an adult. The brush vibrates but does not move or &#x27;brush.&#x27; Just vibrates. I have to spend a bit of time getting to all my teeth and cleaning my tongue because the brush is not adult size and the brush is too soft.</li>
    <li> yeep~ it&#x27;s worthy to buy。</li>
    <li> worst toothbrush ever. vibrates too much that it hurt my teeth. don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this.</li>
    <li> First powered tooth brush.  Talked with various coworkers who have rechargeable and replacement battery brushes.  This is the best value.  I&#x27;ve been using daily for over a month and batteries still going strong.</li>
    <li> One star because it works and one because it doesn&#x27;t suck...BUT it is loud and vibrates your hand and jaw. If you are a radio listener while brushing your teeth forget it with this one...and if you hit a tooth with the hard side you may break a tooth</li>
    <li> It is OK, just vibration is strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple Sonicare brushes in the past that were well over the $100 mark and this one is going toe to toe with them.&lt;br /&gt;You have to understand that the biggest thing that the more expensive brushes have going for them is the brush stroke rate per minute; this brush is 15k per minute while the expensive ones are double the speed. For me it is like saying that a 20 megapixel phone is better than a 16 megapixel dslr, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense because both these brushes won&#x27;t substitute a routine plaque cleaning twice a year but both of them will maintain healthy teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment is water tight and I use it in the shower without any problems. Also the fact that this brush operates on batteries means that I am in control of the charge (versus a more expensive induction charger base that exploded on me recently). A fresh set of AA&#x27;s will last you for about 5 months with regular, twice a day use.</li>
    <li> This should come with a water disclaimer. I bought this for my younger daughter and after just two weeks of use it stopped working. Thinking that perhaps the batteries that came with it were dead I decided to start there and change them. Upon opening the battery compartment I discovered why it was not working. The compartment was wet and the batteries were corroded. I tried cleaning it out and letting it dry and putting new batteries in but still not working. My daughter doesn&#x27;t submerge the brush but the handle does sometimes get wet when she washes the toothbrush off after use. Very minimal water contact actually. You would think a toothbrush of all things would be designed with water in mind?!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for me and one for my husband. We went from the old AA powered Sonicare (Got that one for like $29 at Target a few years ago and LOVED it) to this one when we felt our old ones were too worn down to do the job. I found that this one rattled my teeth so much that it almost tickled my nose when I brushed my teeth. It wasn&#x27;t terrible but it also wasn&#x27;t good enough. We always found we liked the AA battery powered ones better so that there was no fear of recharging on vacation or anything like that, but I found that I wanted a better brush and bought upgraded to the Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Toothbrush about a week after I got this one. My husband still uses his but I could get used to the rattling in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the preliminary electric toothbrush. Brush cleaner than handbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The powerup battery is useful in one year. After one year the power is not that strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought 2 of this. For people who have not used electric toothbrush this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Nice for travel and work, small enough to keep in your desk - good for popcorn days.  Quick shipping - thank you!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is more violent than I care for.  Your whole body shakes with the brushing and if you accidentally hit a tooth with the wrong side of the brush - game over.</li>
    <li> I like this brush because i feel freshness in my tooth...</li>
    <li> Cleans very well.. Impressed with the cheap price.</li>
    <li> very pleased with the item and the price!!!</li>
    <li> like it smaller than my other one</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was great, while it worked. Unfortunately after less than a month, there is some sort of internal short that causes the motor to stop if any pressure is applied to the brush head. Have tried new batteries without any luck. Again, I really liked the product, it works much better than a normal brush. I really hope I just got a lemon, I will be contacting Phillips for a warranty request.</li>
    <li> gets gunky, other than that can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Worst toothbrush ever!! It kept hitting up against my teeth which really hurt. The brush head is very small and handle is  too short so when you do you back teeth it&#x27;s awkward. Don&#x27;t like the way it vibrates your whole mouth. Also has no cover for brush head and handle is huge and heavy.. Should have stuck with my oral B which I will go out and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Replaces a Braun Oral B, seems to get places the Oral B could nots.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dentist recommended.  Seriously, my dentist recommend this brush to me, and I like it a lot.  My teeth definitely feel cleaner than manual brushing, and I can feel it getting in between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that if you run the back of the head against your teeth it can be jarring.  I would agree.  So I don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have braces and so I have to brush my teeth 4-5 times a day - as such the batteries only last me about 3 weeks to a month.  I figure I brush at least twice as much as most people so I would imagine you&#x27;d get twice as much battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 4 stars as far as electric toothbrushes go.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive Sonicare models and they are definitely better, but I don&#x27;t think you can beat the price for this model.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever! !! Super clean like from the dentist.  I love it</li>
    <li> Vibration sound is not very big，it is very suitable for beginners.</li>
    <li> Good brush but a little noisy</li>
    <li> Longtime Sonicare user. Much prefer E series action to the Powerup. The power up brush has massive vibrations from the handle to the brush tip. Feels inefficient....might reduce battery life? Great price point and way better than manual! I believe there is a 90 day unconditional warranty?</li>
    <li> This is a very strong tooth brush, much stronger vib than the cheap ones.</li>
    <li> Good product. Personal preference: came with medium brush which is not firm enough for me. Purchased regular brushes separately. Wish they had a different package that came with regular brush.</li>
    <li> I like the vibration, feel, and cleaning advantage to this tooth brush however it does not clean at the gum line between teeth well at all. thanks</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolute garbage. It vibrates so hard that my whole head is vibrating. A total waste of money. One star is too much.</li>
    <li> I lost my battery-powered e3000 Sonicare (model 3351/02) while traveling, so I picked up the HX3631 from a local department store.  What a massive disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It noticeably vibrates a lot less than the earlier, now discontinued, e3000 model and much less than the models with the built-in battery.  It feels more like it&#x27;s rattling your teeth out, rather than actually cleaning them.  People who say they can&#x27;t tell the difference from the more expensive models have either not tried the more expensive models or they&#x27;re flat out lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made the Sonicare stand out from the Oral-B and other cheaper brands was the quality and number of vibrations per second; this brush just feels like any other ordinary electric toothbrush.  Indeed, I ended up (since I was on the road) trying a number of toothbrushes and just settling on the Oral-B pulsar as more satisfying to use and brush with vs. this teeth-rattler.  As soon as I got home, I sought out the discontinued e3000 model  and paid a lot more than its original $21 price because it&#x27;s worth it for the increased vibrational power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HX3631 on the other hand is not worth the price.  Yes, it  has a few pluses:  the battery compartment has been improved over the e3000 model.  The replacement brush heads are cheaper and available in bulk packaging vs. the more expensive e-series.  It&#x27;s smaller than the e3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the lesser number of vibrations means that competitors have caught up.  Both Colgate and Oral-B make brushes that feel as good or better than the HX3631, use only 1 AA battery, and are available in either disposable versions or versions with replaceable heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Sonicare had kept the number of vibrations the same as the earlier AA model, this would be easily a 5-star brush.  Instead, they&#x27;ve replaced the e3000 with an effectively weakened version which relegates it to the same or lower level of cheap competitors.  Shame on Philips.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Good brush. The vibrating action is really powerful. If a solid part  of the brush touches your teeth, you can feel it in your skull. I hope it does not take out any fillings. Overall I am very satisfied after a week.</li>
    <li> Works great.  No problems, great for travel.</li>
    <li> It is like using a Dremel Tool to brush your teeth, not like my E-series Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid it will knock my crowns off.&lt;br /&gt;Is it even ultrasonic? It seems like it has a electric motor inside.&lt;br /&gt;I know it is low cost, but I trusted Philips Sonicare Products, not anymore though.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor quality, will definitely not last. Only has one year warrantee, E-series has two year warrantee.</li>
    <li> love this  had a very expensive cousin  of this and i think this works better  only downside  the heads arent cheap</li>
    <li> I have a Phillips Sonicare Extreme. I wanted a spare so I bought this&lt;br /&gt;thinking it was a suitable replacement. It isn&#x27;t. The brushes work much&lt;br /&gt;less rapidly and the cleaning action is much less complete. The Extreme&lt;br /&gt;is entirely equivalent to the ones with built in battery that one charges.&lt;br /&gt;This Powerup isn&#x27;t. It is inferior in all respects. I want a battery device&lt;br /&gt;as I do a lot of travelling. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush lasted only five months.  Worked well for the first 4 months.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item, try another brand.</li>
    <li> I wanted a battery version of the Sonicare that you can replace with regular/rechargable AA batteries. The built-in batteries in other Sonicare models are what always seem to prematurely fail. I owned a Philips Sonicare HX3351/02 that used AA batteries and loved it. They&#x27;ve been discontinued and this is the closest thing available. It&#x27;s not a worthy replacement. This model tarnishes the Sonicare reputation. It&#x27;s rough, uncomfortable, and sounds like you&#x27;ve put a power tool in your mouth. It feels like it&#x27;s going to explode in your mouth. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought three of these for my kids, and they all stopped working within two weeks. Cannot figure out why- possibly water got inside them. Inexpensive, but possibly for a reason. Cannot recommend them. Usually we may have an issue with one item due to usage, but all three was odd.</li>
    <li> Ugh.  This is a very poorly designed brush.  I&#x27;ve heard about &amp;#34;sonicare&amp;#34; for years, and decided to finally try one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is obviously designed to mimic a traditional brush, and you are supposed to brush  similar to how you brush with a regular tooth brush (saw up and down in gentle circles).  This brush vibrates alot - very strongly.  I like the vibration, but because of the large brush head, you constantly bump your teeth on the plastic.  The vibration + tooth on plastic hurts.  It feels like bumping your tooth into heavy glass cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips is going to have to do alot more to convince me to buy their sonicare product again.  Why would I 60-200 dollars on a brush, when a similar looking $10 brush is a pain to use.  Coating the neck + brush head in a soft rubber would probably fix this (a COMMON FEATURE on many manual brushes!).</li>
    <li> Received as described, fast shipping, good price.</li>
    <li> Been using Sonicare for years and very happy with their products.  Bought this battery powered at the same time I got the regular one.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with the other at just 1/4 the cost.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive Sonicare. The orig way better</li>
    <li> works perfect, i want to buy more for my family</li>
    <li> I have owned Sonicare Essence and Healthywhite before I moved to OralB since the brush head is much cheaper but I still have some ProResult heads. For $10, and I check from Sonicare official website in Q&amp;A section &amp;#34; can be used with ProResult brush head. &amp;#34; So I ordered one, opened the box, put ProResult head on. It won&#x27;t fit. So it&#x27;s not compatible.&lt;br /&gt;  It the past I use Essence both rechargeable and battery version. The battery version was work as well as the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;  For PowerUp, I have to admit Philips did a fine job in improving the battery compartment. Unfortunately it end there. It term of brush function. It is a shame for Philips to use Sonicare trademark. It is nothing come close to where Sonicare stand for it product quality. It just vibrates. That&#x27;s it. The vibration is very forceful. It left after brush discomfort sensation to my root canal tooth. I rather throw away $10 than visit my dentist to fix my tooth.  It does not give clean teeth sensation normally get from Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;  This is my fourth Sonicare brush handle so I have no idea why people gave this PowerUp 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;PS I just discarded HealthyWhite and Essence handles at city household hazardous facility not long ago.</li>
    <li> I have another rechargeable Philips Sonicare brush at home that I love. This brush is as great as my main brush at home, without the charger. Perfect for travel, camping, and international trips in which fiddling with charger and power adapter is the last thing you&#x27;d want to deal with.</li>
    <li> These are great. I wanted a sonicare that I didn&#x27;t have to charge because I don&#x27;t like the cords. I keep it in the shower but I have a regular one on the sink.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.  Needed battery operated one.  Works just as good as the higher priced ones.</li>
    <li> Good enough for me to have purchased five brushes.</li>
    <li> It does the job...  For the price it&#x27;s great, but if you&#x27;re looking for something spectacular, spend more $.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, energy saving.</li>
    <li> Best powered toothbrush on the market.  Period.  Only downside is you have to remember to put the paste covered brush head in your mouth before you turn it on.  Trust me on this.  Otherwise your wife will make you clean off the bathroom mirror and all the tile.</li>
    <li> As others have said you may get a headache using this toothbrush. It does in fact rattle my brains a bit. It&#x27;s one of the more powerful battery operated ones I have tried. However I have no doubt that it performed well. It&#x27;s so far the best battery toothbrush I have used based entirely off of results.</li>
    <li> This is this first battery powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I spend a little longer making sure all my teeth have been brushed more thoroughly. Perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s no effort to use. But when I&#x27;m done my teeth feel a  whole lot cleaner. At this price you should get this product. I know someone who paid a hundred dollars for one that doesn&#x27;t do any better job, and I can&#x27;t see it lasting longer than this one.</li>
    <li> Ultra-disappointing product! Definitely not a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush. It&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent in noise, harsh vibrations, etc. of the cheap mechanical toothbrushes you can buy for $5.99 at any pharmacy. Definitely not the equivalent of Sonicare&#x27;s real sonic toothbrushes? That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so inexpensive. Product description should make this clear, but does not!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  So large it felt like a shovel in my mouth.  Hated it from the first second.  Might be just spoiled after using the diamond brush for years.</li>
    <li> Love these. I get great reviews from my hygienist every time. Perfect inexpensive way to get into the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat these heads good factory quality</li>
    <li> Does not work since l don&#x27;t have a printer l can&#x27;t get refund or replacement</li>
    <li> good, sorry my English is poor.cannot describe more.</li>
    <li> I love Sonicare brushes and have for decades.  Sadly, I broke my Sonicare about a month ago (I accidentally drowned it). I have been using a back up manual brush for about a month (ugh) because I have been too busy to think about it outside of 6am when I leave for work and 11pm when I am heading off to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I had the right expectations when getting this brush.  I knew it would be more of a vibrating brush rather than a sonic-type brush.  The pricier Sonicare brushes vibrate at different, faster, quieter speed.  You almost don&#x27;t see the bristles move.  This thing is like a diesel semi.  It&#x27;s loud and is, frankly, like a jackhammer for plaque (not in a bad way).  I could do with a much quieter brush though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the perfect travel Sonicare (so I don&#x27;t have to pack my charger!) and much better than any other battery operated brush I&#x27;ve ever tried.  For those who can&#x27;t afford the higher end Sonicare brushes, I would recommend this brush. I would also recommend it as a travel brush since there is less to pack than a traditional Sonicare. Still, the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; rechargeable Sonicare is light-years better.</li>
    <li> best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever found</li>
    <li> Works great!  This was a replacement for another by same manufacturer.  This was cheaper and works every bit as well as the pricier ones.</li>
    <li> Love it,, works great polishes my teeth ..</li>
    <li> Use the head shaking.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare HX3631/06 Powerup Battery Toothbrush, Medium was rather disappointing. I found the motor noise very loud, my husband could hear it downstairs and thought I was drilling holes into the wall. The vibrations are very rough and the drawback to the noise and hard vibrations is that I wanted to QUIT brushing as fast as I could, to eliminate the loud sound and the harsh pressure on my teeth. The final frustration is the size of the bristles.,..they remind me of the toothbrushes I bought my kids when they were toddlers. The brush head is so small, that I found I had to move across my teeth several times...like brushing my teeth with a toddler brush. I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B Pulsar 3d White Advanced Vivid Soft Toothbrush and in my opinion it&#x27;s much better. Less noise, right pressure on my teeth, and good brush size.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist. Was pleasantly surprised with how it worked, the value, and how it made my teeth feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for nearly 2 years and it&#x27;s still my favorite. The price can&#x27;t be beat and I&#x27;ve only had to change the batteries about twice a year. The replacements can seem a bit pricey, but they still cost a lot less than a more expensive electric toothbrush when this one works just as well. It is a bit intense and uncomfortable to use at first, especially if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush, but I got used to it within a few days. My teeth and mouth overall feel so much cleaner using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have received my Philips Sonicacare in mail, through Amazon.com LLC. It is not turning on after taking out from its cover. I am also not able to figure out about how to contact the seller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to review a toothbrush to make it sound wonderful and interesting, but here goes!  I got this toothbrush for my husband, who brushes way to hard, in hopes that he will give his poor gums a break.  So far he is brushing longer and lighter.  His teeth look much whiter and his gums are getting the break they deserve.  He says that he can really feel the bristles get to the way back with ease.  Small head work well for way back tooth cleaning.  Very nice brush and it is accomplishing everything I had hope it would.</li>
    <li> Very good use of the toothbrush, is love.</li>
    <li> To buy his son, son like, get on</li>
    <li> My apologies,I honestly think this item is great.I have already recommended it to a few of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for the quick delivery I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This model seems to not be an actual ultrasonic toothbrush. The bristles move fast, don&#x27;t get me wrong but, not like my rechargeable Phillips Ultrasonic model. It would be nice to know how many cycles constitutes an Ultrasonic Frequency. Still, it cleans my teeth better than expected. I have to give it an OK rating as I was expecting the high frequency vibrations of the Phillips Ultrasonic model.</li>
    <li> Wanted the equivalent of an electric toothbrush but cordless.  Did not expect batter powered to be anywhere near as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as electric but it is indeed.</li>
    <li> Do not think for a minute that this is the replacement for the Sonicare Essence battery operated toothbrush that was sixteen bucks and now is going for over a hundred dollars since discontinued. That toothbrush was at least a sonic toothbrush. This is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is like sticking a vibrator in your mouth, and a cheap one at that. It is a SLIGHT upgrade from a six dollar Crest spin brush. The entire unit vibrates and attempts to offer a sonic clean which it fails at miserably. Nowhere to be found is the sonic technology that made Sonicare famous. You can probably buy a Jenna Jameson Pocket Rocket vibrator, attach a toothbrush to the end of it, and get a better cleaning than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, Sonicare has REALLY gone down the tubes. Replacement brush heads are nowhere to be found, and they finally created a AA battery replaceable sonic unit for under $20 and discontinued it. Probably after realizing that it was a firm competitor to their $100+ brushes whose cheap NiCd batteries become unusable with battery memory effect in about 8-14 months. Fortunately the AA battery operated unit was designed with the functional obsolescence of battery door clips that break off (I&#x27;ve already owned 3) so all units will fail eventually and save their more expensive product line... WHEW for them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now begins the search for a sonic toothbrush that takes replaceable batteries, and is not planned to break with cheap plastic door retaining clips. Hell I&#x27;d pay $40 or so bucks for a rechargeable unit with Li-Ion batteries that would last for at least 2 years. But apparently that alien technology is nowhere to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, add another junk heap to my $1000 box of broken Sonicare units which I&#x27;ve been foolishly buying for the last 15 years. Some day I&#x27;ll learn.</li>
    <li> Not the same one I ordered a couple of years ago.  (That one increased in price 10-fold.)  This one was listed as a substitute.  Ordered this for husband to have at lake home.  The toothbrush head is small (child like) and the worse thing is that it does not come with a cover.  Also, it takes a different toothbrush head than the E-Series replacements we have.  Would not have ordered if I had known.</li>
    <li> this is a good toothbrush if you have a large mouth and want to have your whole head massaged at the same time!  The head is huge!  Why do companies have to discontinue things that work?</li>
    <li> good toothbrush for the money</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush for the price I paid. Every time I finish using it my mouth feels sparkling clean. Great value and a great purchase!</li>
    <li> Great brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> excellent toothbrush, gave to my girlfriend and she loved it. Says her mouth fees really good after using it.  I think its a very  good toothbrush for the money.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than a regular brush but doesn&#x27;t compare to even the least expensive ultrasonic brushes. I bought an HX3300 battery power a few years ago (similar to the current essence model) and it stopped working with rechargeable batteries, so I picked this up. The brush speed is noticeably slower (about half that of the 3300) and it vibrates more in your mouth than the 3300 does. I don&#x27;t like the feel of it on my teeth. It seems to wobble around more while the ultrasonic vibrates sided to side. This toothbrush kind of pounds against your teeth a bit. Not nearly as comfortable as the untrasonics. Probably fine for kids. Works fine with rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT, JUST WISH I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SOFT BRISTLES.</li>
    <li> Stop working after three weeks. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> So worth it. Clean teeth</li>
    <li> I use to get another one of the Sonicare brushes but that model would die 3 months in. I found this and this brush is cheaper than the one I was using before. This one works just as well and I haven&#x27;t had it die on me in the many months I&#x27;ve had it. Very well worth the money.</li>
    <li> too shaky. not comfortable when the back of brush touch your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this toothbrush gets great reviews. This literally rattles the teeth out of my head. I read that someplace else and didn&#x27;t believe it due to the overwhelmingly good reviews - but you should believe it. I can&#x27;t believe this replaced the HX3351/02 which was equivalent to the plugin version. This should be in the power tools division for breaking up concrete or advertised as a method to get compulsive brushers to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- extremely uncomfortable to brush your teeth. I could barely get through one cleaning because of the discomfort from the violent vibrations&lt;br /&gt;- the frequency of the vibration seems much lower than the HX3351 which seems to contribute to the rattling effect&lt;br /&gt;- the motor seems weaker in that when pressed closer to the teeth the motor audibly slows down which makes me wonder if over time it&#x27;d wear out more easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- battery operated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - Avoid buying this</li>
    <li> I have had two Sonicare brushes over a 10 year span.  This would be my third.  This is not like my prior ones.  The prior ones (even the cheaper $30 non-rechargeable one) oscillated only the head, and the frequency was so high it caused water and toothpaste to foam up.  They worked very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is just a vibrating toothbrush.  If feels like they just stuck one of those cheapo vibrator modules on it that they stick on razors and every other thing on the planet these days.  The frequency is quite low and the whole thing vibrates (not just the head) which wastes energy.  I do not recommend this brush if you are coming from better Sonicare brushes as you may be disappointed as I am.  I am surprised Philips would even put the Sonicare name on this brush as it cheapens the brand.</li>
    <li> Had an electric Sonicare that died on me. I find this one much easier to maintain and use and carry with me. Price and shipment perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth brush I ever owned...light weight,powerful and efficient. I have had other toothbrushes but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Works great and better than having a charger sitting out due to the battery power operation.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Powerful at a low price!</li>
    <li> Its great, I really like it.  It came with two batteries, so it was ready to go as soon as I received it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE TOOTHBRUSH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this stupid toothbrush and I felt like I was about to pass out. I had to hold on to the bathroom door to brush for 30 seconds. If it ever touches your teeth, you will experience pain each time the back of it touches any part of your teeth. I tried using it twice but I had to quickly stop and use my other toothbrush. My teeth weren&#x27;t any cleaner after using this. My husband have the essence which is 31,000 brush strokes and way more gentle on your teeth as compare to this power up brush at 15,000 brush strokes.&lt;br /&gt;I just called Phillips at 800-682-7664 and got Angie (who stated this toothbrush is 31,000 brush strokes per minute) in customer relations dept. she stated under the 90 day money back guarantee I would have to pay for shipping this lousy toothbrush back to them and wait 4-6 weeks for reimbursement. Not only is this product bad but you want me to spend more money to get back the $14.88 I spent on it? I don&#x27;t think so!! That&#x27;s bad customer service for a bad product.</li>
