      <li>We&#x27;ve been searching for a good, natural replacement for years, and this fits the bill!</li>
      <li>By far this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used, natural or not!</li>
      <li>I certainly don&#x27;t smell all that nice when I am sweating either.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No rash since I took a week break from last deodorant, smells good, feels great and soft, easy to put on using finger tips, did notice some darkening of the skin in areas where I apply.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 2:  It&#x27;s now been over a year since my original review.  I am still using this deodorant and will not go back to traditional ones.  This still works amazingly well for me, and I have not had any rashes from it.  I have, since my original review, bought this in other scents from here as well as their website.  I tried out a few samples to see if I preferred other scents.  Jacked up Jasmine is still my favorite.  Orange Creamsicle is what I am using now and definitely my second favorite.  UPDATE:  I am now 2 months in using this deodorant and it is only 1/2 gone!!  So my 8 week estimate was way off.  This is going to last me at least 4 months!  I have been using it daily and still no irritation.  I know I already mentioned this above in my review, but I ALWAYS shower at night and wash it off and do not reapply until morning.  This may be the reason I have not had any irritation.  I never sleep in deodorant. It still works just as well as it did when I first started using it.  I used my regular deodorant (Dove) one day when I was going out of town because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with sweating really bad. Not that it stops me from sweating, but I thought it might not make me sweat as bad.  Um, never again!  I was only a few hours in and already smelled.  I also noticed that washing regular deodorant off is such a task. It leaves a film on my underarms and is sticky.  This Primal Pit Paste washes off like there&#x27;s nothing there.  I have never been this pleased with a deodorant in all my life.  This is the best thing I have ever tried.  I will be back for more as soon as this one runs out.  Original Review: This stuff really does work!  I sweat bad.  I mean really bad.  I certainly don&#x27;t smell all that nice when I am sweating either.  I have tried all different types of deodorants and antiperspirants.  Nothing works, even the clinical ones.  Regular antiperspirant/deodorant actually makes me smell worse than using nothing at all and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for sweat.  I knew this was just a deodorant so I didn&#x27;t expect it to stop me from sweating.  I didn&#x27;t mind since not even an antiperspirant does that for me.  I am more concerned with smelling nice after a long hot day.  I initially received a sample of this to try and had to come straight here and order a full size one after a few days of trying it.  I spent the weekend scrubbing and staining my deck in almost 90 degree weather.  I never expected to smell as good as I did after.  I smelled fantastic!  There was not even a hint of odor.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Nothing has ever worked this well.  I don&#x27;t know if I will experience irritation like others have mentioned.  So far I have not.  I have been using it for a little over a week now.  I shower at night and wash off all of my deodorant and do not reapply until the morning .I don&#x27;t know if that might help to not get irritation.  This is definitely worth every penny.  It is small, but you are only supposed to use a tiny bit each time.  This should last me a few months.  The sample size I have is .25 oz and it has lasted over a week now with still more to go.  So a 2 oz should last at least 8 weeks but I am betting it will last even longer.</li>
    <li> I got sick of using regular deodorant because they felt like they clogged my pores.  I am not usually an earthy, organic type but after reading about all the chemicals in regular deodorant, I decided to take the plunge and try this.  I admit, I was worried since I don&#x27;t eat clean that I would reek.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised that this smells nice and even after being out in the summer heat, so do I!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this armpit deodorant. It is vegan, cruelty and all natural. It gets me through a rigorous vinyasa yoga practice and through any other day.&lt;br /&gt;You need to apply it with your fingers, since it is in a jar in the form of a thick paste. Just take a pea size amount and spread well it on a clean and dry armpit. You will love it. I love the smell, too!!&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> An all natural deodorant that really works!!</li>
    <li> Out of all the natural deodorants I have tried this one is the best! The Lavender and Jasmine scents are my favorite. I will definitely continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t leave pit stains!</li>
    <li> Works better than Toms by a long shot!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! It saved me. I switched to natural deodorant years ago, but let&#x27;s be honest-it really didn&#x27;t work. It might work for the short-term, but I&#x27;d have to reapply several times a day. I work in an office with other people, and you can&#x27;t really just whip out the deodorant and start applying in that situation. I came to Amazon as a last ditch effort before switching back to anti-perspirant, after going to hug someone the other day and realizing too late I shouldn&#x27;t have...embarrassing. Took a chance on this based on the reviews, and SO SO happy I did. I guess body chemistry varies, and it may not work for some, but I recommend either switching to another scent of PPP, or trying their stronger version. I&#x27;m already going back to buy another one just in case I somehow lose it when traveling. I never want to be without it. I apply this at 5 am on work days, and at 6pm that night, my pits still smell clean! I just guessed when selecting a scent, but I love this one. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong. Buy buy buy!!!!   Edited on 9 August 2015-It&#x27;s rare to be able to give a product such a great review and then come back to give an even better update, but since having reviews is so helpful I felt the need. I&#x27;d originally went looking for this product when I was about to give up and go back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant. Strangely enough not long after I purchased this my husband said the same thing. And he is a sweating machine with hairy armpits. He commented on how Tom&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t work, and what was left? It told him about Pit Paste and how it worked for me. I offered it to him to try, thinking he wouldn&#x27;t want to, and especially since it was jasmine scented. I took my container back and imagine my surprise when he asked what I did with it. He said it worked! He doesn&#x27;t work in air conditioning either.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant ever! Smells really good and keeps you feeling fresh all day!</li>
    <li> Love this product I&#x27;ve tried tons of all natural deodorants this one surpasses them all</li>
    <li> Tremendously impressed with product; it has to be the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  I personally had no problems adapting to rubbing the paste to the skin instead of a more easy-to-use roll-on or stick deodorant.  Don&#x27;t let the manual application deter you from Primal Pit Paste!  I bought three different fragrances, and all are pleasant without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> After using this for a really long time I ordered another jar like usual and ended up breaking out in a horrible burning rash. Idk if it was a chemical burn or an allergic reaction. I&#x27;ve used this before plenty of times so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an allergy. They either changed their product or  have a chemical in there that causes burns.. Sucks because this was my favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great and has a wonderful, light scent. If you order this in the summer or peak of the warm season, be forewarned that it will arrive in liquid form until it cools to room temperature. Be advised that as/when it resumes solid form, it will need to be re-mixed. This is a great product. I&#x27;ll probably order in bulk next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this one is a keeper! It&#x27;s not as gritty &amp; grimey as some of the others and works to keep you odor-free and feeling fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;As with any deodorant, I don&#x27;t recommend putting on immediately after showering or shaving... it can cause some irritation. Either wait a few minutes or cool your skin with a cool compress right after shower/shave before using. Don&#x27;t rub - pat gently onto the underarm area and it will be absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> Sorry this doesn&#x27;t work. If you are into jasmine scented B.O. this is your product.</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance on this one and it lasts at least 8 hours and this is based on use on hot and humid summer days in NYC. I definitely recommend to any who is looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of deodorants and this is the only one that lasts for the whole day. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it and so far after using for a fee weeks, I haven&#x27;t had a reaction that resulted with irritated skin. By far this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used, natural or not! Will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I have been making my own coconut oil deodorant for a while now, but it&#x27;s messy in the summer so decided to try this. It works as well as mine (which is great!), but is more stable in the heat. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> My pits actually detoxed on this stuff! I&#x27;ll never go back to using any other product for sweaty and stinky pits LOL love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I have come across. It kepps me stink free all day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product but it was never properly delivered. HOWEVER, I ended up buying it somewhere else and I am still amazed by how great this works! It&#x27;s the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually works. I sweat less and no odor, no matter how long it&#x27;s been or how hot is is. And trust me, this stuff has gotten the ultimate test. It survived a 12 hour concert in the heat and humidity, it&#x27;s survived outdoor runs, gym sessions, etc. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working fine. Jar is rather small for the price</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. So far, I have tried the jasmine and lavender scents. I find that this is a natural deodorant that works well, even when working in a non-climate-controlled office on hot summer days and on long travel days.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells wonderful! My favorite Primal Pit Paste so far!</li>
    <li> It took a couple days for my body to get used to this, but after that, I love it!!! Will continue to use not only natural deodorant, but this brand. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the one we will use from now on</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I was hesitant because I am such a heavy sweater and I thought I would be still sweat and stink but I have been pleasantly surprised.  It is hard to get used to scooping it out of the little jar and rubbing it on instead of having a stick but its so much healthier for you! I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> i normally use Lavillin, which works for a week w just one application. But I never have a pleasant floral smell. This Primal Pit Paste makes me wanna eat my arm pits all up because I smell like a proper lady.. Not a robot. The following day I smell like me again.. Wish it lasted as long as my regular go to.. But this is my date night w the hubby deodorant now! :) he loves it on me ;)</li>
    <li> I love primal paste!  It holds me although I sweat and we are suppose to sweat no odor with the sweat!  I have been using primal paste for over a year now and I love it!  The lavender scent is all I use!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it kept me smelling good all day long.</li>
    <li> I have gradually been making the transition to natural, chemical free beauty and skin products, but remained wary of swapping out my tried-and-true deodorant.  I don&#x27;t want to stink. Ever.  But I also don&#x27;t want any of the scary diseases associated with aluminum deodorants.  So, I did a lot of research on the available natural deodorants (and make-your-own products), and skeptically began trying all the higher-rated brands. I found a few that, surprisingly, kept me stink free all day, Primal Paste among them. I ended up chosing Primal as my regular deodorant because it was the best priced, offered the convenience of Prime, the jasmine scent makes my nose happy, and  it comes in both a jar and stick version (I use the jar at home, stick for travel/gym).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers mention, this is not meant to be an antiperspirant.  On occasions where dryness is important, I just apply a little of their &amp;#34;popo powder&amp;#34; over the deodorant.  I have made a habit of reapplying the deodorant before workouts or nights out as well as carrying a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; disposable deodorant wipe in my wallet (from another natural brand), but I&#x27;m not sure this is necessary - it just makes me feel more confident with a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience an underarm rash, though not during the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; period, and not the typical &amp;#34;itchy red bumps&amp;#34; type.  I used a &amp;#34;pit detox&amp;#34; method I found on a crunchy website (I highly recommend a google search for said detox) before switching, which I believe helped with my initial transition/ But, after about four weeks, my pits became red and painful. After some research, I came across a few strategies that solved this issue. I now shave in the evening, use a coconut oil and tea tree essential oil mix on my puts every night, and spray a water and apple cider vinegar mix on before applying a baking soda based deodorant. I also make sure I only apply a pea-sized amount (in my quest to stay stink-free, I was using about double this recommended amount).  It took some getting used to, but it works for me.  My pits are now happy and both rash and chemical-free, and smell like jasmine.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of jasmine essential oil and that is exactly what this smells like. I particularly like that there is not a long list of ingredients in this stuff and most of them I have at home. I&#x27;m not finding myself needing anything for &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; life they mention on their website but I&#x27;ve also been using more natural deodorants for several months already. I stopped and decided to try this because the others kept giving me a rash due to the first ingredient being propylene glycol. This has actually helped soothe and heal that. I live in Texas and we are experiencing 100 degree weather with really bad humidity and I can tell you that the pea sized amount they say to use is enough. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m overly sweating (which actually reduces when you stop using antiperspirants) and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or wet feeling under my arms. By the end of the day, I don&#x27;t smell the jasmine anymore but I don&#x27;t smell BO either. If I am experiencing a little extra sweating because of the humidity,  I throw on a little body powder that also happens to be jasmine scented (a gift from lush) and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the evening. To give you an idea of time frame, I start my day at 5:30 and end somewhere around midnight. There is still no BO smell when I wake up either. Definitely worth giving it a shot though you should anticipate buying on amazon for a while because it&#x27;s hard to find locally.  **Update - I talked to Primal&#x27;s customer service and Michelle was great. I had suggested they create a body powder (like the one I mentioned that I use above) and she told me they actually do and she uses it daily herself for her skin, and also uses it as a dry shampoo in between washings. HOW DID I MISS THAT?! LOL. Definitely going to be on my next order.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have B.O!  I use to only use clinical strength high performance deodorant but trying to do what&#x27;s healthier for my body, I now only use natural deodorant... Long story short, I stink a lot! I have tried pretty much every natural brand, I had sort of settled on TOMS but I still stink through it, despite multiple applications and by mid day I have sneak away to wash my pits before I re-apply... I am happy to report that this stuff really seems to work!... Better at least... I still have to re-apply, it&#x27;s a little gross sticking your finger into deodorant and rubbing it on your pits when you&#x27;re anywhere but fresh out of the shower in your own home... I don&#x27;t really like girly flowery smells but this jasmine doesnt seem to bother me, it is a bit girly but it&#x27;s not over powering and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like some flowery scents do... My armpits do not get a rash (they have in the past with other products)... *** As  a side note, if you are switching to natural deodorant for the first time, your body goes through an adjustment period where no matter what you use, you will stink. It took me about 6 months for my body to realize I was no longer going to clog my armpit pores, but a couple years later, I find my pits and I are much happier... and hopefully less likely to get cancer!</li>
    <li> (This is Aaron&#x27;s girlfriend writing this review. We share this account) --  I am SO HAPPY I found this product. For years I&#x27;ve felt worried using other deodorants with aluminum in it just for the fact that I don&#x27;t like using any chemicals in general that can be harmful to my body. I have been using primal pit paste for the past couple weeks and I can honestly say I love it! I&#x27;ve only tried the jacked-up jasmine scent and it smells soooo good. This deodorant works well on normal days, but I will say on days that got to 95+ degrees I had to reapply, but honestly I do not mind because I know this deodorant will not hurt me in the long run like the chemicals would in a traditional commercial deodorant. On an average day, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes with a an applicator stick. It&#x27;s so easy to put on. I only need about a pea-sized amount per armpit. It&#x27;s easy to spread after it melts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try a natural deodorant because you love yourself too much to keep applying chemicals onto your skin, try this deodorant! You&#x27;ll love it :) Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This deodorant is made in Austin, TX, also known as my favorite city! :)</li>
    <li> The product came promptly and it works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly fantastic an keeps me BO free till the day is done. I am really liking it an am going to get another flavor 😉.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it, It really works.  I found that  the known brands of deodorants no longer lasted the entire day( not for me anyway) . I wanted something that lasted and kept me dry.&lt;br /&gt;This product is it. This product keeps you dry; sometimes to dry. Not an uncomfortable feeling ( did I forget)feeling  .. You just need a little  bit ,don&#x27;t go crazy applying to much.  No smears and nice scent not to much .. enjoy</li>
    <li> Its a fairly good product, but in my opinion not the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels drier than most natural deodorants&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells quite nice (Jasmine)&lt;br /&gt;3. It protects for about 1/2 day&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not last more than 4-6 hrs&lt;br /&gt;2. It can get under your nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product its sufficient, but a far superior one I&#x27;ve used in the past is a combination of the Crystal deodorant and Green Tidings natural deodorant.  I exercise quite a bit in the afternoons, and the one that protects me the most is the Green Tidings and Crystal combination.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and long lasting. I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this deodorant. We&#x27;ve been searching for a good, natural replacement for years, and this fits the bill! It is not an antiperspirant, so it took me a few days to get used to sweating more. But it smells so good (we tried Jacked-up Jasmine which, surprisingly, was a scent both &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; enough for me without being too feminine for my husband) and, frankly, our bodies were designed to sweat AND we were both wanting to get away antiperspirants, so we thoroughly expected to sweat more, as is natural to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, but not unlike normal deodorant, there is definitely a need to reapply towards the end of the day, especially if you are going out - or just want to smell good at home for your significant other! But it goes on smoothly, smells wonderful, and is free of the bad stuff. Just wish it was a subscribe and save item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* Wanted to add one more thing: I have also tried a similar product in the Schmidt&#x27;s brand (in lavender &amp; sage scent), primarily because it was a subscribe &amp; save item but also because I wanted to compare the two brands since they seemed so alike. The Schmidt&#x27;s actually gave me a little rash and made my underarm area feel very dry &amp; itchy. Never ever had that issue after nearly a month of use with Primal Pit Paste, so I&#x27;m returning the Schmidt&#x27;s and ordering more PPP! I realize some have had a similar reaction using PPP, so it must just depend on the user&#x27;s skin type and maybe the scent choices as well. I have rather sensitive skin in general though - and normal deodorants have ALWAYS given me an occasional sharp stinging sensation - so I&#x27;m not one of those folk&#x27;s who can use just about anything and never have a problem. Anyway, because of this, PPP is the superior product in my opinion, and I won&#x27;t be trying any other brands. Thanks, PPP!</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders for sweat. I live in the South and am currently a nursing mom which means my hormones are crazy making me sweat a lot. Nothing from the store was helping me until I found this product. That being said, I did have a reaction to it in that it caused a rash and itching after about a week of use. I haven&#x27;t tried the sensitive skin variation yet but I have heard it&#x27;s not uncommon to hve such a reaction from the high level of baking soda in this formula so it is definitely not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried 5 different natural deodorants. And I am so glad I found Primal Pit Paste, through the recommendation of a friend! I love the smell of Jacked Up Jasmine (though I have not tried other scents). This has a nice velvety soft texture with just a little grit that you can feel at the end of rubbing it in. I am so happy to have this now that the weather has really warmed up. Pit Paste really helps keep me dry and smelling fresh!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! It has a very smooth consistency, smells amazing and really controls odor well. Just wearing it daily, to and from work, no exertion, it lasts about 18 hours. Wearing it outdoors in the heat, while working out, etc, it lasts 6-8. That&#x27;s for me, those times may be different for you, but I&#x27;m really pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Free of bad chemicals that you don&#x27;t need and it really works.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. I previously purchased the Lavender (which I love the scent), and I wanted to have another scent to try as well. This Jasmine is nice, not overpowering. I have had no issues of being smelly, it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, these deodorants are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Not a bad product really, but for my underarms which sweat a lot I have to use more than directed, about a quarter size amount (compared to the pea sized amount that&#x27;s recommended) to mask the smell. So it&#x27;s just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product in my books.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Really works a full day but you will turn into a pumpkin at midnight. No residue, smells amazing, easy to apply. One Bottle last for months of application. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the Jasmine scent a lot, that&#x27;s my favorite thing about this deodorant. I got into natural paste deodorants about a year ago now, and I&#x27;ve tried a few... this one is one of the better ones, but I don&#x27;t like that it has coconut oil. I regularly use another deodorant (Schmidt&#x27;s), which looks to have the same ingredients, aside from the coconut oil, which is why I think the issue with this one stems from it. It&#x27;s fine in moderate temperatures, but when it gets really hot (as it has been getting this summer in DC) this deodorant melts and runs much more so that Schmidt&#x27;s, which is a bit gross...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this deodorant, unfortunately my skin is apparently too sensitive for it.  The Jacked-Up Jasmine scent is really nice, it smells like jasmine perfume but not over powering.  I wish I could use this deodorant, but after giving it a two week trial, my arm pits couldn&#x27;t handle it.  But like I said, my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for an aluminum-free deodorant, and so many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products out there do not work. Primal Pit Paste has solved that problem! I apply in the morning and stay fresh till I get home from work, including sometimes taking a mid-day Barre class. My boyfriend also uses PPP and is thrilled with it. He called it the &amp;#34;breakthrough of the month&amp;#34; when we discovered it. My favorite scent is Jasmine; he orders a more manly scent. Thank you Primal Pit Paste--great product! I am hugely relieved that I&#x27;ll never again have to use any aluminum-based, chemical-laden deodorants now that you have delivered an exceptional alternative.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have never found a deodorant that has worked on my very intense body odor.  I can now go about a day and a half without any smell.  I even convinced my very skeptical husband to try it and he was shocked at how well it worked.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the application (I only used the stick once, I prefer to just use a finger), love the feel, love everything!!  I especially love that it works really well!!! If I had to complain about anything, it would be that at the Farmers Market there was a hornet that wanted to come love it too :-)  He realized I wasn&#x27;t a flower and took off eventually :-)</li>
    <li> I received my product on time, but unfortunately, a part of the lid had broken off and the paste was oozing out in the bag that held it.  Super disappointing.  I may try ordering again or will look to see if any store near me carries it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months through summer in North Carolina.  I&#x27;ve been hesitant to review it because it just seems too good to be true.  I sweat a normal amount but can smell quite a bit.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants and have been disappointed in all of them so I just gave up.  I won&#x27;t use antiperspirant but had begrudgingly settled on SpeedStick deodorant as the only thing that would work.  AND THIS WORKS BETTER!!!  Not only does it manage to keep the odor down better than SpeedStick (and even through the hot NC summer, I&#x27;ve only had to reapply it a second time in the same day maybe two or three times), it somehow really keeps the wetness down, too.  I&#x27;m really impressed and am totally sold.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s a great alternative to traditional deodorant.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I got the Jacked-Up Jasmine scent and love it. Previous natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried have a funny scent to them, making me feel like a hippie wearing them, but this one was perfect for me. I also like the texture of this one; it&#x27;s pastey, not hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint would be that, at the time of purchase, they didn&#x27;t make this scent in a roll-on so it still requires application using my hands, which is a little awkward.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is pleasant. The finger tip paste amount is enough to last over 8 hours. The paste gave me a little rash for a few days on my left armpit. My right armpit was great.  I find it weird that one of my armpit likes it and the other find it too harsh. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product.  I will continue using this on my right armpit.  The left armpit will soon adjust -- hopefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy  this product again and again. Best natural armpit deodorant EVER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant!!</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a lifetime battle with underarm products.  First with anti-antiperspirants that would leave me smelly and dry.  Then with traditional deodorants that would intensify any odor I had.  Yeah, nothing has ever worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT this stuff is DOPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell.  If I have to reapply after sweating it&#x27;ll neutralize.</li>
