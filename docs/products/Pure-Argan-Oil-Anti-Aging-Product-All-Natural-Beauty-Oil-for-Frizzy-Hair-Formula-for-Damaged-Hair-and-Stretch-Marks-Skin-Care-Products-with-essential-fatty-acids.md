<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LUVE WHAT IT DOES FOR MY HAI.R. SO GLAD MY BEAUTICIAN TOLD ME ABOUT IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Hair Oils to replenish natural moisture in my hair. I&#x27;ve tried all the major brands, but disliked the consistency or smell of some. This product definitely delivered the three things I was looking for: consistency/smell, effectiveness, and cost efficiency. One of the things that bothered me the most on other brands was a &amp;#34;too-thick&amp;#34; consistency, but this one is just right. It&#x27;s clear and smells great. It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; where it just feels like water. It is thick enough to stay in, without giving the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling. It was very effective and did what I wanted it too. It kept my hair moisturized, smelling great, and gave it a natural bounce. The last thing that is wonderful, is that it delivers a high-end finish, just like the other major brands, but a wallet-friendlier price that I am more willing to pay time and time again. You can tell that quality development went into this product to give customers what they deserve without a huge price point. I plan on buying this again. Part of the success of hair oils is continuing to use the product again and consistently, to get your hair looking its best. I highly recommend this product. Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced price point to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> A great conditioner to apply on damaged hair. A bit hard to rinse but other than that is a great hair product.</li>
    <li> I used to buy hair shampoos and conditioners with Moroccan Argan oil. But I have never tried Argan oil on hair and skin. This oil had very delicate and gorgeous smell. The bottle is big enough to use it on hair as well as skin. I really like that the pump is included, so you can use the oil without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Oil on my hair before washing it and then apply to the ends, while i&#x27;m drying hair. It helps ease the frizz and seals cuticle to make my hair absolutely smooth and shiny, without making them greasy. For the face, I mix a few drops of Oil with my evening lotion and it works magic. The skin feels incredible soft and looks more tight. I also apply Oil on my hands for overnight treatment. It works much better, that hand creams, that I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Product!</li>
    <li> So far I have only used it a little in my daughter&#x27;s hair. It has brought back the luster and shine. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for more shine to their hair.</li>
    <li> I am admittedly an argan oil addict. When this was offered to I passed on it twice because i have reviewed many of these this season. Then on the third offer it just seemed to grab my attention and i am very happy it did.  It came super happy and is in a brown bottle which I love. It has a pump which is super easy to use with my arthritic hands. I like this much better than a dropper, which actually surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;I put some on my hands to smell it because some of them have a very strong manly smell. This one has a very lite interesting smell.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbed into my hands and cuticals much faster than most, i suspect because it seems to be thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Be cause it is thinner I added some to my dry roots and then sucked it up immediately&lt;br /&gt;of all the argan oils I have tested, this is by far my favorite so far..</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have no dry skin, no stretch marks and it smells awesome! I love the product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is NOT too oily or a overpowering smell. We have extremely dry air, so I have tried a lot of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;products and never found one that worked as well as this. Highly recommended  for everyone you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can use twice a day DON&#x27;T Forget night time it work wonderful</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used Argan oil for about a year now. I absolutely love it. My hair is not as damaged, and it feels and looks healthier. I usually use a tiny bit on the ends before I blow dry and/or use any heating tools. I use it even when I am not drying out my hair. I love this product and I recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle no good</li>
    <li> high quality oil that keeps my hair moisturized. It is also helpful as a heat protectant before I blow dry or flat iron my hair.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil works great on frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves it! She can&#x27;t believe how it improved her hair. She likes that she can use it on her body as well.</li>
    <li> As someone that is obsessed with Moroccan Argan Oil I was super excited to receive this in the mail!! After testing this Moroccan Argan Oil by Natural &amp; Organic Beauty I have to say I really love this oil!! This Moroccan argan oil works wonders on my hair &amp; skin making them look &amp; feel amazing!!  Moroccan argan oil has many amazing benefits including recovering and repairing of hair from dry frizzy hair to moisturize problems!! Moroccan argan oil hydrates your hair and skin leaving it radiant and beauty. Moroccan argan oil also acts as a safeguard for your hair &amp; skin by protecting it for aging by improving the appearance of wrinkles and inflammatories!! Argan oil also presents an exceptional percentage of essential fatty acids, one of which is linoleic acid aka omega 6, the most essential of all!! This omega 6 ensures the functions of repair and defense of your hair and skin!! I personally use argan oil a lot and look how it makes my hair and skin look and feel after using it!! I would definitely recommend this Moroccan Argan Oil by Natural &amp; Organic Beauty to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I thought this oil was of good quality and has been really helping out my hair. It has made my curls more defined and less frizzy. Will buy again when I need a refill- a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I received my bottle and the cap had come off of the bottle, in the box, during shipment. Not only did the cap come off, but the nozzle was broken off of the bottle as well. The entire inside of the shipping envelope was SOAKED in oil. I couldn&#x27;t even read the packing slip! There was no point in returning it, 1/2 of the oil had leaked everywhere, but I can still use what&#x27;s left in the bottle. I order from Amazon all the time, i&#x27;m a very dissapointed by this shipment.</li>
    <li> Best product for dry, curly hair like mine.  Makes it smooth, non-frizzy, and way less prone to breakage in the hot summer.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product for my hair, and I was surprised at its double use for skin!  Two in one for a great price, I love it!</li>
    <li> This product really is exciting.  Not only has it brought my hair back to life it feels great on my skin and has reduced the signs of wrinkles around my eyes.  My hair is damaged and dry and after using the Moroccan argan oil I have noticed a big difference, no more dryness and the friziness has all but disappeared. My mum commented on how tired my eyes look but after using this wonderful oil I no longer look I haven&#x27;t slept in weeks.  I was also suprised at the value for money that this product offers.  I would definetly recommend this to anyone wanting to try something new and actually get results! What are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> So long to dry ends!  My hair was so dry and frizzy and the product really brought it back to life.</li>
    <li> If you have grey hair you know the struggles for keeping it moist and looking like your hair but as we know medications place a part in that as well. To me this is one of the best of the best in resolving the problem of dry hair. I know I have bought so many products and they just don’t work but with one application I got a lot of the look for my hair. For anyone who has not tried or seen the benefits of Moroccan oils you are in for TREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adlsdeller gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> WOW- this stuff is amazing! I have very long, very thick hair and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try this Argan Oil sooner! It has made such a difference in my hair. I take care of my hair and it looked pretty good before, but it looks so healthy and shiny and silky now! It holds a curl better and I have absolutely no split ends. I used to notice ALOT of broken hairs on the rug after I combed it, and now none. Zilch! And I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; as much as I used to, either. This is a very light oil, absorbs instantly and smells really good. My hair never looks oily or greasy, even when I use it 2 days in a row without washing it. I will never go without this stuff again! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  I love it.  I decided to splurge on Moroccan argan oil as I have liked it in the past in cheaper shampoos and conditioners.  I thought spending a little more would be even better and I was right.  I am addicted to this line now and use it on my hair and face every chance I get.  I noticed my wavy frizzy hair was a lot less frizzy and had a more lustrous, shiny look plus the fine wrinkles around my face seems to be more evened out.  I guess the oil gave me a certain glow and my sisters have commented on my skin and asked what product I have been using.  I plan on surprising them with this for their birthdays (as they are twins).  Great great product.  This is a worthy addiction to have as it makes your hair and face so much healthier.</li>
    <li> I had never used this or any oil on my hair until now. I have dry and damaged hair from all the years of coloring. Some shampoos and conditioners make it worse or oily. Trying this I was a bit nervous as how it would turn out. After using it on my hair and it feeling and looking full of life and feeling smooth, I washed my body with it and helped with my dry skin. So glad I now have this as my washing routine. I received this product for a discount in exchange for my 100% honest opinion</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I had dyed/bleached hair for a long time ands it was very dry and straw-like much of the time. I started using Argan Oil daily and now, it is gorgeous and so healthy that a salon stylist told me my hair was in the best shape of anyone she&#x27;d ever seen who bleached it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is the best product for my hair, ever! Try it! You will love the results!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough Argan Oil to use because I love argan oil for my hair and skin. So when I was offered this Moroccan Oil from Natural &amp; Organic Beauty for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I was thrilled to try it so I ordered a bottle immediately!! The moment it arrived, I used a little on my hair.  I used it after I washed my hair. I just use this all the time and I love it!! It smells great which I think is why I want to use it on my skin too. If you are looking for a great Moroccan Argan Oil, I definitely recommend this one from Natural &amp; Organic Beauty.</li>
    <li> I have tried other hair and skin products that claim to work wonders, so I was naturally a bit skeptical when a friend suggested I try the Morocco Argan Oil Hair &amp; Body Serum. Well. I not only liked the smell, but the way it softened my hair and left my skin feeling nourished and supple. I like the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural without any alcohol, which only makes my skin feel tight and itchy. I have to be outside often and applying the oil to my skin before I go out has helped in reducing dryness. After using the product on my hair before washing, I could definitely tell a difference in the texture and it even looked like I had more hair volume. I also like the fact that I&#x27;m getting a lot of bang for my buck - a skin and hair product in one. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have a long dry hair, and I use the hair strainer alot, in the winter my hair is frizzy, and in the summer it is just dry, and this product is a life saver for both seasons, really recommend it  2 -3 drops a day and the hair looks amazing</li>
    <li> This works great to help tame frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Moroccan Argan Oil is a terrific product that I like for its silky texture on my skin and the smooth feel on my hair. My daughter presented me with a supply as she knew i had used Argan oil before. It has given my hair a healthy, shiny, silky look and my skin is so smooth that I am the envy of my friends who ask, &amp;#34;What are you using on your hair and skin? They look great.&amp;#34; This is the best Argan Oil I have encountered. I recommend the product highly.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product. This has got to be the best Argan Oil I have found so far. Such a professional and streamline product. Love the packaging and design as well</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like advertised. The bottle is not the same as the photo. The label appears possibly to be made on a home printer. The description online is misleading. Perhaps the ingredients are 100% organic, but it is not 100% argan oil. &amp;#34;Ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane Dimethicone Cyclomethicone Argana Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil) Linseed (Linum Usitassimum) Perfume D&amp;C Yellow-11 D&amp;C Red-17.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle came with cap taped on and no screw-on cap or pump underneath. Oil had leaked everywhere! And there is no way to pump it. Very smelly and disappointing.</li>
    <li> The bottle is not like the one on the pic. Only the box is the same as in the picture.</li>
    <li> My wife has used a lot of different Moroccan Argan Oil based hair treatments over the years and this is one of the best one&#x27;s she has brought home yet.  It smells a lot better than some of the cheaper versions and this stuff actually works so it is a better value in the long run.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend as a gift and she says she is loving it. She has thick course hair and she says she uses it often.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome.  My daughter uses it on her hair and it keeps her hair moisturized for her natural hairstyles, her hair no longer looks dry and damaged.  Within the last 30 days her hair looks as though it has even gotten thicker and its more manageable.  She says..&amp;#34; Oh this has my hair on fleek!! Mommy you need to keep a steady supply of this for me.&amp;#34;  FLEEK MEANS ITS AWESOME, IT WORKS IT LOOKS GOOD!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but you have to know that it is not pure argon oil. With that said, it works great on my wife&#x27;s hair. I recently went lobster hunting and my skin started to peel so I used it and have healed up pretty nicely. The delivery could be improved for future upgrades. A pouring spout may be better than the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> My hair is very frizzy and curly. This is one of the only products I&#x27;ve ever used that has actually tamed my hair and made it look and feel better. My frizz is reduced dramatically, nearly disappeared. My hair looks and feels so soft and shiny! I have dark red hair and it just reflects so beautifully in the sunlight when I use this product. This moroccan oil has become a staple product for me! I use it nearly every single day. I have had people stop me, both strangers and people I know, asking what products I used on my hair to make it look so shiny and beautiful! That speaks volumes on how amazing and effective this product is! It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily or greasy at all! It gives it a natural, absolutely beautiful shine. Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I can tell a huge difference in my hair immediately and long term. My hair is healthier since I began using this product! I would highly recommend it! I think it&#x27;s great for your scalp and hair. You can even use it on your skin! It&#x27;s safe enough for children to use as well. My niece has such pretty little ringlet curls that just  bounce and shine will brilliance thanks to this moroccan oil! It will amaze you! I did order this during a promotional period for observation purposes. After careful and close examination, I have concluded that this is a 5 star product that I absolutely cannot live without!</li>
    <li> I already use argan oil on my unruly hair, and was very excited to try this brand. The odor is very pleasant- soft, a little sweet, and not overwhelming at all. The formula is a little thicker than the oil I am currently using, and I love that. I pump about 3 pumps of this oil into my hands, then smooth it over my hair about an hour before I shampoo. I apply 2 more pumps to my wet hair, then blow dry. My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy, and feels silky. I was concerned that this thicker formula would weight my hair down, but it didn&#x27;t. It still had bounce and body, but looked so much healthier. So far, this is my favorite brand of argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great product, use sparingly as you need just a little bit.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s likea fine, serum.SHINee, light fluffy hair, and dewy skin.useful and inviting, Ragnarok room itself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Now that I know it&#x27;s a fast shipping item I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> as stated above, I love Moroccan Oil. use religiously</li>
    <li> This product works great on my dry ends.  The little dispenser part on the top, the white part with the hole in it, keeps falling off the container, but the product is great.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> my hair loves this product!!</li>
    <li> It works great is all i can say!</li>
    <li> absolutely fell in love! i was very apprehensive at first, because my skin tends to get very oily, and the last thing i would want to do is grease it up more. boy was i surprised! not only was the smell a very pleasant one (kind of like baby oil), not cloying or overpowering, but it really did the trick. the bottle it came in is glass, and the whole package is interesting and impressive. i put it in my hair before washing last night, and i could feel it when i lathered up. i woke up with extremely soft, happy hair. after washing my face the last two nights, i&#x27;ve put it on, and instead of being greasy like it&#x27;s been with the weather warming up, it&#x27;s maintained an even balance. VERY important to me!! i was at a job fair earlier today, and the room was very hot. to my great satisfaction, i wasn&#x27;t a drippy mess, my make up stayed perfect, and i could walk around with confidence. that&#x27;s worth it to me! and the best part? it only needs a few drops to work. this bottle is going to last me a long time! i received it at a discount for my honest, unbiased review, but i will definitely be spoiling myself with this again. very, VERY pleased!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised that this product was in a glass bottle. My friend had told me that only real Argon oil comes on glass because it breaks down in plastic so I was pleased to find this out! Is working in my hair very well. Makes my hair silky and smooth. I have been applying to mostly my tips and to smooth out my fly aways. Also, it smells GREAT! Overall very pleased and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Given all the rage about the ever so popular Argan Oil, I was eager to try the Moroccan Argan Oil &amp; Body Serum. When my box I arrived, I was nicely surprised to find a 100ml bottle with a separate pump and both a screw on top and a shiny gold top. The alternate tops make it a great travel oil, and offers the consumer an option to pour or spray the oil. I put mine together and spritzed some on the back of my hand and massaged it in. I could feel and see the softening/hydrating effect and I was delighted to find that it was non-greasy. I tried some on my face and my face took on a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;I was curious to see how it would feel on my hair. Again, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, I followed the directions and applied some to my hair; massaging the oil in from the roots to the tips of my hair. About an hour later, I shampooed it and felt/saw a noticeable difference in the softness and radiance of my hair. I expect to see even more improved results as I work my way through my generously sized bottle.  Moroccan Argan Oil &amp; Body Serum has a delicious, delicate smell that enhances the experience of using this excellent moisturizing product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This oil is just fantastic! When I ordered through a fantastic deal to test it and give my honest opinion I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I originally ordered to use it on my hair but discovered that it also does wonders to my skin! I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and body and is doing wonders! I have very dry elbows and they are healing and getting soft with the use of this oil. Smells really nice but not overpowering and the bottle is just darling with a nice label design. It is organic so I am using it with confidence. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to use this Moroccan oil by Natural &amp; Organic Beauty. It comes in a very easy to use pump bottle. A little goes a long way. I have dry and fine hair and I apply a little bit after I shampoo my hair and it really conditions my hair without weighing it down. The oil is also very nourishing and keeps my hair healthy and shiny. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For many years I believed that shampoos, conditioners, and other hair treatments were all the same...just in different bottles. How wrong i was. After many years of buying cheap stuff i decided to look into a better product for shampoo and skin care. i have tried a few but so far have not been too impressed...My friend had bought some of this Moroccan oil and was raving about it. She let me use hers and what a difference! I am sold! This is the only product I will be using from now on</li>
    <li> Great tool to add to my beauty care regimen!</li>
    <li> Love what this does for me!</li>
    <li> Seems like an okay product. I don&#x27;t like the pump. I was under the impression it would be more of a spray rather than a straight line stream. I have biracial daughters and i thought for sure this would be great for their hair. I didn&#x27;t get any noticeable difference with their hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Although it may work great for others hair so you may want to give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I love Argan oils, and this one is really nice.  love using on my face, hands, and hair.  great product, would recommend!!</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff.  I made fun of her for it, until one day she decided to attack me with it while I was showering.  Holy cow!!  This stuff does wonders for your hair.  I don&#x27;t think my hair has ever been softer, smoother, or more healthy in it&#x27;s life.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Someone didn&#x27;t put the bottle together right so it leaked during shipping.  I love argon oil but not happy with the packaging and loss.</li>
    <li> I love that my Moroccan Argan Oil is multifunctional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my hair! I have thick, combination hair that is naturally wavy/curly. Sounds great, right? It is but since I have combination hair I have to be careful about the products that I use or my hair will look oil a few hours after washing it. In the same respect, if I don’t use product, my curls can frizz and make my hair look atrocious. I don’t use my Argan Oil on my hair daily; however, there are days that absolutely call for it. The past two days are great examples as it has been rainy which causes my hair to curl more and inevitably frizz more. On days like this or days when my hair is being unruly, I spritz some Argan Oil on and gently run my fingers through my hair. This adds a little extra bounce to my curl, keeps the frizz at bay, and leaves my hair feeling soft, and smelling great without unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my skin! This two involves the world combination. I definitely have combination skin and the funny part about that is different parts of my body have different types of skin. It is important to note that I also have extremely sensitive skin. The real “combination” part applies to my face. Depending on the day, hour, minute, I can have dry skin, oily skin, red skin … you name it and I have had it. Then, there are parts of my body that are dry. Argan Oil is used as an anti-aging product; however, it is so much more. I have been applying the Argan Oil to the dry zones of my body and have noticed that the area is starting to look and feel a bit more supple. Is this an overnight fix? No, nothing in life really is but the essential fatty acids within the oil work to repair and my hope is that is exactly what it will do. Until then, I will enjoy the feel of the oil on my skin, the feeling that is left behind as I feel softer and more feminine, and the pleasant scent is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat your hair and skin in the comfort of your home. Two big benefits in one little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate to facilitate this review. Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This oil is as described.  I actually like the fact that it is a lot thicker than some of the other oil I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out of my hair as fast as the other oils. It gives your hair a light sheen. I like the smell of it as well.  I was offered this product at a reduced price however,  this is a unbiased  review and it is solely based upon my usage of this Moroccan oil. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> A must have for humid areas!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the Moroccan Argan oil! Recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love the oil-makes my hair very soft and silky. One of the only oils, other than coconut that works so well.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing and my hair has NEVER looked better!! Great product!</li>
    <li> Love argon oil!  I have been using it in my hair for a while, and it is so silky.  I have had my hands in a lot of cleaning products lately, and I have been rubbing this on them at night.  It is making my hands silky smooth, and I am not suffering the damage from all the cleaning that I have been doing!</li>
    <li> Really like this.  I have been putting it on my hair during this dry season.  My hair is smooth and I have seen a noticeable decrease in the frizzy/fly-away hairs that I have!  So glad I got this.</li>
