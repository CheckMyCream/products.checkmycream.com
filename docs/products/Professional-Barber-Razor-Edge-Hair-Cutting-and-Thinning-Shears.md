    <li> Very nice scissors, exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
    <li> I bought this scissor two weeks ago,it looked very nice but might be a little tiny for some people. For me it&#x27;s just the right size and it looks sharp, well made. If later it didn&#x27;t work well I will add another comment.</li>
    <li> I use these for dog grooming. They work well for thinning. The finger holes are a little small for male fingers. Seem well made.</li>
    <li> Quality product. These don&#x27;t pull hairs but cut them.</li>
    <li> I used this for my Cavapoo puppy. Didn&#x27;t cut at all. I had to keep chopping at the same spot several times before it would get any off. At that rate, it would take me all night to cut. I found one that costs twice as much but works many times better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this for a dog.</li>
    <li> I bought these scissors because I want to be able to trim the ends of my hair with out having to go into a hair stylist. While I have never owned nor bought proper hair scissors before, these are perfect for me. I have medium-small hands and these are comfortable without the gel inserts. They are sharp, clean, well manufactured. The comb blades&#x27; tension can be adjusted with a little knob. 5/5, they do a great job and are what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> works pretty well so far, requires talent so learn how to use this before you just start chopping, i watched you tube videos.</li>
    <li> Use is while your hair is wet. extends the life of your haircut, especially if your hair gets too thick before to long</li>
    <li> Thanks! Fast shipping! Great quality!</li>
    <li> The Utopia scissors are grate very shary now pulling when cutting hair .I recommend them for any one feathering or thinning their hair  .Just a well made pair of scissors.Thanks</li>
    <li> These are nice!  They&#x27;re sharp and cut nicely.  I&#x27;m not a hairdresser but I sometimes cut my own hair and these scissors gave my hair a much better look. ~ But the case arrived with the zipper completely destroyed.  Why bother sending the case if I can&#x27;t even use it? ;)</li>
    <li> very good for the price. I think it will last several lifetimes for home use. a pro barber probably might think otherwise but it is very good for home use. I like the adjustable tension on the hinge/screw. seems that will keep it &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; over time</li>
    <li> Product received as described.  Speedy delivery and excellent packaging.  Bought for son and he likes this pair of thinning scissors better than the ones he&#x27;s been using.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. I love these scissors. The delivery was faster than espected and very well packed.</li>
    <li> Heavy well made and came packed in it&#x27;s own beatiful case.  It stays protected and sharp and could have been presented as a gift in it&#x27;s lovely case.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a very good thinning scissor.  Has very high quality construction and professional feel to it.  And the at the price it&#x27;s being sold; this makes it a five star.  We have an older scissor of this type that lasted oh 20+ years.  Since you can&#x27;t really hone and sharpen these scissors your only option is to buy a new one.  This Utopia Care scissor textured hair seamlessly.  The cut is razor sharp.  No binding, grabbing or pulling at my hair which I so much dread with my old scissor.  The pressure adjustment knob is an added bonus for those who wants to fine tune the feel of the cut.  Absolutely recommended!</li>
    <li> The scissors are of good quality and are a very reasonable price. I will be using them on my sons hair frequently.  They are also nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> As scissors they work great.  Construction-wise they could be better.  The ring finger stud easily unscrews; we found it better by completely removing it.  The rubber around the finger holes came off after about 3 seconds of use; again, we found the scissors were better without it.  All in all not bad; but certainly not great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this scissors, it&#x27;s light, and there&#x27;s a screw/knob to adjust preffered tightness. I like the idea that it can probably sharpened if needed. oh and I was surprised with the case it&#x27;s very useful to keep scissors safe and it&#x27;s cute too.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable...  Reviews requested before items received. These scissors are a joke, pure junk, total waste of money. Do not buy! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised but they are smaller than I expected for &amp;#34;Professional Barber&amp;#34; scissors. That said they have a nice feel (once I took the finger inserts out) and appear to be a good quality tool. They have already paid for themselves by expanding the time between professional haircuts.</li>
    <li> Left hand shears is not what I thought I was getting and it did not state that in the description. Tried using them with my left hand the don&#x27;t cut, their not sharp at all</li>
    <li> I bought these because I saw my hairdresser using this type of scissor to create choppy layers in my bangs.  I received these in a small zippered pouch and in very good condition.  I tried them on my dry hair first which didn&#x27;t work quite well, so I wet my bangs and tried using again with good results.  I am not a hair stylist, but I cut my families hair often.  These scissors are a time saver because I can now go longer between trims at the salon.  These are something I would recommend to people who want to experiment with their own hair or just have a quick trim between salon visits.</li>
    <li> Sharp and blends nicely as it says it does.  I chose this product over a comparable product that cost twice as much.  Glad I made this choice.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged in a storage case and very well made. As far as use, I found out that if you have thick hair you want thinning shears with only one edge with teeth. These have both edges with teeth which are supposed to be better with thin hair. That worked for me. But just in case you need to know!</li>
    <li> Nice thinning shears for the price.  They probably wouldn&#x27;t work professionally, but for the touch-up that I do, they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp scissors. Thins hair out just right.</li>
    <li> My wife says these work GREAT, as expected.  She spent many years as a licensed cosmetologist.</li>
    <li> Love these scissors.  They look beautiful, feel great in your hand and cut well.  They come in a small carrying box.</li>
    <li> I have only used the scissors once.  They seemed to work well, sharp, did the job, with a very nice case to boot!</li>
    <li> I ordered these scissors for my daughter-in-law so she could cut my grandson&#x27;s and my son&#x27;s hair.  She stated that, straight out of the box, she was able go give them excellent haircuts including thinning and a mohawk.  The scissors arrived sharp with large comfortable finger openings and a smooth operation.</li>
    <li> came shorter than i expected, but it looks neat</li>
    <li> These arrived at a pretty good time ..ive had things come alot faster but no complaints for arrival .. Although they seem dull but maybe I just need to get used to them ..they will be cutting fine and inspots not cut at all ..</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Cut nicely and the package came very quickly. Happy customer here</li>
    <li> These are not what I would call professional quality, but they are very nice and will be great for trimming my bangs and top of my hair between hair cuts. My hairdresser suggested that I get thinning scissors for the job.</li>
    <li> Solidly built, excellent quality, very nice carrying case; arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> It thins your hair and does the job perfectly without painful tugging. I would say it&#x27;s worth the purchase considering its reasonable pricing.</li>
    <li> It looks like a cheap product but it works great. 4 stars for the construction quality.</li>
    <li> They do the job but they don&#x27;t seem like they were sharpen or shaped  correctly because my hair catches in them more than they should.  Not quite the quality I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Excellent value, scissors work great.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> First, it&#x27;s NOT made in Japan. and poor quality, the cushion in between the rings loss, drop and I cannot find it in 10 sec..considering the price, can&#x27;t expect more...</li>
    <li> I got these for trimming my bangs so that they don&#x27;t have that straight edged ruler look. They work beautifully! Now I can trim my bangs myself and not have to go to the stylist and pay to have it done.</li>
    <li> Love the scissors! Great quality. Shipped quickly. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked great and came in a nice case to keep them from any damage.&lt;br /&gt;These were a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice pair of thinning shears!  I am using this for my dog and this is fabulous and very inexpensive.  This is the one to buy, at least for trimming up your dog&#x27;s ears and such.</li>
    <li> I got these for cutting my own hair. I didn&#x27;t NEED them but I like to have nice things. I noticed the barber always used these and I like the effect they give. I consider myself a perfectionist and I appreciate quality, these scissors definitely meet my expectations.. They are good and sharp too. I&#x27;m sure there are better ones (there always it) but those cost $$$. I can&#x27;t imagine how much better you can get anyway. I&#x27;m glad I found these because they are a good product for a good price!</li>
    <li> I was a little iffy when purchasing these because for starters the price was really cheap. When I received them I was a little disppapointed because they didn&#x27;t look sharp, it wasn&#x27;t until I actually started using them that I was blown away, they are extremely sharp, cut very well and can&#x27;t go wrong with a price this low</li>
    <li> Really good scissors!!! Really really good</li>
    <li> Nice pair of scissors; packaged well in zip case.  Not the best out there, but certainly great for the money.  Only used a couple times a month.</li>
    <li> They seem so cheap. Just the sound they make when they snip, sounds like such cheap metal. They work for now, but as soon as they get dull I have a feeling I will just have to toss them and buy a new pair. I will be looking elsewhere next time</li>
    <li> I got the 5.5&amp;#34; thinning scissors and they work great. I&#x27;ve had this for approximately 1 year and they work just like new. The 5.5&amp;#34; is the full length of the scissors not the length of the cutting parts. The 5.5&amp;#34; is a bit short for me but gets the job done.</li>
