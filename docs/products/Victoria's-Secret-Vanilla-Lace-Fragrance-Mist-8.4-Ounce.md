      <li>The mist is fine</li>
      <li>It does have very strong smell of rubbing alcohol when you first put it on, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s to amplify the upcoming scent.</li>
      <li>I received this order quickly and was excited to try because I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I spray it EVERYWHERE, lasts all day and has a light non offensive vanilla fragrance</li>
      <li>It works, smells fantastic and contains no deet so you can use it on the kids.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A good choice if you&#x27;re looking for a neutral scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as always . Quality and Security Service in the delivery</li>
    <li> This is has been one of my favorite scents for many years! Smells amazing and is purchasing it on here is definitely better than paying $14+ for it in the store!</li>
    <li> smells so yummy cant get enough!</li>
    <li> This fragance is alcohol!! -.-</li>
    <li> Very well, I will love its aroma is like a delicate perfume</li>
    <li> I received this order quickly and was excited to try because I love this fragrance.  The first time I sprayed it on it smelled heavenly.  I sprayed it again and there was no smell, only the smell of alcohol.  I opened the bottle and smelled and there is no fragrance, only the smell of alcohol.  Apparently the only perfume was in the pump straw when it arrived and now only smells like a bottle of rubbing alcohol.  I am very upset and will never purchase again.  I did not save my receipts because after spraying the first time I threw them away or I would return this item.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I ordered this, but once I got it, and put is on my wrist, it smelt AWFUL! I dare you look on the bottle, it says vanilla and musk. This is more musk than vanilla. I recommend not buying this perfume, it sucks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly shriveled up woman who was hit on by 20 year old kid while wearing this fragrance. I say it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> omg best perfume ever</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay around longer than a minute.</li>
    <li> For Me I love Vanilla.</li>
    <li> not strong enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you get Vanilla Lace perfume??</li>
    <li> The spray works great. I&#x27;m sure that it is very good for what it was made for. But I&#x27;m using it as a replacement for skin so soft while fishing. Very good for protecting you from the biting insects.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Lacking any smell. Won&#x27;t buy again. Waste!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Thank you. Fresh fragance. I love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2, When I spritzed both to see if it smelled like the ones from the store (Victoria Secret itself), they smelled more like rubbing alcohol than vanilla. I had to spray a lot just to get the scent of Vanilla to come out. Not ordering again online, just going to the store, then again I don&#x27;t know how old these bottles are?</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it so much that she took it from me and made it her own!</li>
    <li> Sweet scent! my hubby loves to smell my neck every time because of this! makes me feel sexy!</li>
    <li> A vanilla fan I am not, but this at least  smells the way it should.  There isn&#x27;t that disgusting, after scent that comes with some of others of it&#x27;s kind. I have not noticed the alcohol smell that was spoken of by another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a gift for my older daughter who does love the smell of vanilla. I believe she&#x27;ll enjoy it and even though I&#x27;m not a fan, it&#x27;s one I can tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: If you&#x27;re looking for something that will last long after you&#x27;ve sprayed it on, this will do it.  My daughter does only one tiny spritz and we can smell it for several hours.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of vanilla!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Received even before it was due.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the best Vanilla body spray out there. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen over the last decade but have been set on VS&#x27;s for about 8 years solid. The mist is fine so the bottle lasts a long time, too!</li>
    <li> My mom got this for me since I love the smell of vanilla and this smells absolutely wonderful! Kind of reminds me of dessert. The scent lasts for most of the day on me.</li>
    <li> Love it. Pleasant scent and not too strong. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Vanilla Lace.  I have a problem breathing perfumes with strong smells (I think it is the Alcohol in them) they give me head aches.  This perfume doesn&#x27;t effect me that way.  It also reminds me of all the things I love, (baking, chocolate chip cookies, etc) which makes me happy.  I have used this perfume for at least 20 years now, and don&#x27;t see myself changing.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  The real deal!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances! So classic&amp;timeless, absolutely perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this scent.  I get tired of buying scent from the stores that really doesn&#x27;t have any small.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! Plus its a great deal for the price. I actually bought this for someone else as a birthday present but now I have to buy one or two for myself as well! Great treat for yourself or makes a great present. Will be buying more! Highly reccomend if you love how vanilla smells!</li>
    <li> smells great!!! wife loved the Vanilla scent!</li>
    <li> Great scent. It smells just like the ones at Victoria Secrets. Ive shopped there for years and this has always been my favorite scent and im glad its on here cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love the scent...ordered twice already :)</li>
    <li> This helps repel mosquitoes!  And smells great. A trick I learned in Louisiana. .</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Repels gnats!  Really!  It works, smells fantastic and contains no deet so you can use it on the kids.  Thank you Victoris&#x27;s Secret!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent that last almost all day.</li>
    <li> wife really likes this, she will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Smells so amazing, victoria secret perfume can never go wrong. Good price and last quite a few months.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use all 3...the body wash, the body lotion and this spray every day.  I love vanilla and this seems to last and last.</li>
    <li> Wow,this stuff stunk...</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! The perfume smells sexy and a little bit floral. I personaly love vanilla, and this product is perfect!!! It isn&#x27;t overly strong, and lasts for hours!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> It smells so bad!!! I mean it. It is more like a mosquito repellent spray. I AM SO SORRY but I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law who was looking for this item in every Victoria Secret store, but couldn&#x27;t find it.  I finally found it on Amazon and got it for her.  She was very happy!</li>
    <li> very good seller, excellent product thanks.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice no problem with shipping</li>
    <li> just great long life too.i will buy more for sure awesome very real smell ..smell very rich i love it</li>
    <li> no comment! for my grand kid.</li>
    <li> was leaking through the packaging when it arrived, but i love the scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I love vanilla fragrances and this is a great one!  Also, it is not too heavy but the scent lasts for a long time.  Also, the price is excellent in comparison to what I would have paid at a Victoria&#x27;s Secret store</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Love this scent!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough but my hubby likes it so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> accordance with the purchase meets the expectations</li>
    <li> Yummy. Lots of vanilla scent. Sweet, but not overpoweringly so.</li>
    <li> I hate other vanilla perfume but this one is perfectly sweet and inviting. It has easily become my favorite scent. - It&#x27;s also cheaper to buy on amazon than in stores ($10 vs. $14)</li>
    <li> People asked me if I was wearing some vanilla cake perfume at work lol, definitely didn&#x27;t ask if I was wearing alcohol of some sort. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good fragrance</li>
    <li> I love how soft and subtle this scent is, but be very careful about how much you spritz on. If you put it on too heavily, you risk the chance of having that faint alcohol smell that can overpower softer smells. Over all it&#x27;s really sweet and DOES smell like vanilla, you just have to learn to spritz in moderation.</li>
    <li> This was wonderful, will be ordering some more by Christmas.  Please let me know if it goes on sale.  Thank You...KJ</li>
    <li> I order  it for my wife she really  enjoy  the smell .she told me this is now my favorite  hunny</li>
    <li> Love my Victoria Vanilla Spray!!</li>
    <li> My signature fragrance!!! So glad I was able to find it on Amazon because most of the Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores have discontinued it. It&#x27;s the only vanilla scent that I can actually stand. Some say it smells like chocolate, some say it smells like cookies, and some can&#x27;t quite put their finger on it, which is wonderful. I&#x27;m so disappointed the Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores have stopped selling it, but I&#x27;m glad that it is still available on Amazon. I purchased three bottles and will be back for more soon!</li>
    <li> Found out it could not be returned. and to be honest, it has hardly any smell to it.  Sprayed on a LOT and just barely could tell I had it on.  And, I do not like strong smelling perfunes or body sprays.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE, A GOOD PRODUCT...</li>
    <li> Excellent spray. Large oz size and not to expensive either. The smell is amazing, it honestly reminds me of a bakery. The one and only con is that it becomes super subtle after a few minutes, I wish it was longer lasting and had a stronger smell after the initial spray.</li>
    <li> It does have very strong smell of rubbing alcohol when you first put it on, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s to amplify the upcoming scent. After it&#x27;s on for a little while, you really smell the vanilla. But it&#x27;s more of a musky vanilla, I wouldn&#x27;t really describe it as a candy sweet vanilla. It&#x27;s very sexy though, not so much sweet and cute if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome. I get complimented on the scene often. The only problem is in spring and summer, the sweet smell sometimes attracts bees.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my boyfriend said he loved it.  I don&#x27;t like vanilla scent that well.  The price was very good for this item and it arrived in great condition in a very short time.  My rating was because I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent.  The seller did a great job!!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell.</li>
    <li> 1 of my favorites scents! thanks</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL. Vanilla is my fav</li>
    <li> Excellent , it&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
    <li> If you like or love Vanilla, this is worth your dollar!! At first it smelld like a vanilla cake...thats just yummy...bought this for a friends birthday which is today but we won&#x27;t see her till saturday...let me tell ya what, its hard to let this go, lol...so if shes not all about vanilla, she can give it back to me lol, cuz i would love to wear it daily!!</li>
    <li> This is the best vanilla purfume ever made. It smells like straight up pure vanilla and it lasts all day! It also has a tiny musky scent with it, not too noticable, but it gives it that perfect feminine smell. I will repurchase!</li>
    <li> the product arrive at excellents condicion</li>
    <li> If you like vanilla,this is the one.It smells like brownies. The price is great. My man loves it!! I love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any vanilla scents in a long time this fragrance is soft and sweet! Scent last all day and can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> I literally could drink this stuff. Buy it, buy it, buy it. Such a husky, warm vanilla. You will want to bathe in this stuff.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be fake. In ten minutes the fragance vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a user of Victoria Secret and I&#x27;ve never bought one as bad as this one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. Vanilla is one of my favorite scents and this one takes the cake because it is sweet but nor overpowering, and a good price.</li>
    <li> excellent, I highly recommend it. serious. excellent product</li>
    <li> Excellent. He loved my wife</li>
    <li> excelente producto 100% recomendado</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING. I get complimented all the time about it. Besides the product itself being perfect, the seller did great with shipping too. Arrived in 2 days, 6 days earlier than expected, in an undamaged box. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> Smells so so good,like vanilla extract so yummy love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, use it everyday.</li>
    <li> It smells good but kinda gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Delivery was swift. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I ADORE THIS SCENT and men(&amp; women) tell me I smell like cookies. Right out of the shower and after a towel off.... I spray it EVERYWHERE, lasts all day and has a light non offensive vanilla fragrance</li>
    <li> The scent fades to quickly. I put some on and when i got outside its like im not wearing any cologne, it does not have a lasting effect.</li>
