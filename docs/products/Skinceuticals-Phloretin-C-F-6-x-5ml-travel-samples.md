      <li>Skinceuticals Phloretin CF is a fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product that really brightens and smooths my skin.  </li>
      <li>though the smell is similar, the one I know is real is more oily.</li>
      <li>I tried the sample for $30 and not the full bottle for $100</li>
      <li>I felt a burning sensation and quickly washed it off</li>
      <li>It oxidizes quickly as with most high quality vitamin C serums.</li>
      <li>Product was promised to be fresh.  </li>
      <li>it has not aged very much and is still very fresh!</li>
      <li>Buying these smaller vials gave me a great price (since they are typically samples when individual) and they are great to travel with since you don&#x27;t want to bring a huge bottle of such a pricey product in your bag.</li>
      <li>This seller ships very fast</li>
      <li>I purchased these from the Texas Beauty Company and the smell and color is exactly as the sample I received from the aesthetician.</li>
      <li>but SO much cheaper!</li>
      <li>Phloretin C F is a dark orange color which means it is oxidized and therefore it is no longer effective</li>
      <li>I have read many articles where it has been rated high for helping with sun damage and it helps to prevent future sun damage.  </li>
      <li>also I did not notice any odor at all as was written in some reviews, and I am super sensitive to smells.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It really protect your skin.  </li>
      <li>I am not out too much money for them</li>
      <li>I have used this product before which I purchased from a certified Skinceuticals supplier and used for months without any problems and I give the real thing a 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I used it and didn&#x27;t really think anything about it</li>
      <li>Then after several more weeks I started noticing that old sun spots that I&#x27;ve had for years were fading away and eventually gone.  </li>
      <li>very gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am 56 years old and was first introduced to this stuff by my dermatologist because it is a vitamin C, antioxidant solution for your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a MUCH better deal to by it in the sample case here than to buy it in the larger bottle as it is the same amount of product</li>
      <li>I like the cute small bottles</li>
      <li>, it is clearly stated on the box that these are not-for-sale samples.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I am 56 years old.</li>
      <li>They said it was old.  </li>
      <li>Nice dropper, but they are small so be careful not to knock over on counter!</li>
      <li>It come in a little sample light blue box like the picture.  </li>
      <li>but the skin remained red and sensitive to touch.  </li>
      <li>A couple of days later,  inflamed cysts developed in the affected area, which I am still nursing.</li>
      <li>My skin is slightly oily and this makes my skin glow without the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look that I really don&#x27;t like.  </li>

    <li> Great product!  Great price compare to the regular 1oz. bottle.  Easy for traveling purposes.  It really protect your skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals Phloretin CF is a fabulous product.  it is really good for your skin and is very fast-acting.  See results in days not months!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff really makes skin look nice, again bottles were not sealed almost sent back.hope its okay. next time will buy at different store.</li>
    <li> I really like the small bottles.  The serum stays fresh and works beautifully.  My skin is slightly oily and this makes my skin glow without the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look that I really don&#x27;t like.  I will definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I am not sure  what they are doing as I cannot see results, but I do like the travel samples and I will see over time how they work. I am not out too much money for them so it is not an investment. If it turns out that there is actually skin improvement then I will reorder.</li>
    <li> very gentle on my sensitive skin.  also I did not notice any odor at all as was written in some reviews, and I am super sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that really brightens and smooths my skin.  It is the best antioxidant that is on the market and to get it for this price is amazing. This seller ships very fast and also the product came to me tinted very slightly yellow meaning it has not aged very much and is still very fresh! If you get this product dont forget to refridgerate your other vials so they dont go bad.</li>
    <li> Product was promised to be fresh.  When I opened the package, it was dark yellow, meaning it has oxidized.  It smelled like alcohol.  The shelf life of this product is very short.  Contacted the manufacturer and gave them the lot number on the box.  They said it was old.  Seller wanted it back to resell.  Warning...do not buy this product from them...it&#x27;s old, not fresh</li>
    <li> My friend swore by this product but it did not seem to help me... however, i have acne prone/sensitive skin. I wanted to restore skin tone due to blemishes from blackheads but had to find something else to take care of it...  Glad I tried the sample for $30 and not the full bottle for $100+...</li>
    <li> Buying these smaller vials gave me a great price (since they are typically samples when individual) and they are great to travel with since you don&#x27;t want to bring a huge bottle of such a pricey product in your bag.</li>
    <li> These tiny vials are perfect for travel.  Nice dropper, but they are small so be careful not to knock over on counter!</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old and was first introduced to this stuff by my dermatologist because it is a vitamin C, antioxidant solution for your face. I don&#x27;t ever wear anything on my face so my dermatologist asked to please just use this, if nothing else. I used it and didn&#x27;t really think anything about it and then one day I noticed that my face seemed to look brighter.  Very subtle change and I thought I was imagining it.  Then after several more weeks I started noticing that old sun spots that I&#x27;ve had for years were fading away and eventually gone.  Friends (who didn&#x27;t know I was on this stuff) started making comments out of the blue that I looked younger or joking about me not aging.  It&#x27;s not a radical change, very subtle but it definitely works. I told my daughters and my BFF about it and they started using it and getting the same results and comments from people. It&#x27;s definitely a MUCH better deal to by it in the sample case here than to buy it in the larger bottle as it is the same amount of product but SO much cheaper! Plus, you only use 2 drops of this stuff at a time so even the tiny bottles last a very long time. I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased these from the Texas Beauty Company and the smell and color is exactly as the sample I received from the aesthetician.</li>
    <li> I used it for 2 months, this is my second time, and I have noticed improvement in my skin. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I got this product from Minhtam Boutique through Amazon.  When I used it on the side of my face I felt a burning sensation and quickly washed it off but the skin remained red and sensitive to touch.  A couple of days later,  inflamed cysts developed in the affected area, which I am still nursing. I have used this product before which I purchased from a certified Skinceuticals supplier and used for months without any problems and I give the real thing a 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the smell is similar, the one I know is real is more oily. And -of course- did not damage my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued use immediately and wasted $60 dollars, and I am now very skeptical of buying cosmetics through the internet again.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is clearly stated on the box that these are not-for-sale samples.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how can Amazon not verify what is being sold through its website!</li>
    <li> This stuff is liquid gold for the face, the science and benefits of this is truly AMAZING!! Skinceuticals have once again out done themselves :-)</li>
    <li> I received this item within 4 days. The samples serum liquid was white. It come in a little sample light blue box like the picture.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Results within a month of daily use. It oxidizes quickly as with most high quality vitamin C serums. I keep it refrigerated.</li>
    <li> This is so good for your skin. If you can&#x27;t tolerate the 20% vit C, this one has only 10%.  I like the cute small bottles and it turns out that this package is a good deal for a skinceutical brand.</li>
    <li> Phloretin C F is a dark orange color which means it is oxidized and therefore it is no longer effective</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the Phloretin C F is a must!  Rosacea, years of sun and aging requires a lot of attention.  Travel size made more room for carry-ons.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It keeps your skin looking beautiful and bright.  I have read many articles where it has been rated high for helping with sun damage and it helps to prevent future sun damage.  I get a lot of compliments on my skin and I am 56 years old.</li>
