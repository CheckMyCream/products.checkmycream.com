<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a little on the small size, but very nice.</li>
    <li> Overall, I would say this is a sturdy, well constructed trimmer and perfect for travel.  I bought a second pair for my wife and she&#x27;s found it to be very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great cuticle / hangnail clipper. It comes in a small black carrying bag. Works effectively on cuticles or hangnails, has sharp cutting edges and is easy to store.</li>
    <li> Good Item but hard for old people to use.</li>
    <li> I like that these open far.  I have a thick nail.  They cut nicely and seem sharp. Very pleased with them.  I also like the carry bag that came with them, nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Not nearly enough leverage for thick nails.</li>
    <li> Hard to control when doing your own nails. Better on someone else.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Actually haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look and feel like they will do a good job</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper is great! Sharp, easy to use and the best buy for the price!</li>
    <li> It really sliced through my oh-so-sad thick toenails, far better than any other in the long trail of inferior clippers I have tried.  Tough to spend $20 for a pair but well worth it in terms of your well-being.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades, comes with a thick plastic blade protector, easy to handle. Good buy, good price. Arrived on time; great seller. I would recommend both the product and seller.</li>
    <li> It does the job and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
    <li> Work beautifully, cut clean and easy.  reasonable price</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. Cuts nails with little effort.</li>
    <li> good product good service fair price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with these clippers. I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much when I bought them - I got them discounted because the manufacturer was looking for people to try out the product. But they&#x27;re sharp, and can power through just about any nail with ease. They provide a firm clip for thinner nails as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product Awesome seller</li>
    <li> Rather cheaply made and smaller than I expected. Still not what I am looking for in a clipper. I guess the low price reflects what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These helped me a LOT over using a toenail clipper when dealing with my ingrown toenail issues. I just used it for the first time today and it went MUCH easier than how I normally did things. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Worth the money I spent and it&#x27;ll help for a long time, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad as he has really thick toenails and was experiencing difficulty cutting his toenails with regular clippers, even when trying to cut them immediately after bathing when the nails were softer. he was able to cut through all his nails with ease.</li>
    <li> Received what I expected.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks nice &amp; came in nice bag. If it doesn&#x27;t work well will let you know..</li>
    <li> This seller has a high class operation - The clippers ship in a classy pouch, are of sterling quality and arrive right on time. They are absolutely serious clippers. Sharp and clean looking and really do a class act on a tough job that unfortunately is necessary for some people. They made it easier and not so unpleasant. The description for their product is right on.</li>
    <li> These are really good for very thick toenails, if you suffer from such as I do.  The &#x27;cure&#x27; is to have them pulled.  I prefer this approach!</li>
    <li> excellent clippers , very easy to cut with</li>
    <li> I had thought these would be slightly bigger and was surprised to see they were the same size as previous clippers I had bought. The big difference was the quality! Very easy to use and they cut my &amp;#34;tough as nails&amp;#34; toenails without any problem. I was so happy I wanted to do a little dance. Definitely one of my better purchases.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and quality.  Works great on tough toe nails.  Hope to have for years.</li>
    <li> I bought clippers, tried them and returned them after few days.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are not sharp enough. You really need to exert force in order to cut  thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are not engraved so it slides out of your hand.</li>
    <li> This works great, much better than the one made by Body Toolz. Well worth it&#x27;s higher cost.</li>
    <li> Not sharp!  Try cutting thick toenails with dull blade!</li>
    <li> This toenail nipper works great! It cuts through very thick toenails quickly. Sometimes I fidget with how to hold it, though. I wonder if a shorter handle would be better for me.</li>
    <li> Very well made and study.</li>
    <li> Well made! I tried a couple of other clippers here on Amazon, with no luck the others would not cut through the nail with out extreme pressure or they would not cut at all....These clipper are the Best! I am an extremely picky buyer! I just wanted a quality clipper that did what is says it will do..... Look no further BUY THESE YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son and he loves them......</li>
    <li> Works great, got it on time, and do not see any problems in the future.</li>
    <li> nice nail clippers and have had two broken toes and thie nail came back very thick and this work great,</li>
    <li> Works like my Revlon clippers did years ago when they were new. Cuts right through with no jagged edges.</li>
    <li> Just the thing for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; folks!</li>
    <li> Great for the thick nail.  Open and close was a little though.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and clearly &amp;#34;made in China.&amp;#34; I feel like I paid for something super high quality, something made in Switzerland perhaps. But no, while these work only &amp;#34;OK,&amp;#34; the biggest issue is the cheap appearance and the high price.</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago so am still learning to use it. It will take some practice to make it work efficiently without cutting skin. Once the toe nails are cut correctly it should work fine.</li>
    <li> Small and hard to use.  Poor leverage for cutting toe nails..  Should be curved.</li>
    <li> Nice basic nippers/clippers for thick toenails...initially I didn&#x27;t think the item would be that great but it seems to get the job done on my one difficult-to-cut big toenail and that is what the item was purchased for.</li>
    <li> Used these one time...put them back in their black pouch.  I got them out today to use them and they are so rusted I cannot even open them.</li>
    <li> These clippers will cut nails that conventional &amp;#34;check out stand&amp;#34; clippers could never cut.  For thick nails, this type of clipper is a must.</li>
    <li> Curved so for large feet, thick toenails you cannot cut entire thick nail in one stroke with this clipper, and multiple clips are difficult due to the curved jaws. My straight edge clipper still works better as for the large toe nail it takes a few straight clips to trim from one side to the other.</li>
    <li> Great customer service and great product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the toe nail clippers.  They do the job I need and want.</li>
    <li> I  am NOT a vain person, and I&#x27;ve not been terribly concerned about my toenail fungus. But even I have had to admit that my toenails are ugly. Now that I have these clippers, they are still ugly, but they&#x27;re not so misshapen! That was because I was unable to trim my nails with normal clippers, because of the thickness of the hard fungus. No problem thanks to these clippers. The problem is much less obvious now that I can keep my nails nice and short. Big thanks to the podiatrist who told me to get a set of these!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s toenails are straight-up terrifying. These go through them like a hot knife through butter. The precision point allows you to get in and remove all the nail--no ingrowns! The blades also have a nice curve to them to help you slightly shape the nail. They also come with a hard plastic blade cover so you don&#x27;t inadvertently stab yourself, and a little flocked bag to hold them in. I&#x27;ve spend tons on toenail clippers to try and find the holy grail. These are it.</li>
    <li> These work great for cutting your toenails. They are sharp and precise. These toenail clippers make it easier for me to cut through thick toenails. They have a curve that makes it easier for me to get the correct angle to cut my toenails, with precision. They are really sharp so I would not keep these out in the open if you have children. This product was received for the purpose of inspection and testing. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> These Toenail clippers are great! They cut easily and cleanly. They&#x27;re also excellent for cuticle clippers. Bonus! They come in a carrying/storage pouch. The carbon steel feels like it would hold up for a long time, very sturdy. Overall, excellent clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received at a discount for review. All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product performs as expected.</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine any nail that these would not cut easily.  They will open as wide as you want them to.</li>
    <li> This nipper is beautifully made and comes in a very nice little cloth bag.  It worked well for me except on one especially thick toenail where, even with soaking in warm soapy water, just wouldn&#x27;t cut.  In fairness, my hands are arthritic and with the small size of the nippers, I just couldn&#x27;t exert enough force.</li>
    <li> Item arrived without the spring between the handles.</li>
    <li> Was told it would cut thick nails. NO SUCH LUCK</li>
    <li> Works as it should ....</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and sharp.  I wanted a spare to have in my doctor&#x27;s bag and these will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Perfect toe nail cutters. Super sharp. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> My experience with Renew Essentials has been excellent. When I had questions, Michael, was very attentive to my concerns and took care of me in an expedient and very friendly manner. And, my toe nail clippers are excellent. Very nice experience.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I chose to order these clippers.  I hadn&#x27;t realize just how dull my old clippers had become until I tried these.  All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;  What a wonderful difference on my thick toenails.  I only wish I had ordered them sooner.  They arrived on time and nicely packaged in a felt pouch.  One of the reviewers said theirs got rusty.  I figured, &#x27;a word to the wise&#x27;, so I&#x27;m not storing them in a steamy bathroom which should take care of potential rusting.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> The clippers are very sharp, and seem to be well crafted.  They easily cut through my very thick regrown nail from a big toe that had lost a nail a couple of years ago.</li>
    <li> Works great on thick toenails. regular clippers do not get the sides of the toe nail. these have prevented ingrown toenails for happening!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I have fungus toe nails these clippers work great</li>
    <li> Strong and does clip thick toenails.  Wish the handles had a bit of grip surface and a bit less smoothness.  Otherwise, great.</li>
    <li> Works great on tough, thick toenails.</li>
    <li> Was delivered without spring arm, very banged up, but still had sharp casting flash. Appears to be used, there is some kind of not-production-lubricant schmutz all over the tips. Gross and defective. Sent back for refund.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something different.</li>
    <li> Nice quality nail clippers. Easy to grip. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers will facilitate clipping thick toenails except that they really could be sharper.</li>
    <li> Definitely supplements large toenail clippers - the two tools work great together.</li>
    <li> I have some ratchet looking toenails and they are thick as hell but this toenail clipper works like a charm but be careful it is extremely sharp</li>
    <li> Bought these to use on my 88 year old dad&#x27;s thick toe nails.  I was using kitchen shears because regular nail clippers did not work.  These are amazing!</li>
    <li> These are the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them on my 86 year old mother&#x27;s VERY thick toenails.  She&#x27;s very sensitive to everything, so I was a little worried.  Not once when I was cutting her very long toenails, did she complain that it hurt.  These clippers are very sharp and easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has a loved one whose toenails have gotten out of control.  It&#x27;s a labor of love made easier with the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li> not as good as its says</li>
    <li> Does the job. Sturdy. Can&#x27;t find them anywhere else and the only thing that will tackle my wife&#x27;s toenails.</li>
    <li> I actually thought they would be easier to use!</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought these years ago.  They work so much better than regular toe nail clippers.</li>
    <li> High quality clippers for thick nails - and I have thick nails.  I thought most of the reviews were fairly accurate.  They did cut through some of my most problematic nails but I think they could have been better.  I don&#x27;t see them cutting through some of the extreme types of nails that people were describing.  I don&#x27;t know how durable they are as I&#x27;ve only had the for about 6 weeks.  I may try another highly top-rated one next time but for now I&#x27;m happy with these.</li>
    <li> they seem to be working just fine</li>
    <li> Boy these clippers are really the cats meow!. They work flawlessly on thick nails. The only problem is you have to watch it because you can cut down too deep if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Clippers worked excellent on hand and toe nails. Product was easy to use and felt safe.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have bought numerous clippers to try to get the best and easiest to work with. I am diabetic, and do my own foot care. These are by far the best and sharpest I have found at any price.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought the next size larger. These aren&#x27;t any better than regular toenail clippers, as far as I can tell. I disagree with the lady who &amp;#34;commented&amp;#34; that these were sharp enough to use with her arthritis. I have mild arthritis and these were not doing the job.</li>
    <li> Works good but a little long for me.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my toenails have gotten thick and my arthritis in my hands makes it very hard to keep them cut correctly.  These clippers were wonderful and snipped off the excess nail with no effort on my part at all.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Clipper blades did not remain sharp for more than 2 to 3 cuttings.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and very good - best I have ever owned</li>
    <li> Once again,  I am very impressed with the quality, sharpness and price of these clippers. Having purchased the cuticle clippers, I wanted to see if these were just as good, and Yes! They are! They are wonderful! Very sharp, durable and easy to store/carry.</li>
    <li> This works fabulously and is made of solidly.  Very, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are sharp, super sturdy and can clip through even thick toenails. I found them easier to use than traditional nail clippers because I could get a better angle and didn’t have to use much finger strength which I now lack due to arthritis.</li>
    <li> Great set of heavy duty clippers</li>
    <li> Works on old thick toenails.  What more can I say?  They come in a nice fabric pouch which makes them a little harder to misplace.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I purchased this because I was tired of using traditional toenail clippers which for me as a lefty always give me trouble. The long handles making clipping my toenails a wonderful experience. I’ve tried similar products in the past, but I found this one to be better than those because it&#x27;s the perfect size for my medium size hands and fits perfectly in my travel case. I definitely recommend this product. I’ll also be purchasing another really soon because my spouse keeps borrowing mine … and it never makes its way back :)</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers work well enough. They&#x27;re a little small for a secure grip and I have medium size hands. Doesn&#x27;t strike me that the best materials were used to make this item  very lightweight.</li>
    <li> I go with the reviews which like these clippers. They are sharp and cut the nail as they should.</li>
    <li> I have very thick toenails which normally take quite some time to cut.  I have been through many toenail clippers without much luck.  However, these worked perfectly.  I was able to quickly cut my nails with one quick snap.  The blade opens much wider than you would ever need and you can adjust it to the correct size.  It&#x27;s very sharp so will easily cut any nail, regardless of the thickness or length.  These are now one of my essential beauty items!</li>
    <li> sharp and you can tell that this product is made of great steel.  I believe that these will stay sharp for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;They can also be sharpened easily.</li>
    <li> Great Deal!  Hard toenails are so awful to deal with but these definitely make it easier!!</li>
    <li> Great nail cutting supplement, sharp and well made.....throw away cheap store bought nippers.</li>
    <li> This little tool is mighty and well worth every penny.  It is easy to use and sturdy for those annoying ingrown nails.  I would definitely recommend this Toenail Nippers to anyone in the market.  Rest assured that this companies customer service is outstanding and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, but the handles are slippery. Some grippy design for them would make them a better tool.</li>
    <li> Bought to cut toenails getting too thick for regular clippers.  All these do are mangle and bend the nail.  Even on more regular nails they cut poorly.  Definitely try a different one ... I&#x27;m on to try another.</li>
    <li> These nippers work. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Cute and easy to useThis little tool is mighty and well worth every penny.  It is easy to use and sturdy for those annoying ingrown nails.  I would definitely recommend this Toenail Nippers to anyone in the market.  Rest assured that this companies customer service is outstanding and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, bu5 pretty good</li>
    <li> Sturdy, sharp and curved just right for those tight areas.</li>
    <li> These are just about the sturdiest things I&#x27;ve found yet for cutting those tough toe nails. I love them, not to mention the cute little bag they come in.</li>
    <li> very good nipper,does a good job</li>
    <li> Easy to use.Real sharp,</li>
    <li> this is sturdy and takes some getting use to, but worth the time.  It is just different from regular clippers.  It is the user not the product.  Does a very good job</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers work well. They trim toenails cleanly and quickly.  They even come with a little black drawstring bag so it&#x27;s easy to store them.</li>
    <li> THEY WORK VERY WELL ON MY THICKER THEN NOMAL TOE NAILS..... THEY SHIPPED FAST TO</li>
    <li> Great Nail Nippers!  They&#x27;re the best that we&#x27;ve tried so far!&lt;br /&gt;All positive recommendations are right!</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have ever owned!  You can feel the quality of the material used in its manufacture, and so very sharp.  Thanks.......R.D.</li>
    <li> I love these nippers! They make the unpleasant task of trimming thick nails easy. When I had occasion to contact the seller I received excellent customer service, a real treat these days. I can recommend these nippers from this seller without reservation.</li>
    <li> High quality, durable.</li>
    <li> Most people cannot understand why I was so thrilled when these nippers were delivered.  For them it&#x27;s about as exciting as receiving a new phone book.  I lost my other nippers, but I was sure I would find them.  My big toes have thick and ugly toe nails.  While I was waiting to find my nippers, my toe nails grew to the point my shoes did not fit.  It was painful  That&#x27;s when I ordered these with next day delivery.  I thought I was buying the same nippers that I had been using for several years.  When first held these nippers I was disappointed,  These were much lighter than my old pair and I  didn&#x27;t believe they had the torque (power) to cut through my nails.  WRONG,  These nippers cut through my nails with little effort and shaped my nails which is something my heavier nips could not do.  These are exceptional nippers for the price,</li>
    <li> Just like my podiatrist uses.</li>
    <li> When I first saw it I thought it was cheap looking. However once I tried it I could see that it&#x27;s a good instrument. Sharp, precise, and strong enough to cut through thick toenails.  Easy to grasp. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for a tough job.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not perform as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Good clippers for toe nails</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m doing my toenails myself with these little gems.  Beats a pedicure by a mile</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who has problems with ingrown toenails.  I chose them due to the other reviews that I read before purchasing them.  We received them and he used them the next day.  He positively loved them.  He said they were so much better than the regular nail clippers he always tried to use.  Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Would not cut through thick toenails</li>
    <li> Very pleased.!!!!!  Exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Somewhat small for the task</li>
    <li> While they indicated these were new, they didn&#x27;t appear to be.  They were dirty and sticky. First thing I did was put them in disinfectant and clean them.</li>
    <li> These are for my mom who has really thick nails and she said it cuts right through. My mom is in her 70&#x27;s and she was able to get a good grip on the clippers.</li>
    <li> First pedicure/manicure tool I&#x27;ve bought in the past decade that ACTUALLY WORKS without having to mash down on the handles.  They&#x27;re sharp, they come in a neat little fabric storage bag, and they cut even thick toenails without having to squeeze with both hands.  Just goes to prove that paying a little bit more (well, 3x the others&#x27; prices, but still...only 20 bucks!) yields better products.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for thick nails</li>
    <li> These have been the only clippers that cut my thick nails. Very Happy and my nails are Happy :)</li>
    <li> I purchased these nippers so that I could help my hubby with his ingrown toenails.  Wow do they work!!  They are relatively small so they can get in there to appropriately trim the nail.  They are super sharp and cut very thick nails easily.  They also come in a nice bag with a heavy plastic blade protector.  For the first time in a very long time and after buying several clippers that didn&#x27;t work worth a darn, THESE ARE GREAT!!  :}</li>
    <li> Really works great.  Professional quality!!</li>
    <li> for the super tough nail these cut through them like a hot knife through butter</li>
    <li> Superior to all others!</li>
    <li> I was able to cut my husband&#x27;s very thick toe nails. This has been quite a chore but these worked well.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I had a couple of really hard fungus infected toes so I purchased these with the hopes of cutting out the fungus. I had the help of aloe toenail softener and oregano oil to soften my nails so I don&#x27;t know how these would work without that, but in any case, I was able to cut my big hard toe nails so these are a win for me.</li>
    <li> Very good quality excellent people to deal with</li>
    <li> These clippers look straight, but there is a strong curve toward the tip, making them useless for most jobs.  Seller should identify them as such.  They do seem to be made well.</li>
    <li> cuts my thick nails with ease</li>
    <li> I am using for a toenail clinic I do for charity- works really well.</li>
    <li> These work great on my funky toe nails,would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are the good, strong, sharp toenail nippers that will cut the thickest, oldest nails without splintering. They come with a guard so they don&#x27;t do (or get) any damage in a bag or drawer, plus a drawstring bag.</li>
    <li> Great big toe toe nail clippers, much better than comparable products available at drugstores.  Even better, they come in a chic little bag.  Not sure if you&#x27;d consider giving toe nail clippers as a gift, but if you would, these are perfect!</li>
    <li> In addition to having thicker nails, I cannot put my left leg over the right one due to hip replacement surgery.  Toe nail cutting was a problem before, but not anymore.  I can simply bend over and clip, and this does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the answer to my prayers!  Just be careful you don&#x27;t get too close to the skin, it is indeed very sharp!</li>
    <li> only clippers strong enough to do the job.... clip very tough &amp; thick nails</li>
    <li> Very good.Did the job well</li>
