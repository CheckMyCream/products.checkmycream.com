      <li>Packaged nicely.  </li>
      <li>Was a nice gift.  </li>
      <li>Nice quality tools and case.  </li>
      <li>Looks great, the case is beautiful and only time will tell how well it will hold up</li>
      <li>The tools are not the best quality and the cuticle clippers will barely clip anything.  </li>
      <li>This product It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty but very cheap quality.</li>

      <li>I like the case but the tools are cheap</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, well packed.</li>

      <li>as this &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; is hardly worth the purchase price.  </li>
      <li>I love that there are little smiley faces on most of the tools, but they were not up to par for me.</li>
      <li>It is not the case I ordered and all of the instruments are very cheap looking and  not the same condition as one you can buy in the store.</li>
      <li>I had adjusted my expectations and was okay getting so-so tools because I knew I&#x27;d only use it as a touch-up travel kit.</li>
      <li>and I think I could have gotten better quality at the local Dollar Store.</li>
      <li>The toe nail clipper broke the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>The add said it was stainless steel</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy impressed with this set.</li>
      <li>Fast turn around.  </li>

      <li>stff from being brand new.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recommend it and it supplier, very professional</li>
      <li>However the case which is nice leather was very hard to open at first but</li>
      <li>The tools in the image look quite nice but the actual tools I got were poorly made.</li>

<li> the tools that should be sharp aren&#x27;t sharp at all and the tools that shouldn&#x27;t be sharp are dangerously sharp.</li>
<li> I have had smaller manicure sets in the past.</li>
<li> I read the other reviews and still bought it.</li>
<li> One piece missing When i received order!</li>
<li> The nail file is so thin it bends whenever I try to use it.</li>
<li> but the broken part looks like its a casting of powdered metal.</li>
<li> However, this was worse than expected and I have a nasty cut to prove</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> I do not recommend the product unless you don&#x27;t mind spending all that money on just a case:(</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Not impressed. It is not the case I ordered and all of the instruments are very cheap looking and  not the same condition as one you can buy in the store. For this price it should be better quality and the case should be the one chosen.</li>
    <li> Ok could have been more sturdy loops to hold the utensils but ok for the price.</li>
    <li> This product It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty but very cheap quality.</li>
    <li> I have had smaller manicure sets in the past. This one has every tool imaginable for every job.  Love it.  Nice quality tools and case.  Winner!!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and still bought it. I had adjusted my expectations and was okay getting so-so tools because I knew I&#x27;d only use it as a touch-up travel kit. However, this was worse than expected and I have a nasty cut to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, the tools that should be sharp aren&#x27;t sharp at all and the tools that shouldn&#x27;t be sharp are dangerously sharp. If you&#x27;re like me and have short nails, DO NOT USE THE NAIL FILE or you will get cut. The edge of the file (again, because my nails are short and the edge of the nail doesn&#x27;t go beyond my finger tip) sliced through my finger with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> Was a nice gift.  Worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> The toe nail clipper broke the first time I used it.  The add said it was stainless steel but the broken part looks like its a casting of powdered metal.</li>
    <li> The tools in the image look quite nice but the actual tools I got were poorly made. The nail file is so thin it bends whenever I try to use it. The nail trimmers look as if they came out of a warped mold. If you are looking for a good nail set, get the one from Sephora.</li>
    <li> Just too good for the value, really good product with a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Just too good for the value, really good product with a great price.</li>
    <li> just what was advertised, will purchase again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it and it supplier, very professional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the purchase .</li>
    <li> Everything you could expect for the price.</li>
    <li> All you need in one place</li>
    <li> This is a very nice manicure set for the price. I really love the case!</li>
    <li> Looks great, the case is beautiful and only time will tell how well it will hold up</li>
    <li> Great product, they loved it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself as my other manicure set had seen better days. Arrived quickly, well packed. However the case which is nice leather was very hard to open at first but stff from being brand new. Works beautifully now and the tools are sharp and very well made.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets to compare them. Both were excellent quality.  I donated this set to the Visiting Nurses of Iowa City to use when they made home visits and they were glad to accept the donation.</li>
    <li> I like the case but the tools are cheap and I think I could have gotten better quality at the local Dollar Store. I do not recommend the product unless you don&#x27;t mind spending all that money on just a case:(</li>
    <li> Fast turn around.  Part was as advertised.</li>
    <li> One piece missing When i received order!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy impressed with this set. It is in no way a BAD mani set, it just isn&#x27;t amazing. I love that there are little smiley faces on most of the tools, but they were not up to par for me. One of the skinny tools kept falling out of the holder (I eventually lost the tool).</li>
    <li> I like the Manicure Set it is great for my nails and I have all the tools that I need.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  giving as Christmas gift.  Packaged nicely.  Arrived on time.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d look for another supplier (Sephora?) as this &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; is hardly worth the purchase price.  The tools are not the best quality and the cuticle clippers will barely clip anything.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This manicure pedicure set is wonderful.  The tools are very sturdy and not cheap at all.</li>
