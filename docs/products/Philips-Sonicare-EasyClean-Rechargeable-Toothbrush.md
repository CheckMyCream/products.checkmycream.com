      <li>wow these are great.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Nice, simple design, good ergonomics (not too big), great setting with the 4 30-second iterations alerting you to change the set of teeth you&#x27;re brushing.  </li>

      <li>It works the best and is the quietest; hold charge a long time, too, and the bristles last longer than most.</li>
      <li>It really cleans my teeth and gums, there has been a truly better feeling after use.  </li>
      <li>I have loved the previous model and now hope to have many years of clean teeth with this one as well.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush allows you to ramp up gently to full power if you are not used to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I have always loved sonicare toothbrushes and feel this model is far superior to the other.</li>
      <li>This is a tremendous value.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly through Prime program.</li>
      <li>Love this new version of Sonicare.</li>
      <li>These are a nice step up from the former bulkier ni-cd battery Sonicare version.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the old models.</li>
      <li>I was about to pay full price at my local department store, but glad I held off.  </li>
      <li>I recently upgraded to these and love them.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>When I first started using the brush, it made my nose itch something fierce...</li>
      <li>The smaller handle is nice, and the toothbrush attachment is much easier than the older screw on types.  </li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t tell you how surprised and pleased, along with my son, the overall improvement that has been made since I purchased my first model.  </li>
      <li>The whole Sonicare brush falls over at the slightest movement.</li>
      <li>It holds a charge very well.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a significant difference only after the the first couple of uses, and I&#x27;m looking forward to my next cleaning to see how much of a difference these toothbrushes have really made.</li>
      <li>I am purchasing this brush to replace an older Sonicare brush.</li>
      <li>So if you have been using the older designed Sonicare I would encourage you to upgrade to one of these newer models.  </li>
      <li>recommend these brushes highly.</li>

      <li>My first try at a sonic brush, takes a little getting used to but worth the practice.</li>
      <li>Had an old Sonicare that was always getting gunked up.  </li>
      <li>have sensitive gums and have not had any issues with any pain from these tooth brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent value and love how clean my teeth feel.  The toothbrush allows you to ramp up gently to full power if you are not used to an electric toothbrush.  After a few weeks of use, gums already feel healthier and less sensitive.</li>
    <li> I am purchasing this brush to replace an older Sonicare brush. The only thing I did not like about the older brush was the cleaning issues that have been rectified in this brush. When I first started using the brush, it made my nose itch something fierce... But after a few uses, my nose acclimated and that issue went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these brushes highly. It is tempting to use it like a regular toothbrush, moving it up and down and such, but don&#x27;t. Follow the directions, hold it lightly on the tooth and gum and move it very slowly. It was hard for me (especially in the morning.. I am not a morning person) to not just &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; as usual with the Sonicare, but once I got in the habit of the slow, light touch, my teeth and gums we amazingly clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> We have had different ele toothbrushes but this one is the best. Our teeth are cleaner</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Love these toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> Charge it, turn it on, brush each quadrant for 30 seconds, and that&#x27;s it.  The package comes with some nice accessories.</li>
    <li> These tooth brushes are always good.  I&#x27;m on my third one in twenty years...  These seem to scrub a little softer than the older ones, but still get the job done.  The smaller handle is nice, and the toothbrush attachment is much easier than the older screw on types.  My battery goes 3-4 weeks between charges.  Good product.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are some of the best.  I have used other mechanical ones and these actually use a different technique for cleaning your teeth.  The vibration can be felt, getting in between your teeth.  The 2 for $100 sale that Amazon was a pretty good deal along with the Sonicare name.  I was turned onto these brushes by a friend who is also a dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> Had an old Sonicare that was always getting gunked up.  In fact, I had bought the old style Sonicare toothbrushes for the entire family but it was too disgusting to keep them clean as they collected water within the handle that turned moldy - eek.  This EasyClean toothbrush is sleeker and doesn&#x27;t have the crevices to collect water.  It is clean and healthier for everyone.  Love the travel cases, too - very handy.</li>
    <li> Always loved my Sonicare.  This is a tremendous value.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend these. This is a great buy, do not let it pass you up. I have been using Philips Sonicare products for years and have never had a problem. I recently upgraded to these and love them. The batteries last a long time and you should never have to worry about them running out, especially if you keep them docked on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive gums and have not had any issues with any pain from these tooth brushes. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> Great price on a great product!  And I didn&#x27;t even have to go to Walmart!  What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Have always like sonicare toothbrushes. This is probably the third set that I have owned in my lifetime. Good buy</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and exceeded my expectations. It was very simple to use. Just click the green button to turn it on and that&#x27;s it. None of the unnecessary bells and whistles. Very nice and easy to use. Also, the travel case is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> Granddaughters loved them and they are now brushing more, and that was the idea, and it worked.  Everyone should have these brushes.</li>
    <li> These are a nice step up from the former bulkier ni-cd battery Sonicare version.  Slimmer handle and less areas where water and paste can accumulate.  We also like the smaller carry case since we like to take them with us when traveling.</li>
    <li> Philips makes the best &#x27;power&#x27; toothbrush by far.  It works the best and is the quietest; hold charge a long time, too, and the bristles last longer than most.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Easy to use.  Works great.  Easy to clean.  Great price.  Even comes with a nice travel container.</li>
    <li> The brush works ok but what is with the rechargeable base being so small. It will not support the Sonicare Brush system. The whole Sonicare brush falls over at the slightest movement. You have to make sure it is supported in some way. I have this plastic container that I had screwed to the wall making it a place for it so it won&#x27;t fall over. The picture makes it look like it sits up so nicely. You have to wonder who sat around and created this without thinking that the base will not support the entire brush system. I don&#x27;t know why people haven&#x27;t mentioned this. This is very annoying to have to create something to support it. It should not have been designed that way.</li>
    <li> Much better than the old models. Seems to have more power, is slimmer, charges faster and for longer and the changing of heads is a snap. My wife and I share a handle and switch brush heads.</li>
    <li> Ever since my 1st electric toothbrush, I never want to go back anymore. This is a great buy; however, I cannot find a replacement head that will ship to the Philippines. So I hope Philips can help me acquire a dozen replacement heads please. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. The head is a bit small and takes getting used to but my teeth feel squeaky clean all day!</li>
    <li> Great product that my wife and I love</li>
    <li> I used it everyday,it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Well its been a few years since i had a new electric tooth brush. wow these are great. I kept one ad gave the other as a birthday gift.  My teeth are whiter and gums have really been happy too Love it  Its the sonic vibrations that make all the difference</li>
    <li> Bought Feb 2014 and lasted until July 2015.  They just stop working.</li>
    <li> Excellent, love the timer, sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase sooner!</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes! Although the initial investment may seem expensive, the investment in our teeth will be enough of a payback. Only after using these for a week we can already feel the benefit!</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with not feeling like my teeth were getting clean a friend recommended this and my teeth feel so much cleaner!!!! I love the 2 pack deal and the carring case that comes with it.</li>
    <li> These are just wonderful.  That is the basic review.  I have had Sonicare before they were sold to Philips and was surely a little concern when Philips purchased them.  But Phillips has truly improved the overall design.  This is my third upgrade and this is surely the very best so far.  I just can&#x27;t tell you how surprised and pleased, along with my son, the overall improvement that has been made since I purchased my first model.  These don&#x27;t have that rattle around in my mouth like the two others.  They also solve the problem with the interface between the toothbrush head and the actual device.  The older designed would capture fluid from your mouth and it would build up around and inside the brush.  It was really awful looking stuff and a little difficult to clean.  The way the head and brush interface with this design that just ain&#x27;t going to happen.  This brush is also very small and very light compared to my last two devices.  It really cleans my teeth and gums, there has been a truly better feeling after use.  So if you have been using the older designed Sonicare I would encourage you to upgrade to one of these newer models.  Since I needed two, this purchase made sense.</li>
    <li> This is replacing a Sonicare I&#x27;ve had for a while that only hold a charge of about 36 house.  I have loved the previous model and now hope to have many years of clean teeth with this one as well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrushes.  Nice, simple design, good ergonomics (not too big), great setting with the 4 30-second iterations alerting you to change the set of teeth you&#x27;re brushing.  It holds a charge very well.  Simply a pleasure to use, with everything you need, and no extra setting to confuse or complicate things.</li>
    <li> I love these!!!  Had the original one 20+ years ago and didn&#x27;t remember how great it was.  These are slimmer and lighter.  Also appreciate the 30 second timer for equal brushing time for each quadrant of your mouth.  Have only had it for 5 or 6 days so can&#x27;t speak to the length of charge, but there was a difference in the whiteness of my teeth within 2 days!  Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Compact and the charge lasts at least a week.  The 2 pack is a great deal!  One for home and office.</li>
    <li> Love this new version of Sonicare. The handle is sleeker and easier to hold than my old E model and the brush head is slightly smaller, too. As always, the benefits are clear - gentle on my gums yet efficient at cleaning. I also like that it alerts you by quadrant as you brush. Every 30 seconds it alerts you to brush a different area rather than just the final 2 minute shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bundle we bought is perfect for my husband and me. We each now have our own brush and carrying case so if we are travelling alone we can take our Sonicare brush with us.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Has the 2 minute timer to keep the kids brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and granddaughter.  Both of them report feeling that their teeth are cleaner.  My 10 year old granddaughter is more into taking care of her teeth, partially because the timer is an excellent way for her to know when she is done. As well, the brushes have been holding a charge for 2 to 3 weeks each time, so far.  My daughter is so pleased with this product that she plans to buy these brushes for her husband and me when our birthdays come up.</li>
    <li> Really do a great job cleaning my teeth. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Awesome clean feel.</li>
    <li> I have always loved sonicare toothbrushes and feel this model is far superior to the other. It is also more hygienic because there is no place for water to seep in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to catch these on sale as a Gold Box item, and I finally have.  I was about to pay full price at my local department store, but glad I held off.  These toothbrushes are amazing!!!  I noticed a significant difference only after the the first couple of uses, and I&#x27;m looking forward to my next cleaning to see how much of a difference these toothbrushes have really made.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Arrived quickly through Prime program. Well packaged. I take off the brush every Sunday to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; it, but have never found anything to clean. I don&#x27;t know what others are doing to get the grunge they report, but I have not experienced any problems.</li>
    <li> great purchase.  Love that there are two of them with cases.  Teeth feel great.  Can&#x27;t wait to go to the dentist next time and find out the difference Sonicare makes.  It has a two-minute timer which is really nice.  Makes sure you have plenty of time to get all of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> My first try at a sonic brush, takes a little getting used to but worth the practice. My teeth feel cleaner after using. Battery lasts insane amount of time between charges. I use it 2x a day and charge it once every 3rd week. Highly recommend.</li>
