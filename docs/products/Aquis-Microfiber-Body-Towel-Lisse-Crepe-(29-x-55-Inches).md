      <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied with the absorbency</li>
      <li>After using the Aquis hair towel for many years I decided to try the body towel.  </li>
      <li>I have had one of these towels for MANY years - 10-15</li>
      <li>I understand why many people like Aquis microfiber towels.  </li>
      <li>so they&#x27;re not the most decorative looking</li>
      <li>This is body size, and to my surprise, the surface feels better so that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;snag\\&quot; your skin as you rub it.</li>
      <li>sure saves on laundry anyway.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: if you care about absorbency more than looks these are the towels for you.</li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>This towel will leave your body and hair fuzz-free, AND for those of you ladies with frizz-prone hair, it is WAY better than a cotton towel.</li>
      <li>It seems many stores no longer carry them.  </li>
      <li>For some reason the darker colors cost more.</li>
      <li>So glad I tried them.</li>
      <li>So glad I have it.</li>
      <li>Very nice microfiber and is very absorbent.</li>
      <li>I purchased two because my 21 yr old grandson loved mine too!</li>
      <li>It dries the body, and itself very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Easy to pack,</li>
      <li>This towel absorbs water off my body very quickly and thoroughly...</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t make drying off easy...</li>
      <li>The towel dries very quick and throughly.  </li>
      <li>Just got back from a backpacking trip through europe and this towel was great.</li>
      <li>I have one for my hair, so I wanted to try a larger one for the body, and it works great.</li>
      <li>Love these towels because they are so incredibly absorbant and take up very little space in your luggage or gym bag.  </li>
      <li>Pretty color, soft and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Washes up great, dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and they are great to wrap my long hair up after washing that too...</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>Very light weight and dries pretty quick.</li>
      <li>It will be great to take to my 3 day event and it&#x27;s PINK.</li>
      <li>I have one for my hair and am delighted to have the larger body towel.</li>
      <li>so much so that I&#x27;ve ordered more.</li>
      <li>Products arrived quickly and undamaged.  </li>
      <li>Quick drying towels.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>Back for more!</li>
      <li>These towels are well worth the money, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
      <li>the  pink is perfect, the crepe is delicious to the touch and capaciously absorbent, the little aquis label is subtle, even distinguished, in a modernist sort of way.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the material or the size, but nonetheless, it still works great.</li>
      <li>It is soft and dries you off very quickly.  </li>
      <li>and she likes hers very much also.  </li>
      <li>All you need to do is put it on your skin and it will absorb every last drop, none of that dampy feeling you get with most towels.</li>
      <li>I shall be buying more of various styles and colors.</li>
      <li>It was easy to wash, dried quickly and light to carry.  </li>
      <li>I love the texture, slight stretch and that it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Just as it advertised, it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love this towel to put my shampooed hair up before I dry it.</li>
      <li>The towel is fine, it doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as a regular towel</li>
      <li>My hair dries so much faster after having been wrapped up in this.</li>
      <li>Before getting one of these I bought a Turkish towel which was quite absorbent and very plush and snuggly.</li>
      <li>Fabulous towels for drying your hair in the smaller size.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight and just as absorbant as is advertised.  </li>
      <li>It is also very absorbant.</li>
      <li>These really seem to be quality.</li>
      <li>This is such a pretty soft pink, towel is good sized for me and is also soft to the feel yet soaks up the water quickly.</li>
      <li>I have tried other brands and these are my favorite for both feel and absorbency.  </li>
      <li>Before I received my acquis microfiber body towel, lisse crepe, pink (29 x 55-inches), I suffered from an unidentified viral syndrome, leprosy, fallen arches, and acid reflux, all of which vanished with the very first use of this extraordinary item.</li>
      <li>They absorb a lot of water and dry very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Soft touch &amp; zero smell (wet-cotton towels smell after first use).</li>
      <li>She commented especially how quickly it dries her hair.  </li>
      <li>There is no way the individual towel wrap would of worked for my long thick hair, but this was perfect.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>drawback now is the high price tag...</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend these.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These towels are great.  They absorb so much water but still stay lightweight and dry so quickly.  I started with just one for me to take on a trip and we now have two per person in our household, some with this waffle weave pattern and others with.  I have tried other brands and these are my favorite for both feel and absorbency.  We don&#x27;t use the other thick towels anymore after showering, everyone prefers these.  And they dry so fast!  Just amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my aged Mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel I&#x27;d bought her was just too heavy for her to handle.  She *adores* the microfiber towels I got her!  They are light for her weak arms, they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that&#x27;s particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly.  Not to mention that I, a hearty creature in my prime, love these towels too! I shall be buying more of various styles and colors.</li>
    <li> Just got back from a backpacking trip through europe and this towel was great. Easy to pack, quick to dry, and big enough to cover everything when some hostels provide less privacy than you are used to.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. Quick drying towels. Soft touch &amp; zero smell (wet-cotton towels smell after first use). I highly reccomend these.</li>
    <li> Love these towels because they are so incredibly absorbant and take up very little space in your luggage or gym bag.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received towel today. I wanted to try it out before I go on the SGK 3 day walk. My hair is very thick. I showered and wrapped hair in towel. There is no way the individual towel wrap would of worked for my long thick hair, but this was perfect.  The event is late September therefore the weather begins to get cooler. There are no electric outlets to dry hair so I wanted to try out one of these Aquis microfiber body towels. I have tried out other microfiber towels and I didn&#x27;t like the texture. Well, this is different. I really like it and recommend it for anyone that wants a thin lightweight absorbent towel. It will be great to take to my 3 day event and it&#x27;s PINK. I think I will order a second one. For some reason the darker colors cost more. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Had one years ago,still using it! I purchased two because my 21 yr old grandson loved mine too! They wash well too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this towel. It was recommended to me by a friend because I have severe back problems and this towel works well if you have limited mobility. It is like a shamy, but soft. It is also very absorbant. It does not irritate my skin at all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Before getting one of these I bought a Turkish towel which was quite absorbent and very plush and snuggly. I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied with the absorbency so I decided to try these, all I can say is WOW! All you need to do is put it on your skin and it will absorb every last drop, none of that dampy feeling you get with most towels. They also dry VERY quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so they&#x27;re not the most decorative looking but they do the job, so much so that I&#x27;ve ordered more. Even my usually very cynical husband was blown away by how efficient these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you care about absorbency more than looks these are the towels for you.</li>
    <li> So I know this towel is pretty expensive in terms of bath towels, but believe me when I say it is SO worth it! Yes, people are correct when they say it \\&quot;clings\\&quot; to your skin, but the way to use it is to blot instead of vigorously rubbing the towel against your skin. This towel will leave your body and hair fuzz-free, AND for those of you ladies with frizz-prone hair, it is WAY better than a cotton towel. I have extremely frizzy hair, with flyaways, and this towel reduces the frizz dramatically! It also reduces drying time dramatically, which is great if you like to shower right before bed, so now you don&#x27;t have to wait forever for your hair to dry (if you prefer air-drying like I do). The towel is durable and yet extremely soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these towels! So glad I tried them. No regrets! Back for more! Wish they had more colors!</li>
    <li> the  pink is perfect, the crepe is delicious to the touch and capaciously absorbent, the little aquis label is subtle, even distinguished, in a modernist sort of way. You can pat yourself dry; you needn&#x27;t rub. Before I received my acquis microfiber body towel, lisse crepe, pink (29 x 55-inches), I suffered from an unidentified viral syndrome, leprosy, fallen arches, and acid reflux, all of which vanished with the very first use of this extraordinary item. With the religious fervor of the healed, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and just as absorbant as is advertised.  I really wish it came in other colors and regular towel sizes!(bath sheet size).  It does a better job than my expensive Turkish towels, and it dries faster too.  It looks like it is being marketed as a towel for pets, but I like it for myself!  I got one for my mom, who is very frail and can&#x27;t handle using a heavy bath towel and she likes hers very much also.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Works well for my dog who is allergic to cotton of all things!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000AMBF2A Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel, Seafoam, Extra Large (29 x 55-Inches)]]    This is the second set of microfiber towels I have purchased; this set is so I can have one set in the wash and not have to rush to dry them.  I only need wash these towels once a week, sure saves on laundry anyway.    I am spoiled with the instant dryness these towels bring, using a cotton towel now is such a lengthy chore.    These towels are well worth the money, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> I brought this along on a two week trip to the Amazon.  It was easy to wash, dried quickly and light to carry.  Could not ask for more!</li>
    <li> Just as it advertised, it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly.  I bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out, well, I am sold on this product. &lt;br /&gt;Only drawback now is the high price tag...</li>
    <li> I understand why many people like Aquis microfiber towels.  They are lightweight, dry hair quickly, and compact in the washing machine.  For someone who wants a lightweight towel for travel, camping, because of weak arms or hands, or because they pay by the pound to have their laundry washed, there are advantages.  On the other hand, I find the texture unpleasant and the towels tend accumulate an unpleasant, almost mildew-y odor over time which washing can&#x27;t remove.  I used these loyally for a couple of years to dry my hair, but eventually I threw them out in disgust and returned to my French waffle-weave towels which are more expensive and harder to find but equally absorbent, extremely durable, always fresh-smelling, and pleasant to touch because they are 100% cotton.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these towels for MANY years - 10-15 and they wear like iron.  It is soft and dries you off very quickly.  I use mine for the gym.  At the end of showering and dressing, I drape it over a hanger in my car on the garment hook and it dries while I am in the office for the day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one for my son&#x27;s girlfriend for her to use at the gym and she loves it. She commented especially how quickly it dries her hair.  This size is generous enough to wrap yourself to if need be.  Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> After using the Aquis hair towel for many years I decided to try the body towel.  Another great product.  Is travels well too!</li>
    <li> The towel is fine, it doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as a regular towel so it&#x27;s good for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The pink color became very dull  and faded after only one washing. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed about&lt;br /&gt;the nasty looking color however the towel absorbs moisture very well. I think the white one&lt;br /&gt;would have been a better option.</li>
    <li> The Aquis Microfiber Body Towel is excellent. I purchased it to take with me on my European back packing trip. Not only was the towel absorbant put it was lightweight, easy to pack, and dried quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The seller is on time with my order always.  Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Products arrived quickly and undamaged.  Towel colors were not true to description, and so, disappointing.  I returned them.  I have been purchasing microfiber towels from Aquis for years, the quality is wonderful.  I was so happy to find them again, AND at Amazon.  It seems many stores no longer carry them.  I may try again -- but in different colors!    -Diana</li>
    <li> I love this item. I received it as a gift and now use it every single day. My hair dries so much faster after having been wrapped up in this. That&#x27;s great b/c now I do not have to blow dry as much, so my hair seems to be getting a lot healthier. Only complaint would be that it does not stay wrapped very well. Not sure if it&#x27;s the material or the size, but nonetheless, it still works great. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this large one for my long hair, and it doesn&#x27;t make any difference for drying time. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past 6 weeks and I am totally satisfied with this towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my big fluffy cotton towel that I kept at the gym with this one.  The cotton seemed to never fully dry out day after day and would start to smell funky before wash day.  This towel absorbs water off my body very quickly and thoroughly... I hang it on my locker hook and it is dry the next day and has never gotten mildewy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel is the perfect size for me (I am tall and have a medium body build).  Covers me modestly all through the locker room.  Pretty color, soft and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Washes up great, dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the smaller version of this same towel for my hair.  They make a great set for after workout at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Jan 2010.... I am still using this same towel every day at my gym.  I leave it in my locker overnight and it is always dry and fresh when I need it again... never moldy or mildewy.  I take it home on the weekend to wash and it always cleans up nicely.  Great towel!  So glad I have it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous towels for drying your hair in the smaller size.</li>
    <li> This towel is terrific!  I love the texture, slight stretch and that it dries quickly. I have one for my hair and am delighted to have the larger body towel. This is perfect for gym! It greatly reduces the weight of my gym bag.</li>
    <li> Very nice microfiber and is very absorbent. One towel for my Weimaraner! Has held up nicely and I have been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> I love these towels.  They absorb a lot of water and dry very quickly.  I wish Aquis would continue making this style towel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these Aquis towels before, and I purchased this one due to the size - previously they were only available in small sizes. This is body size, and to my surprise, the surface feels better so that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;snag\\&quot; your skin as you rub it. And it still does its job - making you dry.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this towel to put my shampooed hair up before I dry it. It reduces the drying time and isn&#x27;t heavy on my head like a regular bath towel. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I seem to be always trying to find a really good bath towel. I do NOT like that velvet stuff...This is such a pretty soft pink, towel is good sized for me and is also soft to the feel yet soaks up the water quickly. I am very pleased with these and would purchase again. They seem well made and they are great to wrap my long hair up after washing that too...These really seem to be quality. They dry fast also. Arrived on time and are nicely packaged. These are not real thick nor fluffy....I did not want those fluffy towels that people put our for company and they don&#x27;t make drying off easy...I love, love the color. Not at all scratchy either. I&#x27;ll think I&#x27;ll see if they make a wash cloth for the face.</li>
    <li> What a nice towel!  It dries the body, and itself very quickly.  Great for travel!  I have one for my hair, so I wanted to try a larger one for the body, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick hair which most of the super absorbent towles can&#x27;t contain enough for me to get the benefits. This one is big enough to contain all my hair and really pulls tje water out. Cuts my drying time way down weather I use a dryer or air dry. Very light weight and dries pretty quick.</li>
    <li> The towel dries very quick and throughly.  I just wished it was a little thicker. The size is okay for me at 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34;.</li>
