<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well and it comes with this cage/stand thing that you set the curler inside while it&#x27;s heating up.  It&#x27;s cool... little things like that impress me :)</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works good with long hair. It&#x27;s to big for short hair.</li>
    <li> this gets really hot, and I love the wider size but it hasn&#x27;t worked as smoothly as my last one for waves, it&#x27;s awesome for straightening my thick wavy hair though. Hopefully it&#x27;s a user error on the curls/waves. I&#x27;ll add to my review if it gets better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several higher end ceramic flat iron brands that cost over $100 each, but honestly the results I get with my Conair Infiniti are just as smooth and straight. I actually prefer it to a CHI because the plates seem smoother and don&#x27;t snag my hair like a CHI sometimes does. I&#x27;ve used this iron for several years now, and it&#x27;s holding up great. There are four different heat settings, and two of them over 400 degrees. I like having the option of a higher heat setting for the wavier sections of my hair that really need some serious straightening. This is a great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have thick curly hair that tends to frizz.  This iron straightens my hair with no problem and keeps it straight.  My hair is smooth, straight, and frizz free even when it is raining and humid out.  I only have to run it over my hair once or trice to get it completely straight so it has been a time saver for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron when I accidentally left my ancient CHI flat iron at my parents after the holidays.  I love my CHI and it has, in styling appliance terms, held up for an eternity.  I would have gladly purchased another CHI except for the price.  I had major concerns about the Infiniti Pro after reading reviews mentioning that it snags their hair, but at such a reasonable price, I had to try it. I was a little tentative using it the first time, but I&#x27;m happy to report there weren&#x27;t any snags!  I do have very thick hair and I think this may help keep the floating plates from pulling or snagging.  I love the digital temperature controls and that it heats up super-fast.  I&#x27;m able to straighten a large section of hair at the same time which has cut styling time.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this iron....it is absolutely my favorite beauty tool. lol....I&#x27;ve tried many flat irons and this by far is the best.  I tried one of those flat iron that they sell at a kiosk at the mall and it doesn&#x27;t even compare.  The price is way affordable.  Go give it a try.... I love the shine it does to my hair. The others just make it frizzy, dry looking.</li>
    <li> Gets your hair right!</li>
    <li> I still have this flat iron to this day</li>
    <li> works good. Not sure why I don&#x27;t love it. Relatively easy to use. My very old one would let me touch the outside of the plates. I can&#x27;t on this one so that is why I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to be straight and looking good yes its the best</li>
    <li> Pretty good flat iron for the price. Bought it when my more pricey and professional flat iron broke and went in for repair. Now use it as a back up since it does nearly the same job as the expensive model!</li>
    <li> I used my friend&#x27;s straightener once and loved it so I had to get my own! It makes my hair silky every time. I have fine hair so I tend to get a lot fuzzy \\&quot;flyaways\\&quot; which this straightener tames well enough. The best I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
    <li> I have thick, course, naturally wavy-curly hair that can be a frizzy nightmare (especially in the humid summers we have here on the east coast).  I have used other flat irons, and NOTHING works like this does.  I have the 1 1/2 inch.  My hair is cut in a \\&quot;bob\\&quot; style just below my chin and I have some long fringe like bangs around my face.  To avoid my hair from \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; in the back, I&#x27;ve had to use a curling iron and curl it under, which was not my first choice.  With this, I was able to make it totally straight with one pass. Turning my coarse, frizzy hair into a smooth beautiful style.  My hair moves at the slightest tilt of my head which is rare for me.  I love this flat iron and am so glad I bought it.  One word of caution:  It gets EXTREMELY HOT!  Mine goes up to 455 degrees F.  Since my hair is so thick and resistant to going straight, I use the higher setting, but don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair every day which is nice.  It lasts.  Since the iron gets so hot, remember not to touch the hair you just straightened or you might burn your finger.  Also, use good conditioning shampoos and conditioners, and a heat protecting syrum or oil to help save your hair and make it shiny.</li>
    <li> The flat irons worked very well. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them and they met all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love it except my hair still gets caught in the corners other wise it would have received a 5 star. Best one I have ever used. Love the ability to change temperatures and love the wide area. A must have!!! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Heats up and straightens hair extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent, easy to use, great results.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It was awesome for a month and a half.  And then just died.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  Both my daughter and I use it often and we are both having great results.  My daughter is \\&quot;addicted\\&quot;!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this iron, it cuts time in half for me to straighten my natural kinky-thick african american hair. It didn&#x27;t cost me much and due to this economy, that&#x27;s a wonderful deal. I do not need to use it eveyday, however I think that it will last me for awhile. It has a 5 year warranty on it that will be honored by FOLICA. Though, the color in the picture is not accurate, it still has this cool burgandy-red looking hue. I also like that it can reach up to 445 degrees, the 1 1/2\\&quot; inch plates gets close to my roots with ease, it doesn&#x27;t smoke that bad on it&#x27;s high heat setting, and last, but not least...there is hardly any residue on it&#x27;s plates after use! ;)smiles!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this for christmas to replace her aging unit. The difference in time it takes to straighten her hair is night and day. Definitely a plus for me!</li>
    <li> Perfect flat iron.  Heats up super fast.  Easy to use on my long very wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Hair straightener is for my girlfriend. She used it and said it was great. Have to update on the longevity of it, otherwise it&#x27;s nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Much better than the others I have tried. But, Be careful it does get very very hot. Much faster time to get hair done and I have extremely thick and long hair.</li>
    <li> I had researched and researched straighteners, I came across this one and decided to give it a try although the price was a bit steep. In my opinion, it was worth every penny! My hair is highlighted blonde and is thin. This is the first straightener that I have purchased that actually makes my hair appear thicker. Because my hair is so thin by the end of the day it gets wavy and no longer looks like its been straightened. However, with this product it still appears straight at the end of the day. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is the second infinity pro I have purchased.  The first one is wonderful, one year later.  The second one lasted 3 weeks and out of nowhere stopped working.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, so I&#x27;m not a veteran of this type of tool but I think it&#x27;s great. It heats up quickly, and does an awesome job of straightening my long fine hair. Totally a game changer if you have stubborn hair texture like I do. It gives my hair a shiny smooth look and my hair licks don&#x27;t stand a chance. I can finally experiment with lots of different looks. I love it and have been getting so many compliments on my hair these days. It&#x27;s been about a month now and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think twice and don&#x27;t look anywhere else. BEST HAIR STRAIGHTER EVER! My last one was from Costco and it stopped heating after so many yrs. I loved that one completely as well.  When it died,  I decided to buy the same brand. Found it Amazon at a great price and ordered this one which is an extra 0.5 inch.  I have really bad afro hair.  It took less than 3 mins to get it straightened and with  a silky smooth finish. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Buy it..buy it.. BUY IT! Btw, I didn&#x27;t get paid to write this.</li>
    <li> This flat iron in the 1.5 inch is perfect for me.  I had been using an old 2 inch flat iron that was cumbersome and did not get anywhere near as hot as this one.  I ordered this one based on all the reviews and I am not disappointed.  I would say this is the best flat iron you can buy for the price.  I was able to straighten my entire head of really long, very curly hair in 30 minutes on the second to highest temp.  My hair was professional straight looking.  I never actually straighten my whole head regularly.  I just flat iron the top some and kind of loosen some of the curl with the flat iron.  I haven&#x27;t even tried to flatten my whole head in years because the irons never did a good enough job....well, this one was amazing..it gets incredibly hot.  I love the protective holder too.  I pop it in there still hot, no problem.  One small complaint that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much,  the paint on the sides of the flat iron where the plates are has scraped off easily.  Maybe from being slid into the holder?  It works so well at such a great price point that I see it as a none issue.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I purchased this straighter almost 4 years ago, and it still straightens my hair nicely! It&#x27;s used frequently, too. I have curly, frizzy hair; it take about 15 minutes, or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with it now is that the button to make the heat higher is now lagging, so I&#x27;m defenitally buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the worst straightener I have every had. Thought it was great at first, ten months into having it it no longer heats up. Has warranty, customer service won&#x27;t do much to help get it fixed. Will be buying a different brand from now on!</li>
    <li> love it get nice and hot and hair stays straight for a lonnnnggg period of time. only thing is hair appears frizzy at 1st once you wrap it and let it down it is silky straight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 5 straighteners in my life and this is one of my favorite.  This is the smallest I&#x27;ve had so far so that is taking some getting used to but I love how it leaves my hair feeling so silky, almost like the salon does.  It heats quickly and the holder is fantastic, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off the counter or my two year old grabbing the plates when I have it on.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is better than a herstyler and babyliss which are both pricey.  I have thick, course, African American hair (no relaxer/perm) and this  flat iron did wonders.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have bought &amp; returned 5 flat irons this month to try &amp; find the perfect fit for me...  The Infinity Conair 1 1/2\\&quot; is the best of the bunch at a reasonable price...  My hair is a STACKED BOB...so every hair needs to be in place for it to fall properly...  I&#x27;ve used the Infinity before...but this one is new &amp; improved...Yes it is improved..  Glides over hair perfectly...allowing control &amp; placement of the hair to fall properly...  leaves my hair shiny so my highlights show up perfectly...  I&#x27;m going to buy another one just to have it on reserve... because anything I uses seems to  be discontinued...I highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> This iron heats up very quickly and has nice controls. However, even though it straighens my hair, it leaves it looking sort of dry and stiff rather than soft and smooth. My previous iron did a much better job, although that one stank of chemicals so I had to throw it out. One day I hope to find the right iron that isn&#x27;t professional-grade-expensive, but does a better than &amp;#34;hair-looks-like-wheat&amp;#34; job like this one.</li>
    <li> After trying a variety of brands &amp; sizes of flat irons over the last 15 years, this is the best bang for my buck. Leaves my hair shiny &amp; silky smooth like after a salon visit for a lot less than the CHI my stylist uses!</li>
    <li> It claims on the box &amp;#34;floating plate.&amp;#34;... SINGULAR. Both plates are NOT floate. And the one plate that does &amp;#34;float,&amp;#34; only floats on one side of the plate. When you close the flat iron, the plates don&#x27;t even touch so it doesn&#x27;t even grasp your hair on one side. Pretty design, but flat out stupid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Conair for 3 years now and its worked fairly well. I use it almost everyday and I travel with it a lot and it still works great. I have one area on the underside of my hair where it grows extremely curly, which is where the hair straightener comes in but sometimes my conair just won&#x27;t straighten it and i&#x27;ll have to give up and put my hair in a bun.   ~PROS~  -gets hot really fast  -keeps my hair shiny and soft as it does not fry it   -for the most part it straightens really well  ~CONS~  -Cord twists and tangles VERY easy  -takes forever to cool down  -some days it just will not straighten your hair, and if it does it wont STAY straight  -you have to go over your hair 2-3 times to get it straight</li>
    <li> Gave one to my daughter and she says she Loves it!!</li>
    <li> OMG. I absolutely LOVE these flat irons. I just so happened to run across them on youtube and I had to have them. They get super hot super quick. You only have to run them through your hair once and the results are incredible. It&#x27;s just like going to the salon. Take my word and save money, by buying these today, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! I have another conair straightener + curler that I was using for years but it&#x27;s now only really good for curling. My other flat iron, a Helen of Troy, wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough and the ceramic was cooked off to the metal plates beneath making it an uneven heat to my hair. So, I purchased this flat iron and I am so impressed! It gets hot REALLY fast - I plugged it in and it was already getting warm! I have thin hair but slot of it so I have pseudo thick hair and it would either take me forever to straighten or it wouldn&#x27;t stay- not with this! I got the 1.5 inch plates and it took me not even 10 mins to straighten and it has pretty much stayed the whole day! Very, very happy!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! I had another popular high end brand straightener and it did not do nearly as good of a job as this straightener does.  Heats up fast and has multiple heat settings.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have the bigger plug with the red and black buttons but just plugs right into the socket.  This way I can have my straightener and hair dryer plugged in at the same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and have used top of the line... I purchased this for my sister... I bought mine 3 years ago in a supermarket. I am mixed, asian and black and this does great in my hair. I originally purchased because the setting goes up over 400 degrees for the keratin treatment. I now use it for my own personal use and it has never damaged or dried my hair out. I would say make sure you always use a heat protectant cream/serum for hair and please DO NOT go over the hair more than once! Makes me cringe when I watch people go 3 and 4 times over the same part of hair. The setting goes really high so you only need to go over once. Dont go crazy with the high heat setting! Really amazing how I spend a lot of money on different plated flat irons, chi was one of them and this one worked great!</li>
    <li> Plus: The straightener was new/shipped promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus: the straightener does not get hot. I put it on the highest temp yet it feels warm rather than hot. :(</li>
    <li> My daughter and niece suggested I order this, they both said it was very very good so I purchased it and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It works beautifully on my hair and make it very straight. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use at a vacation house we have so I wouldn&#x27;t have to drag my everyday flat iron (different brand) back and forth. After using it TWO TIMES, it quit working!  Unfortunately, I ordered this several months ago, so I&#x27;m sure any chance of returning or replacing it will be out of the question. I&#x27;ve had other brands that have worked for YEARS; I can&#x27;t believe this one quit after two uses. I should have known to spend a little more and buy a quality item. Id give this no stars if that were an option.</li>
    <li> It gets very hot so watch the settings for first use, but definitely worth the purchase.  I was hesitant but I would buy another one is it died on me.</li>
    <li> I love my flatiron!!! It gets hot really fast and it only takes me 20 minutes to do my hair. The past flatiron I had was the wet to straight one and it took me over an hour to do my hair.</li>
    <li> amazing !!!! really love it</li>
    <li> This straightener works well and costs far less then my last one!  Like the wider plate size.  Bought one for my daughter too.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I broke my previous infiniti Pro and bought a Chi...horrible product so went back to find another Infiniti Pro. They don&#x27;t make the one i originally had but this one is just as good. Heats up quickly, straightens and curls very well  (really really well!), and the buttons are not stupidly located. I actually bought a 2nd one as a backup :)</li>
    <li> was so surprised by the quality of this straightener. doesnt burn my hair, leaves it smooth, straight and shiny! LOVE it. worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great product gets hot fast...great price compared to other irons I&#x27;ve bought. .I need to buy another one now before they get popular and the price goes up. I&#x27;m s professional stylist and it&#x27;s hard to impress me..I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as expected</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener that I have ever used. Heats up super fast and will straighten anything! Even a pony tail bump!</li>
    <li> I received the Infiniti Pro by Conair 1 1/2 inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron for Christmas from my husband after my other one quit working a few weeks prior. I had specifically requested a new flat iron for Christmas and told him not to worry about getting one too expensive because I didn&#x27;t straighten my hair much anymore since it usually takes me 30-45 minutes and I just don&#x27;t have the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the chance to try out my new Infiniti Pro I was so excited! It worked wonders on my hair and only took 20 minutes. Mainly because the settings are more precise and the ceramic plates were very smooth and didn&#x27;t pull or frizz my hair like my old straightener. Where it used to take me two, sometimes three passes on the same section of hair, the Inifiniti Pro would straighten it in a single pass, without having to go slow and risk burning/damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be straightening my hair a lot more often now since it won&#x27;t take 30+ minutes to do it.  This flat iron has 5 optimal heat settings that go up to 455 degrees Fahrenheit with a simple &amp;#34; + &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; - &amp;#34; button. I was highly impressed with it and would actually compare it to my mom&#x27;s Chi, which I have borrowed several times and loved. (I just can&#x27;t see paying $100 for a straightener, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great straightener that is budget friendly, I would high recommend the Infiniti Pro by Conair with tourmaline ceramic plates! At less than $35, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this. My hair is really thick, and it took ages to straighten it and even then, it wasn&#x27;t even that straight, it was still kind of wavy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading many many reviews.  This gets the job done for sure.. It gets super hot, super fast, and if I iron my hair at the top heat temp, my hair smells &amp;#34;cooked&amp;#34;.  So I lower the heat a bit, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have thick course curly hair. Even with oil on humid days and rain it won&#x27;t keep my smoothness. Well this product does. It does exactly what it says. It rained today hard and my hair is still smooth and frizz free. It&#x27;s a great product I highly recommend it. I put oil at the ends and back of my hair and sides. Everywhere but the top and bangs. I love this straightener.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is  very hot and heats up quickly.  I have to use the low setting to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast and very effective in straightening long hair. I got the 1 1/2&amp;#34; one and it was tougher to curl than I thought but for straightening its amazing!</li>
    <li> The item I received was used. I have sent several e-mails in regards this item asking for a refund and nobody has reply back to my e-mail. I even attached some pictures. One of them showed a hair stucked in the flat iron.  I  was very upset to received a used flat iron, and now I am extremely disappointed of the service.</li>
    <li> I purchased this today and I am amazed by the results. I was a little skeptical at first, given that it was only $34. I have very long, thick hair and the temp on this thing gets way up there which works amazing with my hair. I was able to cut the time it takes to straighten my hair in half! Hair is Silky smooth and does not burn your hair on the high setting. I also like that it is a little wider than most flat irons, but definitely works best for hair like mine. I would definitely reccommend this iron!!!!! :) I also really like there is a safety, heat guard that goes with it to place over the iron when its heating up and also works as a stand. BUY THIS PRODUCT! dont waste your money on those other expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! Be careful though--it gets really hot! But it is great for that sleek straight look which for my hair, especially on hot humid days is hard to get and maintain.  Using this though I have had no problems and it heats up fast for those who are busy and need to go!</li>
    <li> This broke within the first week. Bad product.</li>
    <li> Quick heating and automatic shut off.  Like the blade width also. Works great on my thick hair.  I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new flat iron since mine has kind of fallen apart.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much and saw all of the great reviews for this one and they were right!  This flat iron works better than my over $100 one did.  I&#x27;m so happy with it I bought one for my BFF and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the greatest. It heats up very quickly and it works very well. I hardly have any bad hair days because this is a quick way to straighten my hair without waiting for it to get hot. I have nothing negative to say about this product. It leaves my hair silky and straight the next morning after I wake up. I do highly recommend using heat protection. If you leave it in the same spot for too long your hair can end up smelling burnt! So use a heat protector.</li>
    <li> This was my first flat iron purchase, and I must say I am quite pleased.  I have super thick hair, so I was surprised that I can actually flat iron all of it within 15 minutes.  It heats up quick and works quite well.  I&#x27;ve never bought one of the over-expensive flat irons before, but I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would when this one works just great.  I read a lot of reviews before choosing this one, and came to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to spend $100+ on a flat iron.  This one works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This Flat Iron does a terrific job of getting hair straight and shiny without burning the hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this, I had the instyler which took so long for me to flat iron my whole head. with this I can just slide down and it done. literally flows down hair smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron ..great price. .has an auto shut off.</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of long, thick frizz-prone hair and I&#x27;ve found that this does as good a job as much more expensive flat irons (e.g. Solia). I have had it for 6 months and it is still working well.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener so when my other one began to smell, I had to get the same model. I had it for 2 years which is actually the longest a straightener has ever lasted me before. In the end nothing was wrong with it except for the fact that it smelled like burnt hair but I figured 2 years was enough and bought another. It is great, especially for the price, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Finally!!! For my type of hair (dry, thick, coarse, wawing, stubborn) this is the best Flat Iron to date. It heats fast, it works great. It works even better with the Scalpmaster Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener, which is a godsend, no more touching hot hair with my fingers. After blow-drying my hair I touch the ends with &amp;#34;Schwartzkopf got2b dry oil hair taming mist&amp;#34;.(If you have very dry, thirsty hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is not to be used on wet, semi-wet hair!!! Dry your hair completely, then use the styling mousse, gel or oil of your choice, in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived without any kind of defects, so I understand some reviews here: It Happens.</li>
    <li> I like it! It heats up quickly and works great.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic flat iron! I have long wavy curly hair and this works great. I never have to use it on the highest setting. I use it 1/2 ways or maybe the 4th setting. It comes with a little holder so i unplug it in the morning and slip it into the holder to cool off and that way my kid and pets don&#x27;t have to risk getting accidentally burned. It gets VERY hot so be careful! I burned my scalp the first time I used it. Now I got the hang of it and I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase a new flatiron. What a difference.</li>
    <li> Ok, it&#x27;s a pretty good styling tool. It has lots of settings. It heats up (a LOT!) quickly, it cools off pretty fast. It has a nifty stand so you don&#x27;t scorch your countertop. It&#x27;s well made, not wobbly for flimsy at all.  Maybe it&#x27;s just because I lack a lot of experience with these things, but I FRIED my long hair first time out. I&#x27;m still cutting out the damage I did almost a year ago. (Long hair, not chopping off!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just saying they make this look a lot better on TV. It does give a nice wave to my very straight hair, but so did my 1980&#x27;s model curling iron. (only that took waay longer) I still use it but not very often because of the &#x27;fry factor&#x27;. Be careful, girls. It takes a long time to grow your hair back out.</li>
    <li> Works great and love the color. Heats up so fast and love the digital temp setting.  Very easy to use.  Conair did great with this one.</li>
    <li> Built well and goes through hair really smoothly</li>
    <li> Works well but did not receive the protective heat shield</li>
    <li> This straightener works just as well as any other I&#x27;ve owned. I have fine hair so I tend to keep the heat as low as possible, but it does take a few swipes to remove bends and frizz from my ends. Heats up very quickly which is great in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Looked used and had a scratch</li>
    <li> It does what it claims. Still can&#x27;t figure out how to use the stand.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife when her CHI straightener bit the dust. This has been a great value for the money and was ranked well by consumer reports. Heats up quickly, has variable temp settings, and comes with a nifty heat shield that will allow you to hang it on a hook. 1-1/2&amp;#34; Plates do a great job going through long hair quickly. Slightly upset that the cord isn&#x27;t a GFCI style one that will trip on a short, but most bathroom outlet should already do that as they should be GFCI already.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and this iron leaves it staticky and unmanageable​. Do your research, I&#x27;ll stick with my titanium plates!</li>
    <li> I ordered this, had a little problem with the shipping. But, Ive used it three times already and I LOVE it ! I will certainly recommend this to all my friends:)</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd iron I have purchased from  Conair. The first one stopped working, but I loved it so much that I bought another. I tried a few different models from a beauty supply store, but they pulled my hair out and didn&#x27;t straighten as well as this one. My hair is very long and curly. It is difficult to straighten without a really good iron. I would definitely recommend this iron for those who have had difficulty finding an  iron that straightens well and doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out or someone needing a higher temperature iron. I think this iron heats to 415 or 425. I have never had it up that high.</li>
    <li> I got the 1 1/2 inch to go alongside my beloved Wet to Straight that I&#x27;ve had for about 8 years. I love this straightener since it actualyl shows the temp, my Wet to straight just goes from 0-30. This thing really does heat up super fast and has a nice even heat and goes through my super tangly 4 feet long curly hair with ease!!! I love that I can press the tips if I want to and I love that it&#x27;s floating which is what I was looking for since I found that with my Wet to Straight I was getting better results by leaving just a teeeeny space between the plates, which is what this one offers. I recently had hand surgery and was worried that it would be hard to press down on and I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with that aspect (but my hand does get tired just because I have a lot of hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD have given it FIVE STARS if only the metal part of the handle didn&#x27;t get SUPER WARM! I did not read anything about that in the reviews I saw!!! But the handle gets SERIOUSLY warm! Not enough to actually burn or anything but hot enough that its very very uncomfortable and I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a hot glove to use with it. My wet to straight handles are cool to the touch and I don&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s that metal part there anyways??? But I&#x27;m otherwise very happy!</li>
    <li> 15 second heat up is my favorite feature, by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve had. I use it to also make curls and waves. Love it.</li>
    <li> it broke on my second time using it, and i got it on time but i would reccomend a way better product.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a gift for my granddaughter, a flat iron  was on her Christmas list...she requested the ceramic flat iron....she likes it.</li>
    <li> Love it but be careful!&lt;br /&gt;Great price and better than my expensive one.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smooth and straightens fly aways! Works great!</li>
    <li> My friend tried using my $150.00 CHI flat iron and told me, \\&quot;Get rid of this!\\&quot;  She recommended this Infiniti flat iron to me and I am glad she did.  This Infiniti flat iron is amazing and it only cost me less than a third of what I paid for my CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my CHI took over a minute to get hot enough to use, and even when it did, it only went up to 395 degrees Fahrenheit.  The Infiniti really heats up in about 15 seconds and the higher heat option is great for those with thick hair.  There are five heat levels available and it is easily visible at the side panel.  The flat iron closes quite evenly so you&#x27;re not left with random portions of not-straight hair.  I like the handle because it is easy to pull together.  It is not too tight where you&#x27;re having to uncramp your hand every now and then.  With my CHI I had to squeeze down the handles because the irons were uneven and the awkwardly thin handles left my hands cramped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron really does leave your hair frizz-free.  I have a full head of thick curly hair, and I was able to get great results in about 45 minutes to an hour (which is great for my hair type).  I thought a 1.5 inch size might be too small for taming my crazy hair, and contemplated the 2 inch size, but it works so good!  With straight or simple wavy hair, I would imagine you could finish your look in half that.  I always got sweaty after doing my hair but I found myself having to retouch it, if ever, only once, or twice on a humid day.  I guess that tourmaline thing really does work.  Compared to this, the CHI was horrible.  I took over an hour to do my hair and it didn&#x27;t even look good; AND I had to retouch it at least three or four times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this flat iron for over four months now and I have not encountered any problems with it yet.  I use it frequently, but it still heats up quick.  The few times that I dropped it to the floor, I did not see any damage.  It is quite a sturdy thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron comes with a small case for the top of the flat iron so keep it shut when stowed away.  This is great for those like me who rush, and don&#x27;t have time to wait for the flat iron to cool before putting it away.  Though I have not observed the auto shut-off feature with my flat iron yet, I think that safety feature is great.  The only thing I should add here is that when you use a flat iron routinely, you should always use a heat protectant spray.  I bought one by Thermasilk and I feel it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price.&lt;br /&gt;2. Quality.&lt;br /&gt;3.

    <li> Nice straightener. It has a variety of temperatures, not just a dial with 1-10. This thing gets HOT and it turns off after an hour (supposedly. I&#x27;ve not actually seen this work). The cord is long, which is nice because so many flat irons have like 1/2 inch cords and I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;how the heck is YOUR bathroom set up?!?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice it doesn&#x27;t get that gunky buildup of junk along the edge like other flat irons. I know that&#x27;s just product and hair grease or whatever, but it&#x27;s noticeably absent here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing---this gets HOT HOT HOT. I have burned my little ear so many times. The handle stays cool and you can touch the barrel part for the most part without burning your hand to a crisp, but the edges are hot so keep an eye on on your ear-flaps.</li>
    <li> The reviews weren&#x27;t lying! It heats up within seconds. I normally have to work on my make-up while I wait for my straightener to heat up but I literally press &amp;#34;ON,&amp;#34; brush my hair, and it&#x27;s ready. I have fine hair so the first or second setting does the trick. Pretty satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!  Heats up fast, high temps I LOVE it.  Best flat iron I have ever used. Makes hair smooth, shiny and stays for days</li>
    <li> i have had this product in the past, great flat iron. it indicates the actual temp. i like this item.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve purchased other flat iron from stores I won&#x27;t name &amp; they only last for 6-8 months. I own conair curling iron that I&#x27;ve had for over 7 years. It&#x27;s beat up but still gets super hot. I&#x27;m happy with this particular flat iron. Also love the little stand holder that&#x27;s included. Can&#x27;t beat the price either! 👍</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best what I ever had</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of this straightener from around 2007 and it has just started to die. I&#x27;ve been so hesitant to purchase another one because mine worked so well and I was afraid that nothing else in this price range would compare. However, this straightener works extremely well. Heats up within seconds, and straightens my hair perfectly. No creases, no hair pulling. Perfect size, very light-weight. Extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome, amazing, works better than an expensive iron. Leaves my hair pin straight and protects from humidity ! I love this product. Take care of it and it will last! Had it for over 2 years and its still perfect. Before this hair iron I went thought about a dozen till I got this one. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really does what it says. I had a Bed Head straightener and it left my hair frizzy...not this one! I have smooth hair now and it straightens way better! Great service too!</li>
    <li> I wish it would have worked in my vehicles outlet. Otherwise, a good product.</li>
    <li> This worked wonders with my hair!! Ive had the same brand but broke it a couple weeks back this brand is cheaper than othernhair styling product with results that would probably have cost much kore at a salon.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and was very skeptical about getting this flat iron. It was recommended to me by a friend and I decided to try it after I had gone through my second chi flat iron. This has been a great product and has now lasted longer than the last chi I ordered. It completely straightens my hair which is great. I like the size of this flat iron as well.</li>
    <li> Works great and you can regulate the temperature. The material look really good quality and leaves the hair straight and soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron that i had ever buy, for this low price, the quality are very amazing.</li>
    <li> work perfect for my wife, thanks</li>
    <li> Works so perfect!! MUST BUY!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this in July 2012 - stopped working inexplicably October 2014.  Just refuses to turn on. Loved it but obviously not so much anymore.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy (almost curly) hair. I require very high heat to get my hair to cooperate, and have never had good results from drugstore brand styling tools. I always have to get the high heat ones from the beauty supply. I saw the good reviews for this iron while searching amazon for a good flat iron, so I decided to give it a try. I actually have to go over the hair twice to get it perfectly straight, but it leaves it so beautiful, that I don&#x27;t even care! My hair looks like silk!! No frizz whatsoever! I have tried all the &amp;#34;frizz free&amp;#34; sprays and serums and balms, and none of them really work- but this does. I LOVE this thing. I used it on my daughters, and they have less wavy hair, so I only have to go over it once on theirs, and it looks stick straight, shiny and beautiful! Seriously guys, get this flat iron, you will be so happy you did!</li>
    <li> Update:  two years later it&#x27;s still working great and holding together like new.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on an expensive model when this works perfectly well. I straighten my hair daily and this knocks the frizz out and I&#x27;ve only burned myself once (stupid me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review back in 2015: Heats quickly, stays hot, and hair just glides through it.  This was a replacement for a similar model I purchased at Costco about 5 years ago and it&#x27;s actually better.  I did find that when I wasn&#x27;t holding it &amp;#34;just so,&amp;#34; my fingers got too close to the plates and sure felt it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a $200 flat iron (new dog got to the cord-my fault). This iron isn&#x27;t as good as my ghd but it does a pretty good job for $30! Gets very hot with multiple heat settings while not frying hair. Plates are very smooth, hair glides through with ease. Had a slight burning smell when first turned on but it went away. Overall not too shabby!</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed by this straightener. I have Shirley Temple ringlets that took a little over an hour to straighten. The first time I used it it took half that time. I probably would have taken less if I didn&#x27;t go over the same section multiple times out of habit. All my hair really needed was two passes to be totally straight. It heats up very very quickly and I love the stand that it comes with. The only drawback for me is that the cord is not as long as I would like it to be, but for the performance, it is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve wanted to switch from the large curling rod to a flat iron but never saw anything I really wanted to try. Then I saw this one on Amazon and read all the great reviews so I bought it. One word LOVE!  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it now.... Works fab on my hair which is on the thinner side.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 6 months, I love it. Works great for straightening or curling my hair. Heats up quickly and automatically shuts itself off over time if you forget to turn it off.</li>
    <li> I just got this in last week and I have to say it&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever owned!  The size is perfect, there are little ribs on the side where you put your fingers that help you grab the right spot.  The iron doesn&#x27;t make the side where you grab too hot for your fingers.  It shuts off by itself, has an easy to see temperature gauge so you can see if it&#x27;s on and how hot you want it (love that it&#x27;s adjustable heat).  Best of all, it shuts off when you forget! Some flat irons seem to crisp my hair, this one does not.  I highly recommend it, I would love to buy a curling iron with all these features exactly!</li>
    <li> Great performance for a modest price, very easy to use and has several heat settings to choose from for every hair type.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well, and I like the additional surface area of the 1 1/2 inch wide iron.  The only thing I would change about it is the length of the cord....with it was about a foot longer.  Would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend &amp; she loves it. Her hair stays straight for an entire day &amp; even following morning.</li>
    <li> My wife used to take a lot of time straightening her hair now she only takes a few minutes, so it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use it stopped working!  Not reliable!</li>
    <li> My husband bought one for me in January as my early birthday present, Used it 2 times if that and then it stopped working. SO I gave the product the benefit of the doubt and said maybe it was defected so I went and purchased another one, got half way done with my hair and it shut off never to turn on again. Thank goodness the representatives at Conair are understanding so they promised to replace it after I send a $5 money order and mail it back. I guess ill send it and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  It heats up in a matter of seconds and has multiple temperature settings for different hair types.  I wish I would have bought the 1 inch instead of the 1 1/2 inch, but thats a personal preference and no reflection on the flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;m expressed by how good it works on my hair. I have curly and wavy hair that is also very frizzy and it straightens my hair. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  I have fine hair so do not use the high settings.  I am sure it can work on coarser hair.</li>
    <li> I did a bunch of research to figure out the difference between a $100 flat iron and a $20 one. After all my searching, I settled on this one realizing I don&#x27;t have to spend $100 to get an awesome flat iron.  I have very very very thick, frizzy, curly hair and this flat iron is awesome. I no longer look like I have straw for hair when I flat iron it. It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly (has a nice range of heat depending on your hair), cools down reasonably quickly and love the 1 1/2 size as it&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
    <li> I absolutely wanted to love this product since it did such a WONDERFUL job straightening (my somewhat difficult to straighten) hair! Unfortunately- after taking very good care of it- it BROKE a couple days ago...won&#x27;t heat up at all anymore no matter what setting I have it set to. I am so incredibly disappointed, as other straighteners I have owned have lasted at least 2, 3, 4+ years. I guess you get what you pay for with it being at such a low price point. However, I have no problem spending much more money on a product that will actually last. This was completely frustrating and a total disappointment. I owned for 40/45 days MAX!</li>
    <li> Not at all impressed with this iron. It snags/pulls hair and keeps shutting off in the middle of using it.  The only good thing I can say about it is it heats up quickly.  I bought it locally (not on amazon) and it will be getting returned.  I will spend a little extra and most likely invest in a chi.</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron last night from Kohl&#x27;s because they were sold out of the CHI iron. I have to rate this flat iron as a 5 star! I used it on my daughters waist length thick natural african american hair which turned out silky straight, absolutely beautiful!! The best results that I&#x27;ve gotten thus far when flat ironing her hair! I purchased this flat iron on sale for $44 and debated on returning and ordering it from Amazon due to the price difference. However, after using it and knowing that I received $10 in Kohl&#x27;s cash it all balances out so I will keep it. In all honestly I would have never chosen to order this flat iron from Amazon seeing my plan was to purchase a top of the line flat iron for up to $150; happy to say I was wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Heats up extremely fast&lt;br /&gt;Size is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Color is a beautiful pearlized pink&lt;br /&gt;Durable</li>
    <li> I have purchased much more expensive flat irons and I can honestly say, this flat iron works just as well if not, better, for the fraction of the price.  I am beyond pleased.  I am a black woman with naturally tightly curled hair.  This flat iron straightens my strands and keeps them straight for days and days and days!  It looks as if I have a relaxer! Do yourself a favor and purchase this iron :-)</li>
    <li> Amazing iron.  I owned the smaller one before so this one works just as well.</li>
    <li> Read the review in consumer digest and bought the product.&lt;br /&gt;The family loves it. I would surely recommend the make and model.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair &amp; this didn&#x27;t clamp all the way down for me.  It got hot &amp; didn&#x27;t pull, but i returned it anyway</li>
    <li> It is doing a good job so far.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one because I had the Conair infiniti 2&amp;#34; troumaline ceramic flat iron for 10 years before it gave out. It worked perfectly on my very thick, coarse hair right up until the last day.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;The price.&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 inch. size Only a 1/2 inch difference in size from my old one and It does not seem to take any extra time to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Limited 5 year warranty. (There is a  limited 5 year warranty, if you can provide the proof of purchase. I also found a place on the conair website that says: If the consumer does not have the original proof of purchase, the purchase date for purposes of the warranty will be the date of manufacture. My model has a copyright of 2014 on the carton. I am not sure if I can provide a dated proof of purchase when buying from Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;What I do not like about it:&lt;br /&gt; It is so light weight, it feels less sturdy than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I do not find the protective heat shield useful. (My first time turning on my flat iron I put it in the holster and it started steaming. Are you supposed to use it only when the iron is off? If so, why call it a heat shield.)</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, no problems.</li>
    <li> During the few weeks that it worked, I loved it. However, it quickly stopped working. I took it on a trip, and when I got there, it was dead. I&#x27;d packed it in my carry-on, and it was not abused in any way. I have no idea why it quit, but it seems to be a common problem with this device.</li>
    <li> Gets super hot! If you have kinky hair it will work great, but be careful because if you touch your hair right away it is very hot.&lt;br /&gt;I love the auto off feature. It did smell a little funky when we first got it, but that went away after a few uses. Got a second one for my daughter and she loves it too. As the other reviewers stated, the cord is short so you will have to find a place to do your hair near a mirror and a close outlet.</li>
    <li> My daughter complains that although it straightens her hair after the first day the flat iron smell like an old flat iron it has that burning smell.</li>
    <li> I have been searching a long time for a new straightener and found this one. I did a consumers report search and this straightener ranked in the top 5. I absolutely love it! It has different heat settings depending on your hair type and works perfectly. It&#x27;s extra long and small and sleek. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with 4C natural hair. It has never been relaxed and I havent used any heat on it in several years now. After straightening it is between my shoulder blades. I couldnt get it completely straight because the flat iron kept cutting off in the process. I had to run over my hair over and over to get it going. It didnt seem like it was hot at 455. It kept cutting off or something in the middle of me doing my hair. It took two hours to get it done. And the paint started to peel off and burn on the plates. The floating plate thing is cool but it seemed like I had to clamp down  EXTRA hard to get the heat through. I ended up wearing my hair in a bun anyway so the fact that it wasnt all the way straight wasnt too bad. But still for the money paid and how long it took to straighten, I almost missed my concert. My hair was detangled and everything but the heat and the burning of the paint was a hassle I could do without</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. My hair has an awesome shine and they heat up fast. Arrival time was right on schedule as stated.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love these great buy and they were delivered so quickly they do my hair really good and im hard to please when it comes to my hair but they thee job...</li>
