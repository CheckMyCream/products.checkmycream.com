      <li>Cute brush, but does nothing special to get tangles out for my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap brush and don&#x27;t believe for a minute that it won&#x27;t pull your hair out.</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s 60 years old and this brush pulls out a lot less hair, detangles amazingly, and is all around the perfect brush.</li>

      <li>The wet brush is way better!</li>
      <li>INSTANT STATIC AND FRIZZ</li>
      <li>Product arrived before estimated delivery and it exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I was willing to pay whatever because my girls hair gets do tangled.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s glittery and pretty</li>
      <li>Anyone claiming this brush is a &amp;#34;de-tangled&amp;#34; is most likely not telling the truth.</li>
      <li>works great for my granddaughters-long black hair!!!</li>
      <li>So-so results when brushing Grand Daughter&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
      <li>It works great wet or dry hair.</li>
      <li>The hairbrush is somewhat big for my hands, but I manage to comb her hair just fine and pull it up into a pony tail.</li>
      <li>It really does make a difference when brushing my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>It makes brushing my kids hair after bath time so much easier.</li>

      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t like this brush that much....</li>
      <li>Trying to get my money back on the three I got (there was a special</li>
      <li>Highly recommended...</li>
      <li>However the over all design is a little lightweight and bulky for my hands, I would like to see a better designed handle.  </li>
      <li>We got the brush very quickly, but I have to say that this brush is just like any other brush we have in the cabinet.</li>
      <li>She has long hair and it can become full of tangles.</li>
      <li>They work so nice and actually make a difference from the normal everyday brushes.  </li>
      <li>My 5 yr old daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore about doing her hair!</li>
      <li>I have long curly hair and this brush works much better than my old one but must use in shower when wet doesn&#x27;t work well alone or with just wetted hair.</li>
      <li>It pulls mine out just as much as one from the drug store that costs a third of what I paid for this.</li>
      <li>My daughter has straight hair that tangles easily, especially overnight.</li>
      <li>BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO GETTING OUT TANGLES WITHOUT A 7 YR OLD SCREAMING...</li>

      <li>I gave in to my 6 year old and bought her this.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t work for my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, returned it.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush for my daughter who has long hair and it is less effective than any wooden paddle brush.</li>

      <li>The only way I don&#x27;t pull out all my hair is if I use my Wet Brush first.</li>

    <li> So glad I found this type of brush.  It really does make a difference when brushing my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I bought it for my daughter and pulls less when brushing her hair. Plus it&#x27;s glittery and pretty</li>
    <li> granddaughter loved it - works well</li>
    <li> Product arrived before estimated delivery and it exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Worst hairbrush ever. I bought them online and they do absolutely nothing to get tangled out. I was willing to pay whatever because my girls hair gets do tangled. Trying to get my money back on the three I got (there was a special and I figured we could all have our own brushes). What a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and this brush works much better than my old one but must use in shower when wet doesn&#x27;t work well alone or with just wetted hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and the recipient says the brush does not work as described to untangle hair.</li>
    <li> Nice Brush!! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I feel like this hurts worse. My daughter likes it but it doesn&#x27;t take snarls out at all.</li>
    <li> Detangles nicely, but feels clunky to hold. It&#x27;s a little too pricey though. All in all, I&#x27;m satistifed.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! Second one I bought for my mother. Her hair is past her waist and she&#x27;s 60 years old and this brush pulls out a lot less hair, detangles amazingly, and is all around the perfect brush. Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> Kids love this. not much of a difference with regular brush though.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap brush and don&#x27;t believe for a minute that it won&#x27;t pull your hair out. It pulls mine out just as much as one from the drug store that costs a third of what I paid for this.</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter. Loves it! No more crying.</li>
    <li> Awful. Broke within 2 weeks. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you believe it. I gave in to my 6 year old and bought her this. Not only does it pull,but it doesn&#x27;t brush well either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my 3 year old daughter after she kept seeing them on tv.  She asked me to order her one because based on the commercial there wouldn&#x27;t be anymore fussing and hurting when we brushed her really long thick hair.  The color was very attractive to a child and makes it easy to find if you misplace your brush a lot like we do.  However the over all design is a little lightweight and bulky for my hands, I would like to see a better designed handle.  The use of the brush did cut down on the crying when we brush our hair drastically.  She&#x27;s complains that it hurts some but not near as much.  Overall for the intended purpose of getting the tangles out without all the fussing I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d decreased the fussing / whining / crying by 75% since before we had it so for the price I paid I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I paid full price for this product and the opinions stated are based on my use of it.</li>
    <li> We prefer the Wet Brush.</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T DO WHAT WE HOPED FOR---NICE AS A BRUSH BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO GETTING OUT TANGLES WITHOUT A 7 YR OLD SCREAMING...</li>
    <li> Was great for the first week or so, but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  We don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> The best brush around for long hair to get tangles out. My 5 yr old daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore about doing her hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece. She would always make such a fuss if you brushed her hair. This brush works great. She brushes her hair by herself now.</li>
    <li> This brush did not work as advertised. The only way I don&#x27;t pull out all my hair is if I use my Wet Brush first. I should have stuck to the Wet Brush. The rigid form of the brush is just not for me. I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick to &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as expected. The wet brush is way better!</li>
    <li> So-so results when brushing Grand Daughter&#x27;s long hair.  Bristles are really not long enough for thicker hair.  Will purchase the one for thick hair and give it another try</li>
    <li> was very pleased with this brush would recommend to other</li>
    <li> My girls love this.. They work so nice and actually make a difference from the normal everyday brushes.  Their hair looks fresh and clean every time they use it.</li>
    <li> this brush changed our lives! it works so well for our daughter&#x27;s hair and made hair brushing a breeze.</li>
    <li> I HATED it it doesn&#x27;t do any good for my hair. In fact I think it pulls my hair out! I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is to thick for this brush but it definitely didn&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, regular thickness and it snarls easily. The advertising shows it smoothing snarled hair like cutting through soft butter. Well unless I don&#x27;t know how to brush my hair, this does not work. In fact it&#x27;s worse than my regular, half as expensive, paddle brush. Bummer purchase.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> No better then any other brush for a girls long hair. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter has straight hair that tangles easily, especially overnight. This brush was a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tender headed  DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH</li>
    <li> Awful! Waste of money ... Do not recommend. I would not even give this one star</li>
    <li> my kids don&#x27;t cry anymore when I brush there hair. This is the only brush my daughter will use now</li>
    <li> This hairbrush did not work on my hair but works well for my husband and step daughter.</li>
    <li> This brush works great on my hair. It was delivered when it was supposed to be</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It makes brushing my kids hair after bath time so much easier. The brush is designed to not pull on the hair so much so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
    <li> Blessings in Holy Sound-Yeshua !&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this brush that much....bristles are too small for my use....others may like it though.&lt;br /&gt;Namaste,&lt;br /&gt;Omody</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several and given them to friends. They work great with no pulling!</li>
    <li> Great use for tangled hair after washing. I don&#x27;t have excessive hair but it was getting tangled after washing. No issue with this bush.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, returned it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I bought this brush for my daughter who has long hair and it is less effective than any wooden paddle brush. In fact, the paddle brush is better.  This brush is over rated. Anyone claiming this brush is a &amp;#34;de-tangled&amp;#34; is most likely not telling the truth. I bought this brush with an open mind thinking &amp;#34;just maybe there is a brush out there to end the crying with my daughter&amp;#34; but unfortunately, there are no magic brushes out there...I recommend buying a leave in conditioner to help with tangles because this brush is not the answer.</li>
    <li> This brush is not soft its hard and pulls your hair out not as good as the other brush that I brought it was black and green</li>
    <li> Snarls no more for long hair!!!!</li>
    <li> works great for my granddaughters-long black hair!!!</li>
    <li> Advertisement is misleading.  Granddaughter is disappointed.</li>
    <li> worst brush ever! DOENST DO AT ALL WHAT IT SAYS IT SHOULD DO!! The very FIRST brush through my hair... INSTANT STATIC AND FRIZZ CAUSED BY THE BRUSH!! AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!! ANd YES I purchased the brush correct to my hair type!</li>
    <li> After reading all the negative reviews on here about these brushes I was really discouraged and debated trying it at all. However I love it, and so does my hair.</li>
    <li> ThIs brush didn&#x27;t work any better than most of the tangle brushes on the market&lt;br /&gt;For me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it say AT ALL! Returned it and am so disappointed!</li>
    <li> Cute brush, but does nothing special to get tangles out for my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Interesting - this is a great idea but this brush can actually tangle hair and pull it out. I bought all 3 to try the different versions for different hair types to see if it was better or worst - it was the same....... Im not sure how this works</li>
    <li> My four-year-old daughter cried almost every morning when it was time to do her hair. She has long hair and it can become full of tangles. She saw the commercial for the Michel Mercier Detangling Brush and she would ask me if I could buy her the hairbrush. After reading the reviews for the product I decided to give it a shot. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m impressed! My daughter loves that this hairbrush doesn&#x27;t hurt when I am brushing her hair and best of all-there are no more tears! The hairbrush is somewhat big for my hands, but I manage to comb her hair just fine and pull it up into a pony tail. My daughter also loves that the hairbrush is &amp;#34;sparkly.&amp;#34; Overall, I think it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> My niece said this brush was horrible and hurt her when taking out the tangles in her hair so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> This product is an o.k. brush,  but nothing like they show on tv. It still breaks my hair and there was plenty of hairs stuck in the brush when I was done.</li>
    <li> My 2 girls saw this on an infomercial and wanted to try it, so I decided to get it for them for Christmas. We got the brush very quickly, but I have to say that this brush is just like any other brush we have in the cabinet. Still pulls hair and creates a TON of static. IMHO, a waste of $$.</li>
    <li> The detangler hairbrush came before the estimated arrival date and works perfectly.It works great wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I Question if this was a used hair brush. It came in three pieces. It will not say together. It was a waist of money.</li>
