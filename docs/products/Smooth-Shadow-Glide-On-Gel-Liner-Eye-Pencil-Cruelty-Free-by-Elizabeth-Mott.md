<li> /&gt;It has got a little bit of shimmer, but it&#x27;s not gaudy.</li>
<li> Who doesn&#x27;t like a little sparkle??</li>
<li> I used this ESPECIALLY on days when i feel or look tired.</li>
<li> I use it to add a little brightness to my lower lash line and it does the trick!</li>
<li> This liner stays on so long, it&#x27;s almost creepy.</li>
<li> For daytime, I draw a thin line and soften a bit with my eyeliner brush, for a softer look.</li>
<li> Blends poorly and looks like a silvery line below my brows.</li>

    <li> Goes on smoothly and gently....long lasting</li>
    <li> Amazing for water line.better than tarte inner rim liner.I&#x27;m going to buy raven next.the sparkle in the pearl is fantastic.bothered my eyes a bit 1st time but that happens cuz your not used to product.can use pearl on inner rim and staying power is great.tarte nude  inner rim is chalky,this is $10cheaper and 10 ×&#x27;s better..you should always try more than once before you decide you don&#x27;t like .</li>
    <li> I received this eye pencil in the Pearl shade last year in one of my Ipsy subscription bags. This is a great waterliner! I have very sensitive skin and eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has got a little bit of shimmer, but it&#x27;s not gaudy. It&#x27;s fairly natural looking and brightens up my eyes. It can easily be used for day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning though, I didn&#x27;t understand when I bought this that you HAVE to use a eye pencil sharpener to sharpen the entire package. This doesn&#x27;t twist or push up, which is interesting. I didn&#x27;t have a sharpener so I had to run out to get one. Not a big deal, but I felt I should disclose that.</li>
    <li> I originally received a sample of this product in a monthly ipsy bag and loved it.  I use it more as an eyeliner on my lids to make my eyes pop and to add some shimmer.  I highly recommend this product.</li>

    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve been using the mascara and was loving it, so I figured I&#x27;d try the eye pencil.  The pearl is wonderful for a natural look with a hint of shimmer.  Makes the eyes look huge and goes on so nicely. It lasted through a 9 hour work day with eye rubbing and sweat.  Anything other products they produce Ill buy for sure.</li>
    <li> It glides on like butter.  I also like it for my sensitive eyes and it is a cruelty-free product as well. I am a skeptic on cosmetics, but this one was a brand that won me over.</li>
    <li> I have this pencil in Raven and Pearl.  When I first applied it, I was worried about its creamy, smooth texture; I thought it would be smudgey. Not the case!  It&#x27;s wonderful! For daytime, I draw a thin line and soften a bit with my eyeliner brush, for a softer look. At night, I apply and just let it dry to a bolder look, which has the sharpness of a liquid eyeliner. These pencils also sharpen easily and well; I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of the pencil everytime I sharpen it. I love the bit of shimmer, too...not too glittery, just fine enough that it makes you feel a little bit sparkly.  Who doesn&#x27;t like a little sparkle?? :)</li>
    <li> I received a sample in my ipsy bag.  I use it as a highlighter at the corners of my eyes and sometimes under my brow.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It is a bit softer than I like, but I&#x27;m able to work with it.</li>

I also like that the Raven color isn&#x27;t such a dark, matte black color that tends to look really harsh during the day. I normally wear dark brown eyeliner but this Raven color is my go-to now since its more like a charcoal color. Yay!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye Pencil. It goes on so smooth and a pretty color.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this Smooth Shadow in Pearl directly from Elizabeth Mott. I seriously fell in love immediately. The color/shimmer/sparkle is gorgeous and perfect for those days you want to tone it down a little. I came here to buy more when I finally used up my sample.

    <li> The best product on my vanity table. I would recommend this eyeliner to every makeup guru. This is definitely worth it&#x27;s price. Really smooth and noticeable. I love it :)</li>
    <li> About me: Im fair skinned, green eyed and wear contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product: it is a pretty close to my skin color but with some nice shimmer. It glides on with no pulling on my skin and stays for quite a while. I wouldnt consider it long lasting, but it sticks around for a good while. It doesnt create any film on my contacts like some softer eyeliners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: I used this ESPECIALLY on days when i feel or look tired. I put some in the corners of my eyes (inner and outer) and along my waterline for an extra awake look.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this product! When you swatch it on your hand and immediately try to rub it off, this product does not budge. I have watery eyes due to allergies and somewhat sensitive skin. This product does not irritate me and lasts all day. I use this almost daily in the inner corner of my eye to brighten up my look. I love everything that I&#x27;ve tried from this brand, but this is by far my favorite product!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It stays well, and gives good highlights without being too much.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it almost every day on my lower waterline. Totally brightens my eyes and lasts all day and evening long.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love this like I had hoped. Blends poorly and looks like a silvery line below my brows. Returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great color&lt;br /&gt; Goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous. It made my eyes luminescent. However, the product flaked into my under eye and I had to sharpen it every time I used it even though I only used it on my water line.</li>
    <li> I would not describe the color as &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34;.  Maybe &amp;#34;golden pearl&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;yellow pearl&amp;#34;.  I was looking for a product to brighten the waterline.  Something more white would work better for me for that purpose.  It has amazing staying power.  Even in the moisture of my waterline it hung around for about 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it all the time. Got this with my Ipsy bag and loved the color and formula. I got the Pearl Color and It stays on for the whole day. It goes on soo smooth and looks great as a highlighter. Join me on ipsy and subscribe to the Glam Bag! You get 4-5 beauty products every month delivered to your door, for just $10.

    <li> I love these eye pencils!!! They have a great range of colors to choose from. It glides on smoothly and stays on the whole day (even in humid temperatures!) LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love to use this to highlight my inner corners and it stays all day. The formula is creamy and glides effortlessly. No tugging whatsoever! I love the color and the subtle glitter that makes my eyes really pop when I do a smokey eye.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this pencil - it is creamy and you can spread it with your finger.  I use the pearl color for right under the eyebrow as a highlight.  I also bought the raven as a liner for my bottom lid.  It goes on and stays on unlike others I have tried.  But most important, they are cruelty free!</li>
