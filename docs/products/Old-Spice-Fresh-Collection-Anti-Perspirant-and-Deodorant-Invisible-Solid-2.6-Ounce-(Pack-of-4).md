      <li>so this is a great deal on</li>
      <li>Besides that it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Antiperspirant works as advertised and smells great.</li>
      <li>Great smell, and</li>
      <li>It smells good, though.</li>
      <li>Smells good, good price</li>
      <li>My husband loves this smell and brand!It is a good price for the product</li>
      <li>makes them smell so good.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t mind one bit because I LOVE the smell of this deodorant!</li>
      <li>Nice scent that does not compete with my cologne.</li>
      <li>Its nice, its just not what I thought it would be</li>
      <li>Alway keep one handy for those touch up moments.  </li>
      <li>no smell, clean smell and works great.</li>
      <li>My wife, the hotty, really likes it and agrees it smells very attractive without being overpowering like Degree, Dove, or Sure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; scent in any sense, but a more refreshing and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>I frickin&#x27; love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have triend many and love this...</li>
      <li>For many years I another brand</li>
      <li>i love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>And In this day and age I need to stretch the dollar and get the best price; I actually own several types of old spice deodorants / body wash / etc Great product; just watch for the sales...</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s why I ordered some more...</li>
      <li>The antiperspirant side is flawless, during a rehearsal playing a recently taken up trombone, I was sweating more than a jordy in a maths test but all I was getting was the sweet tones of manliness.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like a strong smell so this fresh natural smell it perfect</li>
      <li>Very good product, I simply like that scent.</li>
      <li>only is the scent awesome( also not overpowering or too fruity or flowery!just right!)</li>
      <li>My favorite is still the original scent, but I did like this one as well.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh scent!  </li>
      <li>We got a great deal on these plus an extra coupon.</li>
      <li>Cheap on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>solid deodorants manage my sweat great</li>
      <li>They are all great scented; no complaints from me and it last throughout the day!</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly the deodorant smells great and lasts long, it is my preferred deodorant.</li>
      <li>When you smell that deodorant you know its fiji (if familiar with the body wash)</li>
      <li>Though I am a lady, I sweat like a dude which presents a significant problem when it comes to finding a deodorant that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Lady</li>
      <li>I really love the smell of most of the Old Spice line of deodorants</li>
      <li>gel deodorants which are supposed to be great for lady athletes/sweaty ladies, leave my armpits feeling wet as soon as I start to sweat.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon. :)</li>
      <li>so I really am getting more for my money.</li>
      <li>Since a lot of lady deodorants don&#x27;t do a great job managing sweat when I am really active, I just end up smelling like floral or lady musk</li>
      <li>Love the scent and powerful enough to conquer even the most powerful b.o.</li>
      <li>Old Spice Fresh Collection is an excellent deodorant it was a bit high, And I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it until the price had dropped so place it in your favorites and everytime you open your Amazon page</li>
      <li>For those who wonder what it smells like, I found that I smelled a mix of citrus, herbal, and fresh scents, along with hints of others.</li>
      <li>First time ordering personal items online and was a better deal than purchasing in a store.</li>
      <li>Solid investment since you&#x27;ll always need more deodorant.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you&#x27;re paying for.  </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve never been to Denali yet, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly know if this is what it smells like, but if it does even come close, i might have to visit someday...</li>
      <li>I personally like this scent, and on sale here it was a better deal than the store.</li>
      <li>The stick itself also seems pretty brittle.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell of this deodorant, but I only gave 3 stars because of the misleading title.</li>
      <li>when I saw the double pack for this outstanding price</li>
      <li>The fragrance is unique and not garish like most other men&#x27;s stink sticks.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt smell exactly like the Denali body wash IMO</li>
      <li>Great scent and long lasting!  </li>
      <li>Would recommend, although I prefer Matterhorn and Fiji, still a great scent though, perhaps a little more musk than the other 2 if you&#x27;re into that.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something new and that smells great, i would recommend this and the other new old spice fresh series, depending on your scent preference</li>
      <li>I love this smell and the deodorant itself stays on for a very long time, maybe even a 24hour period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite deodorant for a long time, I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>its nice its just a little off from the Denali scent I am used to</li>
      <li>I also stocked up because where I spend most of my year it is hot &amp; extremely humid &amp; this keeps me drier than the sprays or roll ons that are only available here.</li>
      <li>well the scent no one wants accompanying said sweat!So</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know what else to say.  </li>
      <li>will absolutely buy again.</li>
      <li>but it really protects from sweat and</li>
      <li>This Old Spice is so mild yet masculine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m petite (5&#x27;3&amp;#34;), so when my 6&#x27; tall hubby hugs me, my nose is usually in or near one of his armpits.</li>
      <li>The only gripe i would say i had, was that i found it didn&#x27;t work as well as some other deodorants such as Degree when it came to wetness protection, but it still did work great.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of Old Spice&#x27;s Denali line!</li>
      <li>I have used both the solid and the gel old spice deodorants and the solid work better than</li>
      <li>Since we live in Alaska...</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>it could be any old spice scent and not Denali!</li>
      <li>I really like that my underarms stay dry for the whole day.</li>
      <li>Only thing i&#x27;d knock here is sometime it gets to dry and flakes off when applying, but that is very rare.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Old Spice ever since it was created and have never had an issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so maybe Old Spice should expand their marketing efforts to the ladies.</li>
      <li>when I sweat, it DOES NOT smell like BO and Denali, invisible solid really means invisible,</li>
      <li>With this Old Spice product, never a problem.</li>
      <li>few months ago, I ran out of deodorant and used my significant others&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, however it leaves the underarms on my dark shirts with a white residue (even after washing) that is totally unacceptable.  </li>
      <li>but fresh smell does not last very long at all.</li>
      <li>Plus, it really does keep sweat at bay and keeps him dry.</li>
      <li>Sure beats the heck out of Secret.</li>
      <li>but I am a klutz and have constant issues with so-called &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solids being not so invisible on my clothing when I am not careful enough in the application.&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have with almost all lady deodorants is the smell.</li>

<li> Very strange...</li>
<li> no more streaks on my clothing and the price of this stuff is about the same as the price of my lady deodorant but the men&#x27;s deodorant is larger</li>
<li> Also, wet armpits &#x3D; unattractive sweat spots in the armpits of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;Lady</li>
<li> , my pits never feel wet,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s masculine and subtle.</li>
<li> Hard to find in store came as expected</li>
<li> It seems Old Spice is discontinuing this product.. which is too bad.</li>
<li> I mean...</li>
<li> but seriously this is ridiculous.  </li>
<li> it will tell you if a product has increased in price or decreased in price; I am a thrifty shopper;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used both the solid and the gel old spice deodorants and the solid work better than the gel.&lt;br /&gt;The scent on the denali is the best one</li>
    <li> Its deodorant.  Its works.  I really don&#x27;t know what else to say.  I personally like this scent, and on sale here it was a better deal than the store.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son, who uses this brand of deodorant.  He likes it and it works well for him.  Personal products are a very individual choice, but he likes this one a lot.</li>
    <li> I frickin&#x27; love this stuff. Though I am a lady, I sweat like a dude which presents a significant problem when it comes to finding a deodorant that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Lady gel deodorants which are supposed to be great for lady athletes/sweaty ladies, leave my armpits feeling wet as soon as I start to sweat. Also, wet armpits &#x3D; unattractive sweat spots in the armpits of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;Lady solid deodorants manage my sweat great but I am a klutz and have constant issues with so-called &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solids being not so invisible on my clothing when I am not careful enough in the application.&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have with almost all lady deodorants is the smell. Whomever decided that as a lady, I want to smell like either a field of flowers or an ambiguously fragranced pantyliner should be shot. Since a lot of lady deodorants don&#x27;t do a great job managing sweat when I am really active, I just end up smelling like floral or lady musk BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I ran out of deodorant and used my significant others&#x27;. I really love the smell of most of the Old Spice line of deodorants but Denali is my fave which is the one he happened to have at the time. This stuff works all day, my pits never feel wet, when I sweat, it DOES NOT smell like BO and Denali, invisible solid really means invisible, no more streaks on my clothing and the price of this stuff is about the same as the price of my lady deodorant but the men&#x27;s deodorant is larger so I really am getting more for my money. Also found out that one of my lady neighbors also started using this deodorant a year or so ago so maybe Old Spice should expand their marketing efforts to the ladies. Sure beats the heck out of Secret.</li>
    <li> Actually bought this on sale at CVS almost a month a go,it was great!noT only is the scent awesome( also not overpowering or too fruity or flowery!just right!) but it really protects from sweat and well the scent no one wants accompanying said sweat!So when I saw the double pack for this outstanding price I jumped on it!I paid under $5 on sale at CVS for one last time so this is a great deal on great product!thank you!</li>
    <li> Since we live in Alaska... I mean... why not? He loves the smell, has the matching body wash to go with. I like it on him. It&#x27;s masculine and subtle.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve never been to Denali yet, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly know if this is what it smells like, but if it does even come close, i might have to visit someday... For those who wonder what it smells like, I found that I smelled a mix of citrus, herbal, and fresh scents, along with hints of others. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; scent in any sense, but a more refreshing and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent. My favorite is still the original scent, but I did like this one as well.

If you&#x27;re looking for something new and that smells great, i would recommend this and the other new old spice fresh series, depending on your scent preference</li>
    <li> Very good product, I simply like that scent. Bought that item in Dallas/TX this summer. But only one item...&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I ordered some more...</li>
    <li> This made my hubby very happy, so I can&#x27;t complain! We got a great deal on these plus an extra coupon. Thanks Amazon. :)</li>
    <li> (Using hubby&#x27;s account to write this review.) I&#x27;m petite (5&#x27;3&amp;#34;), so when my 6&#x27; tall hubby hugs me, my nose is usually in or near one of his armpits. But I don&#x27;t mind one bit because I LOVE the smell of this deodorant! And when he holds me before we drift off to sleep at night, he asks, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t you mind having your face in my armpit??&amp;#34; To which I answer, &amp;#34;Nope, it smells good!&amp;#34; Plus, it really does keep sweat at bay and keeps him dry. Bottom line: Guys, get this stuff and help to make the world a happier place.</li>
    <li> Antiperspirant works as advertised and smells great. First time ordering personal items online and was a better deal than purchasing in a store.</li>
    <li> Works and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> The value pack was the way to go with this one.  Way cheaper than Target or Walmart.  Alway keep one handy for those touch up moments.  Only thing i&#x27;d knock here is sometime it gets to dry and flakes off when applying, but that is very rare.  Does not leave AL stains .</li>
    <li> For some reason, the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the deodorant only product (the glycol-based stuff) and it tends to leave deposits on the interior of your shirt. The stick itself also seems pretty brittle. It smells good, though. I think from now on I&#x27;ll be avoiding the antiperspirant and just sticking with the deodorants.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and the deodorant itself stays on for a very long time, maybe even a 24hour period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shower after applying without giving it the proper amount of time it will still be on your armpits, which can be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the deodorant smells great and lasts long, it is my preferred deodorant.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite deodorant for a long time, I really like this stuff. Great smell, and I really like that my underarms stay dry for the whole day.</li>
    <li> 5 stars.  Love the fresh scent!  When you combine it with the shower soap and body spray... WOW!  Try it!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of Old Spice&#x27;s Denali line!</li>
    <li> I love the scent, however it leaves the underarms on my dark shirts with a white residue (even after washing) that is totally unacceptable.  I found that if i put the shirts in the sun it goes away after about 10 minutes but seriously this is ridiculous.  Wish they made this scent in a gel bar.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in store came as expected</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. Denali is his choice while Fiji is mine.</li>
    <li> Nice scent that does not compete with my cologne. Very effective odor protection here in Florida, in the summer!</li>
    <li> Great scent and long lasting!  My new favorite!</li>
    <li> Old Spice Fresh Collection is an excellent deodorant it was a bit high, And I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it until the price had dropped so place it in your favorites and everytime you open your Amazon page it will tell you if a product has increased in price or decreased in price; I am a thrifty shopper; And In this day and age I need to stretch the dollar and get the best price; I actually own several types of old spice deodorants / body wash / etc Great product; just watch for the sales...They are all great scented; no complaints from me and it last throughout the day! A+ Product.</li>
    <li> This Old Spice is so mild yet masculine.  The fragrance is unique and not garish like most other men&#x27;s stink sticks.  My wife, the hotty, really likes it and agrees it smells very attractive without being overpowering like Degree, Dove, or Sure.  It also works well as an antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> The product description is misleading, it says twin pack 5.2 oz, which I thought meant two sticks that are 5.2 oz each, but it&#x27;s actually 5.2 oz total, which is 2 sticks that are 2.5 oz each. Besides that it&#x27;s great and I love the smell of this deodorant, but I only gave 3 stars because of the misleading title.</li>
    <li> For many years I another brand but that brand began to irritate my armpits. With this Old Spice product, never a problem. I also stocked up because where I spend most of my year it is hot &amp; extremely humid &amp; this keeps me drier than the sprays or roll ons that are only available here. Service was very good also.</li>
    <li> *Update*&lt;br /&gt;The SECOND stick broke on me! Very strange... I&#x27;ve been using this Old Spice ever since it was created and have never had an issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The rollers &amp;#34;stripped out&amp;#34; on me... it does not push the product up.  I had to manually push it up with my finger tip, which if you&#x27;ve ever gotten deodorant on your fingers... it does NOT come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  I would suggest you pay the extra 80 cents and buy this at the supermarket.  You will thank you me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this smell and brand!It is a good price for the product and I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Would recommend, although I prefer Matterhorn and Fiji, still a great scent though, perhaps a little more musk than the other 2 if you&#x27;re into that. The antiperspirant side is flawless, during a rehearsal playing a recently taken up trombone, I was sweating more than a jordy in a maths test but all I was getting was the sweet tones of manliness.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;re paying for.  Solid investment since you&#x27;ll always need more deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and powerful enough to conquer even the most powerful b.o.</li>
    <li> already used before...former mitchem user..no smell, clean smell and works great. I have triend many and love this...I don&#x27;t like a strong smell so this fresh natural smell it perfect</li>
    <li> Smells good, good price</li>
    <li> It seems Old Spice is discontinuing this product.. which is too bad. I dig it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell exactly like the Denali body wash IMO it could be any old spice scent and not Denali! Its nice, its just not what I thought it would be it doesnt have that \\&quot;manly\\&quot; smell the body wash does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Fiji for instance.... When you smell that deodorant you know its fiji (if familiar with the body wash) this one not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In end its nice its just a little off from the Denali scent I am used to</li>
    <li> Antiperspirant works well but fresh smell does not last very long at all.</li>
    <li> it was christmas stocking presents for my guys. i love the smell of this. makes them smell so good. will absolutely buy again.</li>
