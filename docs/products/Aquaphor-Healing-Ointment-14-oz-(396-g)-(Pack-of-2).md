      <li>It is also extremely effective on my newborns scratch marks on her face--with this ointment, they practically heal overnight.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>Nice stuff but greasy.</li>
      <li>By far the best stuff for tattoos on the market.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so it can be incredibly unbearable.</li>
      <li>This is important if your child is in daycare and may play with toys that have irritants on them!</li>
      <li>Using the Aquaphor did not hurt at all, and healed them immediately! :-)</li>
      <li>We have tried every cream and lotion including several prescription and the best I have found are Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and Eucerin</li>
      <li>Aquaphor is better than any ointment I&#x27;ve tried for burns.</li>
      <li>This product works better than anything else we have tried.  </li>
      <li>Such a wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>He is now 8 months and doing better and kept his eczema under control.  </li>
      <li>Arrived in a timely fashion, appropriately packaged, as advertised.  </li>
      <li>So we have been using it mostly in the Winter, and use Cetaphil in the summer.</li>
      <li>Worked like magic.</li>
      <li>I also like that this can be used for more than just diaper rash, unlike most products I was looking at.</li>
      <li>It is more like petroleum jelly and will soothe and heal any cracks or blisters (on the lips)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Aquaphor is 8x more at a whopping $16.</li>
      <li>why, but for his rashes I found Triple Paste to provide the most relief for him.  </li>
      <li>I read recommendations for Aquaphor, and more specifically this healing ointment, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
      <li>For baby&#x27;s eczema, turns out Eucerin Cream worked better.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff (along w/Dr.</li>
      <li>Most soothing and safe products for her irritable skin.</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is pretty good.</li>
      <li>and it is perfect for his dry face skin!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product for very, very dry skin.</li>
      <li>... for my 5 month old&#x27;s eczema and along with a prescription it works great.  </li>
      <li>Also, I recommended this to my best friend, who&#x27;s toddler had a severe rash she couldn&#x27;t get rid due to middle-of-the-night BM&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
      <li>Have been using this as per doctor&#x27;s recommendation on my daughter (2 months) who tends to get diaper rash easily.    </li>
      <li>ITS AN ECONOMICAL, AS WELL AS  CONVENIENT, METHOD OF DELIVERY- IM PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS OPTION-</li>
      <li>The Aquaphor does not go on as easily as the Balmex and also does not absorb as well.</li>
      <li>We put this on and it is fine.  </li>
      <li>Using most anti-infection medications cause quick color fading, so you don&#x27;t want</li>
      <li>I enjoy using the Aquaphor Healing Ointment for moisturizing my skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;With babies and toddlers, and for that matter adults with any skin issues, Aquaphor is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This is a GREAT deal compare to local stores.</li>
      <li>Whenever that happens, I slap on some Aquaphor or Eucerin Original Cream</li>
      <li>Works great for diaper rash and minor cuts; almost like overnite healing.  </li>
      <li>Great on dry elbows, too.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Works super fast and is easy and safe to use.  </li>
      <li>Great product for babies with dry skin!  </li>
      <li>Only concern is the HIGH price, would buy again, but at a lower price would sure be nice!</li>
      <li>However, this takes a long time, and, when my 2 week old son (who was born with a perfect complexion) broke out all over his face, I did not want to wait weeks before it cleared up on</li>
      <li>I really wish I would have taken before and after pictures to show how much better she looked with each passing day.</li>
      <li>It works better than Triple Antibiotic ointment or Neosporin, which is very sticky and rubbed off or stuck to my pillow when sleeping.  </li>
      <li>It is super greasy but provides great protection to very dry skin.</li>
      <li>, so it&#x27;s best to test it out on a small patch of skin first.</li>
      <li>and my wife actually tried it for a diaper rash and had great feedback that it cleared up really fast and did not rub off.  </li>
      <li>I tried Aquaphor and what a great difference, kept his skin clear of rash and soft..</li>
      <li>I tried many different products for diaper rash and many of them worked</li>
      <li>We have used it for a year and it has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>After two days of using Aquaphor, her skin is now almost completely healed and her beautiful complexion is back!</li>
      <li>That was enough convincing for me!</li>
      <li>really helps dry skin, great on feet</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.:-);-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not like this, as it feels just like vaseline. I have not used it. Too greasy for me.</li>
    <li> I have skin that has always been at risk of Sunburn and Skin Cancer.&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a Seven week treatment with Radiation of a Skin Cancer on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;The Cancer Center where my oncology radiology Doctor works used a Varian Trilogy medical particle accelerator.&lt;br /&gt;About a 4 inch diameter area of my neck skin beneath my left ear was treated with Radiation Five days a week for seven weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It soon became warm to the touch, red and irritated, dried out and cracking in the center with skin flaking off around the perimeter.&lt;br /&gt;It was similar feeling to a really bad SUNBURN that kept getting too much sun daily, except on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;I found a 2 once tube of a clear gel called \\&quot;AfterBurn\\&quot; for \\&quot;Serious Burn Treatment\\&quot; and applied a thick layer of it two or three times a day for instant soothing relief of pain.  See at www.AfterBurnRelief.com.&lt;br /&gt;Before this I was applying Comfrey-St. John&#x27;s Wort Compound from www.MountainRoseHerbs.com in the early days.&lt;br /&gt;And my doctor recommended \\&quot;Colonial Dames Vitamin E Cream\\&quot;, enriched with Aloe Vera, which was very helpful in healing red blotches on my face, but stung where ever my skin was cracked after two or three weeks of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;When I told my doctor I had some minor skin irritation and pain, she gave me a few small sample tubes and a $1.00 off coupon for&lt;br /&gt;AQUAPHOR HEALING OINTMENT, from Eucerin.  It is true as its claim to be an \\&quot;Advance Therepy for Dry, Cracked, or irritated skin.  A skin protectant.\\&quot;  It works better than Triple Antibiotic ointment or Neosporin, which is very sticky and rubbed off or stuck to my pillow when sleeping.  I was warned to NOT use taped on pads or large bandaids.  I kept hydrating with lots of Sports drinks with electrolyte and Water and always applied a coating of AQUAPHOR after each treatment with radiation.  It has helped, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and both my sister and my doctor recommended we use a Eucerin product (like Aquaphor).  We noticed results the same day! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We now use Eucerin for all our little blemishes or skin irritations. &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Baby\\&quot; Aquaphor appears to be basically the same are the regular Aquaphor.  Both work well.</li>
    <li> Have been using this as per doctor&#x27;s recommendation on my daughter (2 months) who tends to get diaper rash easily.    This is pretty effective, tried triple paste, and other standard rash creams, but they are not very effective.    Some people say this is just same as vaseline, which is not true, the active ingredient is same but in vaseline it is 100% while in this it is 40%, for a diaper rash cream the skin should still be able to breathe (pores not clogged)    My daughter also has eczema and the doctor recommended using this for that also, and it is very effective on that too.    The price on Amazon is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor by Eucerin is an excellent product to prevent diaper rash.  It doesn&#x27;t allow the skin to absorb and it protects your babies skin, when applied consistently during every diaper change. It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this ointment.  Works great for diaper rash and minor cuts; almost like overnite healing.  Works super fast and is easy and safe to use.  Love this stuff (along w/Dr. Smith&#x27;s)!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the product. You will not get this product any cheaper anywhere. Since it is a product I need to use for my kid on a daily basis, I will buy only from Amazon as long as they sell it.    Regarding the product, it is highly recommended for excessive dry skin and eczema in kids. It locks the moisture in for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is an awesome product.  I use it as cream to protect my son from diaper rash (put a layer on his bum before he goes to sleep for the night and never had a rash) and for myself whenever I have chap lips or rough/dry spots on my hands and feet.  Works wonders.  I&#x27;ve bought two containers from Amazon and I&#x27;m still not done using them.  I&#x27;m only down to 3/4 of the way on the first container.  Hint-Use a Q-tip since a little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t want to contaminate the rest of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my daughter since she was about 2 months old. She has very sensitive skin and this was the 1st product that I found that moisturizes her skin without irratating it. After doing an extensive search I found that Amazon sells it for the cheapest price so we continue to buy it from here. We send one container to daycare and the other one stays at the house.</li>
    <li> My TATTOO artist recommended this stuff to aid healing of a large tattoo.  Tattoos are wounds of millions of pinprick penetrations that open your skin to bacteria.  As the tiny wounds heal, they scab up, dry out and itch.  Removing the scabs cause all sorts of bacterial problems including infections.  Using most anti-infection medications cause quick color fading, so you don&#x27;t want those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I started using this product, I noticed an immediate change in my hands.  My old, beat up, wrinkled skin softened and smoothed out.  My hands feel better than I ever remember!  And of course it worked on the tattoos, no scabbing or itching at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this stuff for all sorts of skin irritations from now on... a great discovery for me!</li>
    <li> I love Aquaphor!! It works very well. My hands were really chapped, and lotion stung to put on them. Using the Aquaphor did not hurt at all, and healed them immediately! :-) I highly recommend this product.:-);-)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so it can be incredibly unbearable. Whenever that happens, I slap on some Aquaphor or Eucerin Original Cream and they soothe the skin. It also works for the face for a temporary amount of time (eventually, it clogs up the pores if you use it too much). I tried California Baby, but their lotion makes my skin dry. Also, Cetaphil lotion is too mild and makes my skin turn red.     Sadly, though, some people are allergic to the ingredients (like my old manager), so it&#x27;s best to test it out on a small patch of skin first.</li>
    <li> All the doctors these days say not to put anything on baby acne, and it will heal on it&#x27;s own. However, this takes a long time, and, when my 2 week old son (who was born with a perfect complexion) broke out all over his face, I did not want to wait weeks before it cleared up on it&#x27;s own. My grandmother and aunts suggested trying this ointment. I washed his face once a day with plain water, and then put Aquaphor over the red bumps. It&#x27;s been 3 days since I&#x27;ve started doing this everyday, and his acne is almost gone! It&#x27;s amazing, because his face was completely covered and I figured it would take at least a week to clear up. I&#x27;m sure by tomorrow or the next day his face will be back to normal, thanks to this stuff!</li>
    <li> I had some moles removed by a plastic surgeon.  At first I couldn&#x27;t find this product which he recomended and used triple antibiotic ointment on the areas.  2 weeks and limited healing.  Finally found it and overnight turnaround on my wounds.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to this ointment!  Our son has eczema and it works wonders!  We use it morning and night.  At night, he can have large, red patches and by morning, they are GONE.  Also, he doesn&#x27;t get diaper rash often but when he does, the typical creams make him scream.  We put this on and it is fine.  I&#x27;ve never seen a product work this good!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my new baby. and it is perfect for his dry face skin!</li>
    <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment worked well for me.  I saw results within a weeks time.  It actually does what it says.  It protects the skin from moisture as it heals.</li>
    <li> While my husband was undergoing radiation treatment for cancer, Dr. recommended Aquaphor for his sunborn-like skin.  Worked great!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for very, very dry skin. We have used it for a year and it has helped tremendously.</li>
    <li> I am someone who has taken Accutane, and because of the medication I now have pretty dry skin.  The skin can crack and slough off, and it can be pretty painful.  I read recommendations for Aquaphor, and more specifically this healing ointment, so I decided to give it a shot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ointment is a sticky, greasy, tar-like substance.  I grimaced as I rubbed the goo onto my dry skin, where it stayed for the next 10 hours.  My clothing and my bed linens all have residue on them from this ointment.  I had tried vaseline (the substance, not the brand) months before this, but disliked it because it was...   sticky, greasy, and tar-like.  However, the vaseline did help my skin.  This is the exact same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you can put up with the heavy feeling of it on your skin for hours, as well as how it soils your clothes, then I would recommend regular old generic vaseline.  It&#x27;s the exact same, except it probably won&#x27;t come in as colorful a bottle.</li>
    <li> When I found out that my baby has eczema, has peanut allergy, and is prone to breakout in itchy rash often, I tried A LOT of creams and nothing worked. His skin just soaked up the lotions and he was still dry. So I went online and did a lot of research and found Aquaphor. Along with the Vanicream recommended by his allergist (you can get it over the counter, just have to ask the pharmacist), I used the Aquaphor to seal the Vanicream on specific areas of his breakouts. It has been two months now and his skin now looks GREAT. He is not waking up at nights from his itchy skin! I still use it for him everyday and whenever I see/feel little bumps, I just put on the Vanicream and seal it with Aquaphor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for his clothes and sheets, there are no stains from the Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aquaphor on both of my children&#x27;s skin for the last 3 1/2 years and have found nothing that compares. My 19 month old has eczema which is under control ONLY when Aquaphor is used daily. We use it for chapped lips, skin, diaper rash...the list goes on.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is no better than a .99 cent jar of vaseline and it&#x27;s just as greasy.  My son has severe eczema  and dry skin all over his body.  We have tried every cream and lotion including several prescription and the best I have found are Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and Eucerin (Wal-Mart sells a generic version that works just as well).  There is  no benefit to buying this over petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> I started using Aquaphor since my baby was born. It&#x27;s great for diaper rashes and to keep your baby&#x27;s skin moisturized. My son has very dry skin and this cream is great for cracked cheeks too. I hightly recommend it. It&#x27;s very convenient if you order it through the subscription program from Amazon. You save in shipping plus a discount.</li>
    <li> After having read all the reviews, I had high hopes for Aquaphor for baby&#x27;s eczema. It turned out to be a gooey, sticky mess that rubbed off on everything and was hard to remove: me, bedsheets, clothes, toys... I agree with the previous reviewer: isn&#x27;t 100% petrolatum (aka, Vaseline) better than Aquaphor&#x27;s 41% petrolatum? Also generic petroleum jelly is $2. Aquaphor is 8x more at a whopping $16. I do use the remaining Aquaphor for baby&#x27;s diaper area, and it seems to be working as well as petroleum jelly. For baby&#x27;s eczema, turns out Eucerin Cream worked better. If you&#x27;re dealing with eczema, perhaps you can try Eucerin Cream to moisturize and then lock it in (like another reviewer wrote) with Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I first came across Aquaphor when my husbands derm. told him to use it for his \\&quot;confused\\&quot; skin. It has been a life saver for him. I started using it as well for my lips, acne scars, dry spots, little cuts. It&#x27;s great. Then when we had our daughter guess what they told us to use when she cut her face with her nails...aquaphor. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. It&#x27;s expensive but again, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Repeat order for my mother who suffers from skin disorder. Most soothing and safe products for her irritable skin. She goes for skin laser at National Skin centre to treat her skin disease thrice weekly. Her skin flaking and looks terrible, so far this is the only cream which is most suitable for her. She uses on her lips, head, hands and legs, in fact whole body. This is not available in SINGAPORE, so I have to order online for her regularly.</li>
    <li> They should call aquaphor. Vasoline for Dummies. Please don&#x27;t allow yourself to be ripped off. Nothing but over priced petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to us by our birth educator citing it is easiest to wipe off of newborns delicate skin, compared to A&amp;D, Desitin or Butt Paste.  We bought it and my daughter has never had a bad diaper rash.  The first sign of redness, I apply this to her clean dry bottom and the redness is gone within 12 hours.  Also, I recommended this to my best friend, who&#x27;s toddler had a severe rash she couldn&#x27;t get rid due to middle-of-the-night BM&#x27;s.  She said within two days, the severe rash was completely healed.  Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  6 YEARS LATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son did not respond to Aquaphor as well as my daughter did.  I have no idea why, but for his rashes I found Triple Paste to provide the most relief for him.  However, I would STILL recommend Aquaphor as your FIRST purchase.  Really works well for a variety of conditions.  Chapped lips, chafing and diaper rash.  Some people even recommend for dry skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a bad diaper rash and the dermatologist recommended this ointment.  It works great!!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> The moment the temperature outside falls below 50 degrees, my hands and legs almost immediately get so dry they crack and start bleeding. I apply Aquafor and my skin heals literally overnight without multiple applications.  True, Aquafor is a bit more expensive than its more well known competitors but after trying all those other lotions for extra dry skin, none of them even come close.  The 2 tub pack is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is something that was recommended to me by my Dermatologist.     I use it on everything from dry elbows to my lips. It is more like petroleum jelly and will soothe and heal any cracks or blisters (on the lips)</li>
    <li> I put this on my newborn if she&#x27;s looking a little red, and it goes away within a few changes. Keeps her from fussing, and actually makes wiping the next poop easier!  I also like that this can be used for more than just diaper rash, unlike most products I was looking at. Also, I use a diaper service and the owner said he used this on his own kids and loved it. That was enough convincing for me!</li>
    <li> ... for my 5 month old&#x27;s eczema and along with a prescription it works great.  This is a GREAT deal compare to local stores.</li>
    <li> I spent the first year of my son&#x27;s life trying everything under the sun to heal his dry skin.  I did the Aveeno&#x27;s, Eucerin, Lubriderm, regular Vaseline, etc.  Nothing works as well as Aquaphor.  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time and money on all that other stuff.  I suppose I was preoccupied by the price since this stuff is a little spendy, but in the long run it is totally worth it.  Yes, it is kinda&#x27; goopy like Vaseline.  I put it on my son after his bath just before bed so it soaks in all night while he wears his sleeper.  Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> My baby was 4 months when his eczema started, searched for a good moisturizer...eucerin, an excellent moisturizer but did not alleviate my baby&#x27;s itching. I tried Aquaphor and what a great difference, kept his skin clear of rash and soft..what a great blessing.  He is now 8 months and doing better and kept his eczema under control.  My baby is much happier now.  I highly recommend this product to anybody with severe eczema.</li>
    <li> I tried many different products for diaper rash and many of them worked ok but my daughter ended up with a severe diaper rash beacause of some medication she was taking. Her pediatrician recommended I get Baby Aquaphor. This product is just amazing! Ever since we started using it, she has not even had a hint of a diaper rash. Also she use to have dry skin around the top of the diaper and she would scratch. That has also been gone since we started using this product. I can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
    <li> Nice stuff but greasy. Think Vaseline but medicated.</li>
    <li> Great product for babies with dry skin!  Doctor recommended it to me, and hydrates the skin! But is gentle enough without irratating the skin.</li>
    <li> Baby has ezcema and this keeps her skin soft all day long! It stays on longer than vasoline and doesn&#x27;t disappear like lotion. This is important if your child is in daycare and may play with toys that have irritants on them! It&#x27;s also good for diaper rash as it creates a protective barrier and lastly, mommie&#x27;s dry hands! If you&#x27;re changing alot of diapers and washing your hands alot this will keep your skin from drying out!</li>
    <li> Best diaper ointment period. I am a mother of two little ones, and there is nothing like Aquaphor! It works, and it&#x27;s easy to apply and wipe off at diaper changes (with zinc oxide based creams you really have to wipe hard sometimes). Don&#x27;t buy the small size or tube, just buy the big size and you can put some in a small travel sized container to take with you or in the diaper bag. I find it&#x27;s also for grown-ups -- softens rough spots on heels and elbows.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000HGUAW0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 oz (396 g) (Pack of 2)]]  I placed an order and received Auaphor Baby Ointment. I was told not to return it. I requested a reorder and Baby ointment was delivered again.Again I was told oinments can not be returned. I requested a credit. I then received an Email stating I would not receive a credit unless the itm was returned. I am still waiting for a credit. I have been an Amazon customer for 10 years and this has been my worst experiece.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended that I get Aquaphor for the dry skin on my legs.  I ordered it through Amazon because it was less expensive.  This product is absolutely wonderful.  I had a very dry patch on my leg and after only two applications, it started coming off.  I no longer have that dry patch.  Also, my chest was feeling dry, even though I mosturize with my face mosturizer.  I started using Aquaphor on it and it is much smoother.  I told my daughter to get some because she was born with dry skin and has always suffered because of it, to the point of her legs bleeding.  She has started using it and feels the same as I do!</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is the best product I have ever used for tattoo healing. Using aquaphor, my tattoos heal super-quick with almost ZERO scabbing. Cuts healing times in-half. By far the best stuff for tattoos on the market.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000HGUAW0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 oz (396 g) (Pack of 2)]]  I HAVE THIS SENT TO MY 5 YR OLD GRANDSON ON AUTODELIVERY AS HE HAS SUCH A BAD CASE OF ECZEMA- THIS HAS BEEN PART OF HIS TOPICAL ROUTINE FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE. HE HAS TO HAVE IT AND ITS AN ECONOMICAL, AS WELL AS  CONVENIENT, METHOD OF DELIVERY- IM PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS OPTION-</li>
    <li> My daughter is 4 and has severe eczema and have been using the product since she was one. It does not irritate the skin at all. But it does feel oily. So we have been using it mostly in the Winter, and use Cetaphil in the summer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Aquaphor! I have eczema, so it is really hard to find something that won&#x27;t irritate my skin or make it even dryer than it already is. Aqhaphor has been a lifesaver for me! I put it on every day, and it actually soaks into my skin. Other products just sit on top of it. I let my friends try it. Now they are buying it, too!</li>
    <li> I use this ointment on my toddler daughter&#x27;s extremely sensitive skin.  It contains no perfumes or dyes that can irritate the skin.  It is also extremely effective on my newborns scratch marks on her face--with this ointment, they practically heal overnight.  A little goes a LONG way--a large tub like the one above will last forever. Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
    <li> My son has sensitive skin and can get bad diaper rashes.  I read somewhere about a children&#x27;s hospital that mixes Aquaphor with Maalox - they call it \\&quot;Aqualox\\&quot; - for diaper rash.  It is a miracle cream...so much better than any other balms I&#x27;ve bought.  To make it, do equal parts of Aquaphor &amp; Maalox.  Stir (for a while...arm will get tired) until the mix has a smooth consistency.      We use the subscription service to be well-stocked with Aquaphor.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> this product is fabulous- my newborn was suffering from eczema and his pediatrician recommended we use this ointment, since all other creams werent helping....this worked wonders- now i have 2 tubs of this ointment on automatic monthly delivery-one for upstairs and one for downstairs..</li>
    <li> My son has had eczema practically since birth.  We usually use Balmex Extra Protective Clear Ointment which contains 51% white petrolatum.  We decided to try Aquaphor due its similarity in active ingredients and because of the great Amazon price (we bought the 2 pack).  It definitely does the job, but we still prefer the Balmex Clear.  The Aquaphor does not go on as easily as the Balmex and also does not absorb as well.</li>
    <li> Really good for baby to prevent diaper rash and pimples in the diaper area. Doesn&#x27;t keep diaper rash at bay100%though</li>
    <li> This is recommended by my Dr....and my wife actually tried it for a diaper rash and had great feedback that it cleared up really fast and did not rub off.  Only concern is the HIGH price, would buy again, but at a lower price would sure be nice!</li>
    <li> i use it on my baby, head to toe. She never had diaper rash or dry skin problem. recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry skin.  Been using it on my baby, no harmful hormones that were found in regular lotions.</li>
    <li> I used this product for everything while on Accutane.  I used it on my extremely dry lips, I used it on my face when the medication started making my skin peel and nothing else helped, this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me to buy this for healing stitches, worked wonderful. Kept the stitches from being dried out and itchy.</li>
    <li> Clears up any diaper rash or bump within a day and can be used for scrapes, dry skin or chapped lips. Great on dry elbows, too. I&#x27;ve used it for years for myself and now for my baby.  Stock up on the 3-pack - it&#x27;s a great value!</li>
    <li> My son had terrible eczema, and his pediatrician recommended this! Worked like magic. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> We tried a few different creams, Vaseline, lanolin and a steroid ointment prescribed by our pediatrician to relieve our 4 month old&#x27;s eczema. She was still miserable and I was itchy just looking at her :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dr sent the nurse in to hand off the second (and stronger) type of steroid ointment we were going to try and the nurse asked if we had tried Aquafor. When I said no, she went to grab a few samples for me. Yes, it is sticky and oily and got all over my clothes and is expensive but it worked so amazingly that we never even used the steroid cream and we were at a place where we would have done almost anything to relieve her discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might not work for everyone, but it was the only thing that worked for our little one. I really wish I would have taken before and after pictures to show how much better she looked with each passing day.</li>
    <li> Not too greasy. Great moisture and protection for post-laser and post-peel treated skin. Also works excellent on sun burnt skin and healing wounds.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the Aquaphor Healing Ointment for moisturizing my skin.  I will get the rough skin off my feet and then I&#x27;ll take my footie socks and turn the socks wrong side out and apply the Aquaphor to the bottom and up the sides of the socks.  Then I&#x27;ll turn the socks back right side out and put them on my feet and wear them.  My feet are really soft now.  LOL  It work!  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> As an RN, I was told that this ointment is used in NICU&#x27;s across the nation on premature babies.  Aquaphor protects the delicate skin of neonates from sloughing off and protects from all kinds of problems like fluid loss and possible pathogens initiated through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With babies and toddlers, and for that matter adults with any skin issues, Aquaphor is fantastic.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t discover this ointment until a few months ago with the arrival of my third child.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate... I keep a jar on every level of the house with the diapers and wipes.  Of course I also keep a little tube in my diaper bag.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
    <li> My son is 11 months old.  We slather his little bum in Aquaphor every night before bed.  The few times he&#x27;s had a diaper rash, one round of Aquaphor on it has cleared it up.  Compared to what happened the one time we applied a zinc oxide type cream, which just turned the rash redder and uglier until we relented, applied Aquaphor and the rash disappeared in a few hours.  A single tub this size has lasted us 11 months.    Aquaphor is not vaseline.  It has several other ingredients which make it more smooth textured.  It is expensive, I agree, but honestly worth it, given it has a myriad of uses and such a small amount goes such a long way.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Aquaphor in a hospital where I was in for treatment for psoriasis. It&#x27;s better then ANY OTHER creams or lotions. It looks greasy, but if you apply it, and give it a moment, it will absorb into your skin and keep it moist all day. No more cracked skin around the fingers during the winter months.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, appropriately packaged, as advertised.  I was very pleased that it came in a jar which is easier to use than a pump.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is better than any ointment I&#x27;ve tried for burns.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT SEE ANY CHANGE IN MY SKIN AND I&#x27;M USING IT ALL THE TIME MAYBE IT&#x27;S NOT FOR ME OR MAYBE IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE REGULAR VASELINE.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my babies&#x27; delicate skin.  I mix it in my hand with a little lotion to help it rub on easier.</li>
    <li> I give out Aquaphor or Baby Aquaphor (same exact product) to my customers to heal their new tattoos.  This product works better than anything else we have tried.  The healing process is dramatically shorter.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful product!  Aquaphor has come to the rescue for me in so many different occasions!    My toddler has eczema and after going through tons of prescription creams and ointments, my friend told me about Aquaphor.  I used it on her several times during the day and the severe eczema dried up within 48 hours!  I was so excited to finally find an end to my child&#x27;s misery.  Now my daughter asks me to put her \\&quot;special lotion\\&quot; on every day just so that she can prevent it from coming back.    I fell further in love with the product when my newborn&#x27;s face broke out with \\&quot;hormone pimples\\&quot;.  The pediatrician told me it was normal and that her face would clear up in 3-4 months.  I was saddened to see my baby&#x27;s face look like that of a teenager, so I tried the Aquaphor again.  The Aquaphor began clearing my baby&#x27;s face almost immediately.  Within a few hours, the \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; looked like they were drying up, and three days later my baby&#x27;s face was as smooth as her bottom!      I&#x27;ve also used it on my own chapped skin, including those times where I&#x27;ve rubbed my nose raw from too much sneezing.  It healed my chapped skin beautifully.  I&#x27;ve given a sample tube to my cousin who has severe road rash burns on her entire body from an accident and she says she sees it helping her healing process come along much quicker.  It&#x27;s even helped ease the pain for my uncle whos skin is peeling due to cancer treatments.    Since I&#x27;ve procured little sample bottles here and there and have purchased several tubes, I keep Aquaphor on me at all times.  I&#x27;ve given away a bunch of my tubes!  When a fellow mom tells me of their child&#x27;s diaper woes, rashes or eczema, I take out my Aquaphor and give it to them.  I&#x27;ve received tons of Thank Yous from others and they now carry Aquaphor everywhere too!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my doctors assistant.  It is super greasy but provides great protection to very dry skin. I prefer&lt;br /&gt;the Eucerin intensive repair when the dry skin is not as serious.  I think the Aquaphor would work great for babies with diaper&lt;br /&gt;issues.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor does the job without the heaviness of petroleum jelly or the sticky mess of other diaper area creams.  Mothers prefer this product, and grandma thinks it works well, too.</li>
    <li> As Advertised.  Really helps with dry skin on your feet!</li>
    <li> A miracle for my extremely dry feet. Not greasy but lubricating.</li>
    <li> really helps dry skin, great on feet</li>
    <li> This is the first review I ever wrote because I was just so impressed with this product. My 7 week old daughter first developed what my doctor called \\&quot;baby acne\\&quot;, which turned into horrible dry peeling skin all over her face and ears and scalp. The doctor then said it was Seborrhea dermatitis (cradle cap) and to use a dandruff shampoo on her scalp and baby oil on her face, which did nothing. After two days of using Aquaphor, her skin is now almost completely healed and her beautiful complexion is back! This product really is amazing!!!</li>
