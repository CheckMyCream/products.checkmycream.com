<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these brushes, but they do shed a few strands.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and high quality brushes and case. Thanks for the bonus brush.</li>
    <li> LOVE this set! I happened across it and it had everything I was looking for in a brush set. The flat top kabuki is the perfect brush for a flawless foundation application. All brushes are soft and perfect for any application needs! Shipping was fast and hassle free! This is a great product for a fantastic value! I highly recommend purchasing this brush set--you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received an email from the co-founder/owner of Keshima asking if I would submit a review of the Kabuki brushes I had ordered.She must have had confidence that I was satisfied with my order. And she was right! I have been trying all kinds of methods to get my makeup just right. I decided to try the Kabuki brushes. I was thrilled to discover upon opening the box that not only were the brushes individually wrapped in plastic with I might add a very nice case, but were labelled as well. Since I have to be at work very early and since I am of a \\&quot;certain age\\&quot; it helps me to know that I am using the right brush.And girls it didn&#x27;t take me too long before I didn&#x27;t have to look for the label!!The brushes are just so soft and dense and like others have said they just pick up enough powder to do the job. With proper care i:e washing and drying, I hope to use them for a long time. But then again, I love them so much, and they are affordable, that if and when they do wear out I&#x27;ll just buy them again.</li>
    <li> All the brushes are amazing and I must say so is this company. Your customer service has gone above and beyond. I will highly recommend your brushes to everyone I know. Thank you again for the awesome experience!!!</li>
    <li> These Brushes were so soft! I absolutely loved them, great buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great set - soft bristles and well-made.  Loved that it came with the case and the BONUS kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush set! It really is the perfect set of makeup brushes. I use every single one and I am very pleased with them all. I definitely recommend these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Great seller.  Washed the brushes and not one hair fell out!  The angled brush is fabulous for blush and/or bronzer.  I loove the flat top kabuki brush puts your makeup on with no excess anywhere,  Blend foundation or BB cream in for a flawless finish.  This was the first brush set that I&#x27;ve purchased in many years so I researched and read lots of reviews-these are a winner.  I&#x27;m going to purchase another kabuki brush and the dual end eyebrow brush lots very interesting, but they were out when I purchased the set so will buy that one at the same time.  Really like the added brush protectors on a couple of the brushes, would like to have seen the kabuki as a retractable or at the very least, some kind of protection.  Haven&#x27;t used them long enough to know how they hold up, but they do have a nice guarantee which is a huge plus!!   May 11th update! I am not quite sure which brush does what, but the small flatter white one is superb for applying eyeshadow on the entire lid and the large angled white brush was wonderful for blush.  The flat kabuki was a disappointment at first but it seems pretty good for BB cream and would probably work well for burnishing in foundation.  I was never able to download the Ebook.  I emailed the company, but have not received a response.</li>
    <li> When this package was delivered and I opened it, I expected to find a lower quality product due to the lower price in comparison to most professional, well known brands. But this product exceeded my expectations by far! The packaging is beautiful, and includes 5 brushes - one for every part of your face and makeup routine and a case to carry it all in. I was impressed that the case it comes in is sturdy, high quality and even has snaps to hold it together. This set is perfect for travel when you don&#x27;t want to carry a lot or don&#x27;t have a lot of room. Pack this set and your travel makeup bag and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to get to the brushes themselves. They&#x27;re great quality too! Soft enough that they feel nice on your skin and blend makeup beautifully, but hard enough that they won&#x27;t snap and break. The classic black, silver and white color scheme enhances the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes have been compared to the expensive and widely known and popular Sigma Beauty brushes, without the heft price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for makeup brushes ( and if you&#x27;re a makeup fan, when are you not ? ), these are a great option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. My opinions stated above are my own, but may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Love these soft bristle brushes.  And I love the fact that it comes with a case to hold them in, so to me this is very convenient.  These brushes blend in your makeup very nicely with leaving a smooth finish.  Each brush serves its own purpose.  I like to use the flat top brush for my foundation and another one for my blush.  There is also one for blending and eyeliner.  This is a must have for your makeup collection.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft, and apply my make evenly my favorite is the kabuki brush!</li>
    <li> Only giving the 4 stars because I have yet to use all the brushes. BUT, I do love the kabuki brush. I have used it every day for my foundation and it has yet to drop a single hair! It cleans up beautifully, time and again. I have used it with Estee Lauder dbl wear and the max coverage, flawless.&lt;br /&gt;*update&lt;br /&gt;All the brushes are amazing, the kabuki is still awesome. Have yet to drop any hair after several months of everyday use.</li>
    <li> They are great brushes ! Love them.</li>
    <li> just received the kit. will try it and get back to you, let you know how I liked the brushed</li>
    <li> oh my word, these are fantastic. I have used makeup brushes for at least the last 20 years and these, by far, are my favorite. they glide across your face. they are so soft and smooth. the bristles are of great quality so you don&#x27;t have to pick them off your face. they are very easy to work with. I love that all the brushes you need comes in one kit. I will not EVER be buying brushes from any other company. I have already purchased 2 more of these. one for each of my girls. they love them as well. the video that comes with it is perfect for women wanting to know some new tricks, as well as for teenage young ladies to learn how to wear makeup and look classy. I think every woman should own this set of brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes come sealed in plastic, within a sturdy, nicely finished holder with sort of a smooth leatherette feel.  The set of brushes is just as described -- but this review is only to add that in person, the case and brushes are in fact first rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your wife or daughters will be very pleased. And you&#x27;ll look like you know something about cosmetics (not a specialty for most Dads, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars rather than five only because this is not some super, super premium product that exceeds perfect.  it&#x27;s a tremendous value and very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value, great for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Three days later daughter informs Mom and Dad that \\&quot;what Dad found was better than the other brushes she and Mom found.... \\&quot; THANKS, she says.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! Beautiful set in a hard case! I travel a lot, so these were perfect! The brushes are nicely made!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> These are very nice brushes. Your first impression should not be based on the box that it comes in. Once you open the box you will find that the brushes are in a nice faux leather container. The brushes themselves are super also. I have only had them for a little over a week, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> After taking my wife &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34; hints about she needing a new makeup brushes set, I decided to buy this set as a Christmas gift. She loved it after washing and drying the brushes she used them right away. She specially liked the blush and blending brushes and how each of the brushes have the name on it. Also the case is pretty sturdy (we were both impressed by that). All in all, these seem to be a pretty good set and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice quality, however I am having the issue with the powder brush of the bristles coming off on my face. This is super annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received a new powder brush today and the quality of the brush is excellent. I would definitely recommend buying this set</li>
    <li> I did not get the whole set but would love to. I received the flat top kabuki brush. it is so soft and so far I just love how it applied my makeup, Looks very nice. So far I have not noticed it loosing hair. Will keep you updated on if notice loosing hair. That was one reason I wanted a new makeup brush, my old one would loose lots hairs and I would spend to much time getting them off.</li>
    <li> love this product , very good quality  .&lt;br /&gt; I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the variety included in this set. The only one that seems to have shedding issues it the black powder brush. I think my favorites are the Mac 217 dupe and the kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone as a starter or addition set.</li>
    <li> All the brushes you need. I love the material, they are really soft!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  I&#x27;m relatively new to applying make up but I knew I needed the right tools to get the right look.  I had previously used the cheaper brushes that were included with the product.  Well I decided it was time to upgrade my brushes and I am so happy I did.  These brushes are soft and really apply and blend the makeup well.  The packaging is quality.</li>
    <li> This Keshima makeup brush set contains all the basic sizes and shapes for cosmetic application: a fat, soft one for powder; a slightly thinner angled one for blush; two much smaller ones for eyeshadow and blending; and a thin, precise one for eyeliner.  It comes in a case that detaches in the middle and snaps together on the sides.  You can then leave the brushes exposed on your vanity counter or pack them up for travel or storage.  With five brushes, it isn&#x27;t a deluxe set, but it does have everything I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the brushes hold their hairs.  Nothing is worse than picking bristles off my face after I&#x27;ve applied makeup.  I also like that, except for the eyeliner brush which needs to be stiff, the brushes are super soft.  The handles feel great in my hand.  The only thing I&#x27;m not wild about is the design of the case.  Yes, it&#x27;s sturdier to protect the brushes, and yes, it can serve as an open holder.  But because it divides itself halfway and because the snap arms stick straight up, it&#x27;s somewhat awkward to cap the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good set for most uses.  Unless you&#x27;re an expert at makeup application and need more precision/range of sizes, this set should meet most needs.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> Surprised my wife with this kit.  She likes the refined case it comes in as well as the big brush, which is extra soft and doesn&#x27;t shed a bit.  Not sure how often she uses the rest of the pack, but it is top quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes come sealed in plastic and in a tube like but sturdy finished holder that almost feels like leather. The set of brushes is just as described -- and in my opinion much better then in the picture.  They are so soft, they hold their hair, you know you are not picking off hair from your face when you use them and I appreciate that it brings all the basic size brushes . I think they are made very well of great value, I love the holder it snaps on the sides and you can fit it a suitcase easily when you travel. Great product for the price in my book</li>
    <li> Very nice set and I love the box that it came in.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but I think overpriced</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  Each one has the perfect bristles for it&#x27;s purpose.  I also love the fact that they are each labeled for use.  These would be perfect for people like me who are beginners in the make-up world and also those who know everything about make-up (make-up artists etc.).  I really enjoy using these brushes to help me try out new products.  I love them all, however my favorite is the blending brush.  That brush is the perfect thickness and softness for blending eye shadow.  I absolutely don&#x27;t do my eyes without it now.  The carrying case conveniently stores the brushes and has a lot of room left over for my other brushes as well.  I highly recommend these brushes to anyone wanting to try a new set.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I wanted to try something new and the price was very reasonable. To be honest, I was not expecting much but this set is AMAZING! The bristles are soft, they pick up just the right amount of product and they are full-sized! The case is also very well-made and durable.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about buying it, just do it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this set to all the make-up lovers out there.</li>
    <li> I got the Keshima &amp;#34;Must-Have Set of Makeup Brushes&amp;#34; for my wife. The makeup brush set includes an eyeliner brush, an angled blush brush, an eyeshadow brush, a powder brush, and a blending brush. There is also an impressive looking oval brush holder that splits into 2 cups in which you can keep the brushes. And it all comes in a very nice gift box.&lt;br /&gt;My wife really likes the brushes, and says they are of much higher quality than her older ones (which, granted, cost somewhat less). She says the brushes are very comfortable, give a smooth and even application, and while there was a little shedding (very little, she says) with the first use of a couple of the makeup brushes, even that was gone with further use.&lt;br /&gt;She also likes the case, because it is roomy enough to hold all her brushes with no problems, looks real good, and with it having a snap closure on it, she can pack this makeup brush set safely in her luggage.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> When purchasing make-up brushes, quality of the brushes was my priority. This is a premium price for mediocre brushes with a fabulous large, bulky leather case. &amp;#34;MUST-HAVE&amp;#34; makeup brushes with &amp;#34;PREMIUM HOLDER&amp;#34;. It says it all in the headline. I&#x27;d rather have spent the cash on &amp;#34;PREMIUM MAKE-UP BRUSHES.</li>
    <li> This is a very high-quality set, although so far I have only tried the angled blush and one of the eyeshadows. I was especially struck by the softness of the bristles. They feel great against my skin. I ordered another brush set previously that had two large brushes but neither one was angled, so I appreciated the angled blush brush in this one. I also thought it was a nice touch that the type of brush is labeled right on the handle. I was surprised by the heft of the case; it&#x27;s sturdy and feels like leather. Overall, a great buy! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The brushes are GORGEOUS!!!  I love the way that they feel when using them, and they come in a lovely carrying/storage case.  Love it!  Not a lot of shedding of the bristles, which is what I hate the most about some brushes, so that&#x27;s also a bonus!  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how they clean and then dry again for repeated use.</li>
    <li> I really love this set.  Unlike others, I actually love the angled blush brush, and the blending brush works really well.  The case is rather large and heavy, but provides good protection.  I am going to buy a set for my niece for her birthday!</li>
    <li> I received the brushes today and couldn&#x27;t resist to try them!  The packaging was pretty impressive, just like the picture.  Once i took the brush case out of the box, I was even more pleasantly surprised with the quality of the brush case itself.  It has claps at the sides to open.  The brush case is a sturdy leather like case, which  would look great standing up on any makeup table. Its a great way to keep the brushes organized without getting dusty or laying around picking up dirt.  So as much as I was impressed with the packaging and brush case, I was even more in love with the brushes themselves.  The brushes compare to some of the best quality brushes on the market.  The bristles are super soft, and do not fall out at all. They feel like velvet on the skin. I love theta these brushes come in a set and I can use one for bronzer/ foundation and another one for blush and others for eye makeup and lips!  A great startup kit of brushes any girl would love.  I am totally in love! I can&#x27;t wait to start using them regularly and will be recommending these brushes to my friends.</li>
    <li> Got it quickly and now I&#x27;ve gotten a chance to use them.  They seem really nice. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!  These brushes are very soft to use.  The holder is great, because it will sit on any counter.  Very easy to remember to place them back and not just lay them down to get lost!  These would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> I recently received my makeup brushes and I love them!!! The case is amazing and so are the brushes. I can&#x27;t thank you enough!! Loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recently received my makeup brushes and I love them!!! The case is amazing and so are the brushes. I can&#x27;t thank you enough!! Loved it!!! Well made and gorgeous brush set!!!</li>
    <li> I was VERY impressed with this brush set! I had no idea it would be such great quality, what a deal for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are not only great quality, but the storage container is as well. Very well made and sturdy, looks nice on my makeup table and would make an EXCELLENT gift!</li>
    <li> These are great, super soft, awesome case, high quality product.  I would recommend or buy for a friend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this set, especially the flat kabuki brush. The brushes look to be well made and of decent quality (though my daughter hasn&#x27;t used them yet). The leather-like container that houses the brush set may just be my favorite part (I know that Sigma charges $25 for an almost identical container) as it is sturdy and can be used to transport the brushes or can be separated into 2 separate brush holders. The company that makes the brushes sent a thank you email, encouraging us to contact them with any questions or concerns (I thought that was a nice touch). We have yet to wash the brushes, which is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5. So far, I would recommend this set, but I will update after my daughter uses and washes the brushes.</li>
    <li> very impressed with the value of this set - the brushes feel great and i look forward to using them each time!</li>
    <li> There are so many reasons I like this set. For starters, I’m so impressed with the quality and affordability of the set. I love the carrying case, it’s a sleek, faux leather black brush case with popper fasteners which divides into two sections. I like that it helps keep your makeup brushes protected and clean when travelling. I was so happy to be able to review this set. My overall opinion is that this is a great brush set. I like that you get a nice variety of brushes for the price. I’ve been using them for a week now and they are still just as soft as when I got them. I also liked that after washing them there wasn’t any shedding, which is great. They are very soft yet dense. While they all work great alone, they work wonders when they are used together.</li>
    <li> Wonderful set.  Really enjoying it.  Would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and holder.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....These brushes worked really well applying my makeup. After i began using the brushes I could tell the difference using the blending brush. My makeup was flawless. I love them. Will buy again</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful.  They feel so soft and light.  I love the carry case as it is a hard case so I do not have to worry about the brushes deforming when I put them away.  I love that this set comes with various sizes.  All of the brushes feel wonderful on your face.  With these brushes putting on makeup does not feel tedious.  It feels like you are pampering yourself because of how soft and high quality these brushes are.  I am extremely happy that I was able to own this product at a promotional price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.  I am definitely recommending them to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Amazing though. These makeup brushes are so soft! When I received them in the mail I was so excited especially because of the Brush holder and then the Brushes . I also washed them before any use. I really like the design of these brushes. I&#x27;m always looking for sturdy soft brushes and these are it ! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice make up brush  I really love it!</li>
    <li> As a makeup enthusiast, I have several brushes for all different uses. I have tried many brands from the top of the line department and private labels ones to some they are in drug stores. Each ranges in quality depending on the manufacturer and some are more coarse of a fiber than others.  This particular makeup crush set from Keshima came with exceptional quality brushes as well as a great case for on the go applications.  I received this makeup set at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  I also use bare minerals for every day use and the kabuki brush was great for the foundation. The bristles are very soft and have a luxurious feel to them. The handles are a great length for applying makeup on yourself or as an amateur makeup artist, for my clients as well.  The quality of these brushes are close to that of ones that I have from high end department stores and private label ones. If you&#x27;re a makeup junkie and love applying makeup or just looking for a new set, this is a set that you want to keep in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my significant other to have as a backup when she visits or we travel. She has raved about how soft the brushes are and that the variety is perfect...she has all the brushes that she needs! The case is such high quality and snaps shut on the sides making it easy to toss in a bag and go if you want to travel with it. It is also elegant if you want to sit in on a bathroom counter. The only brush she hasn&#x27;t used is the eyeliner brush, but she said the others are just as good as the MAC ones at her house. Great set for a great price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these brushes! Great quality and for a reasonable price. The case is a sturdy faux leather that is lovely to look at and great for traveling. I will be buying more of them as gifts!</li>
    <li> I am loving these brushes!!!!  They are incredibly soft and do not shed at all.  It&#x27;s hard to find a really good blender brush and this one is just about perfect!  The little case they come in is pretty awesome too.  It is very sturdy and even breaks down into two parts - I use one for clean brushes and one for brushes that need to be cleaned.  The case makes traveling super easy with my brushes!  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this set!!! I am very picky about my makeup brushes. The brushes are soft and great to use! I love love love the case these brushes come in. Its not your typical plastic brush carrier, its durable and cleanly made. I love the snaps on the sides so when I travel I can just secure these brushes in the case and put it in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and my daughter in law have both asked me if they could have this. Me being the peace keeper, I will keep it. Ha! The description of this product does not do it enough justice. It is stunning in it&#x27;s leather like case and the two snaps on either side make it easy to travel with. I&#x27;m no expert on cosmetics but I find the brushes to be well made and of higher quality than what you would find in the stores. The case is much taller than the picture looks like it would be too. Overall, I think it is great and would recommend to anyone who applies cosmetics professional or otherwise. :)</li>
    <li> Very good quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are FANTASTIC!! Great value! I LOVE THESE!!!!</li>
    <li> 1. Excellent case! But a bit bigger and heavy for my taste. Specially, in a time where &amp;#34;lbs and $&amp;#34; are of the essence!&lt;br /&gt;2. Excellent bristles, soft and right amount.&lt;br /&gt;3. Very good brushes. Nice grip. Very good size, not as small as most brushes made nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;4. Excellent price for this starting up set.&lt;br /&gt;5. Overall, an excellent purchase. I highly recommend this set. In fact, I am I&#x27;ll be ordering a second one for my sister&#x27;s birthday!</li>
    <li> I love these make-up brushes, and them coming in their own little cute container is a plus. Very easy to travel with. I have been using these for a little over a week, and they still look new. Plus they keep their bristles! So far I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! You will not be disappointed by the quality. The carrying case is really nice and well made also.</li>
    <li> I relly liked the brushes .. They are so profissional and hope to have extra more special brushes</li>
    <li> Great Product! Would repurchase</li>
    <li> good quality and very nice case to keep them stored.</li>
    <li> I was SERIOUSLY IMPRESSED with the quality of these brushes!!  The bristles don&#x27;t come off, like a lot of brushes.  I am very picky when it comes to my make up brushes, because I invest in High End makeup.  The packaging on these is great!  the leather case that they come in is VERY NICE!  It is large and sturdy, with heavy clips to hold it together.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to ANYBODY that is looking for a High Quality make up brush set!!!</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are awesome!! They also come in a nice case that&#x27;s easy to store them in as well as travel with if you need to. Best brushes I&#x27;ve found!!</li>
    <li> Loved all the brushes. Quality is great. Great case too! Everything is bigger than it looks in the photos. Can&#x27;t wait for Keshima&#x27;s next product.</li>
    <li> The brushes were high quality and the case is very nice.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Overall I am pleased with the brushes. After reading the reviews, I had high hopes of finding brushes that wouldn&#x27;t shed on my face. The powder brush was the only disappointment. It sheds badly when I try to use it. However, I love all the other brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes were such a great deal for their amazing quality!</li>
    <li> Nice brush set, the case is larger than I prefer but otherwise very soft brushes and excellent customer service from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful buy.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the reasonable prices for these brushes.  The quality is great.  The holder is much bigger than it shows. It is about 10 inches tall.  I leave it open and use both halves as brush holders.  It looks great and is very handy.</li>
    <li> Quality brushes at an affordable price. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, sturdy case but big, hardly a travel case</li>
    <li> I found this a good set for most of my makeup needs. I took a star off because the powder brush kept on shedding. I&#x27;ve contacted Keshima about it and they were very prompt!  I was offered another set with a new powder brush batch. Very pleased with the fast Keshima reply, so I only took a star off. About the rest of the set I must say the other brushes did not shed at all, so probably I was unlucky and got a defective powder brush. My favorite is definitely the Kabuki brush- definitely the best I&#x27;ve used so far. The bristles are very soft,  very densely packed, and it holds at the top all my liquid foundation or my mineral powder so I get a great coverage. I found the powder brush very soft-it&#x27;s a shame that my set had a defective one. The brushes with white hair had harder bristles, so I&#x27;m not  a big fan of them but still did a good job. Also, I liked the travel case that could be snapped into two and used as a holder- very useful in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with these brushes and would buy again this set.</li>
    <li> I was super excited about these brushes. Once they arrived I immedantly wanted to try them out. The Keshima set comes with an angled blush brush, eyeliner brush, powder brush, eyeshadow brush, and blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;***** IT ALSO INCLUDES A 6TH BRUSH - THE KESHIMA FLAT TOP KABUKI BRUSH - THE PERFECT FOUNDATION BRUSH. *****&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a makeup brush holder - very elegant, durable and easy to clean. Looks to be made out of a leather material. Its very nice!!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are made with a nice quality hairs, and very soft. Applies make up perfectly. I have four other make up brush sets and tend to use these the most. I love that it comes with an angle blush brush. Not a huge fan of the blender brush, I tend to find it a bit course and scratchy. I also like that each of the brush handles has the name, of what each brush is.&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received these to test and review and this review is 100% my own opinion!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. The case has good weight to it. It&#x27;s nice and sturdy and I can see it lasting a long time. The brushes are super soft and feel of good quality.</li>
    <li> These make up brushes are way better than the ones I have had. I love the little flat top brush it makes of smooth blending they&#x27;re easy to clean they don&#x27;t leave any pieces behind if your a big makeup person these make up brushes are great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush set is very portable with a nice case and the brushes are very well made. They are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate skin like other makeup applicators I&#x27;ve used in the past. Set comes with most every brush you would ever need. I&#x27;ve only owned them for a little while, but I&#x27;d recommend this product if you are in need of better brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes that never shed!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and it paid off! The kabuki is the best I&#x27;ve ever used  just a solid set for face, eye, liner (real nice, just firm enough)blush &amp; contour. I will buy again. The case was super nice but I ditched it immediately since I&#x27;m not a world traveler.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s 40th birthday. She says that she found the perfect make-up brushes. They work great wonders for her and I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re going to be very appreciated by every other wife, woman or girl. These make-up brushes by KESHIMA are truly a must have.</li>
    <li> WOW AMAZING BRUSHES!!! This for sure are professional. I love how well they work and how awesome they are!  I would recommed to any woman that wears make up</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast.  I was quite surprised to see such unique packing.  The cup turns into a case which would make it very easy to protect the brushes when traveling.  The brushes are quite superior to other brushes that I have used.  My makeup applied very smoothly and even.  The brush bristles felt heavenly against my skin.  I love, love, love these brushes.  You most definitely would want to have a set for your own.  They would also make great gifts.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the BEST!!  And I absolutely LOVE the fact that the container they come in has a snap on lid to make travel easy and I know my brushes are protected inside.  The brushes are soft but I can tell that they are high quality and should last a very long time.  I cannot say enough about how much I love these!  I think I may need to order another set for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great product and beautiful case! I will be buying more as gifts for Christmas. The brushes are of very great quality and a good variety for everyday makeup application. I have owned a variety of very expensive brushes...MAC, Mary Kay, Clinique, Bare Minerals, Origins...this set is just as high quality and the brushes are really soft. This is a great price to have all the brushes you need! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this set, and it comes in a very nice pouch you can carry around in your hand bag.</li>
    <li> My Keshima Makeup Brush Set arrived!  I have to say that I am thrilled with this set!  I was really pleased that the container was made of leather and that it had snaps on each side to open and close it.  I also liked that the black leather was subtly embossed with the KESHIMA name.  Very classy!  The brushes are fantastic.  I used each one as it was meant to be used. I used very good quality make up products to see how each brush performed. My favorite is the eyeshadow brush.  It picked up just the right amount of the shadow and it applied like silk!  It didn&#x27;t drop any shadow down on my lower eyes as sometimes happens with other products.  The blending brush performed beautifully also.  I am a minimalist when it comes to eyeliner but I can say that the eyeliner brush held enough product from the corner of my eye to the outer edge of my lashes in one stroke.  The width of the line was perfect also!  I tried a little contouring using the angled brush which resulted in a new look for my face that I really liked! I finished by applying a light veil mineral powder with the Powder brush. I have to say that my powder has never gone on that lightly and evenly when using the brush that came with the product.  Overall, I rate KESHIMA  Make Up Brush Set OUTSTANDING!  I will definitely be watching for more from this company. Thank you for creating a top-notch yet affordable brush set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, soft and work well</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I am very impressed with these brushes.  Comes with a great, classy carrying case.  Nice quality.  Would make an impressive gift for any makeup lover!</li>
    <li> I must say that after years of applying foundation with a sponge, this is the best application method I&#x27;ve ever used. The brush evenly distributes the foundation and makes your skin appear flawless. It is easy to use and the results are stunning. I will never go back!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush set. Very nice presentation. Brushes work exceptionally well and are easy to clean. No shedding at all. Huge plus.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the case, it&#x27;s initially why I bought this set. I also was looking forward to the blending brush. The eyeshadow brush is really great as well. The blush brush fibers are a tiny bit rougher than I would like, but I do like how it is white so I can see the product on the bristles. Overall I do recommend this kit, the case is really great quality. I use both halves to hold all my makeup brushes on my bathroom counter and it keeps them tidy, and of course it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this handy 5-piece brush set. The case is black and luxurious. My friends were asking me where did I get it :) All 5 feel so good in a hand and it is a pleasure using them. The brushes leave a silky feeling on my face and most importantly, they do not shed! I do keep them stored in a case, they should last for lifetime. Absolutely 5/star professional brushes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to gift my little sister on her birthday. When I was looking for a gift on Amazon, I came across this Makeup Brushes Set with Brush Holder. My sister loved it and she started using the brushes right away. She also liked the blending brushes very much. It seems like a quality makeup set and I guess my sister would be able to use it for a long period of time. If you are looking for a gift to your little sister, this is the best option available in the market to consider buying.</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply amazing . Wonderful quality at a low cost . There&#x27;s my make up down below and there&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t do with my new brushes . Thanks guys !!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome set. It blends well and makes applying make up easy.  I will definitely be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are actually pretty decent quality! The case it comes in is great and durable!! The kabuki brush in comparison the to the SigmaF80 is only 6/10. I don&#x27;t think any kabuki is going to match SigmasF80 though. That being said you can get definitely get decent results from it still. I like the liner brush a lot. Its got the perfect amount of stiffness and flexibility. The shadow brushes worked fine for me also the only brush that I really don&#x27;t care for is the white contour brush. I will say these have not had much shedding at all. I am a makeup artist and have worked with MAC, Sigma, Real Techniques, and now these.</li>
    <li> Wow the set is wonderful and the bonus Kabuki brush is perfect. It works great with my new Bare Minerals make up.</li>
    <li> Super soft! Blended make-up beautifully.</li>
    <li> Very good set of brushes! Thanks</li>
    <li> Brushes are much higher quality than I expected.  They come in a very nice case.</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist and i came across tjos brushes and decided to give it a chance and i really like them. Very good quality and no shedding.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. No bristles have fallen out yet. I have had it for a whIle now and it does the job well. I love the eyeshadow brush mostly, it blends very well.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing set of makeup brushes. It comes in a makeup holder that is a great way of organizing and storing the brushes when not in use. If you are like me I have makeup  and brushes everywhere. This keeps them in one spot. This set comes with all the essential makeup brushes: blush brush, eyeliner brush, powder brush, eyeshadow brush, and blending brush. All the brushes are durable and of exceptional quality. This set is now my go-to set to use daily, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> I recently went on trip to visit a friend and she had this set and I had to get it too. The brushes are really soft and the case is durable and great for travel. I would easily buy this again, but it doesn&#x27;t look like I will need to for awhile, maybe as a gift!</li>
    <li> The case alone makes getting these make-up brushes worth it.  Very nice way to package them and there&#x27;s even enough room left for my own makeup (eyeline, mascara - i put them in with it). Would make a GREAT christmas gift. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just received the set.  Looks good so far.  Looking to try them.</li>
    <li> i ordered this because of the reviews i read for this product,. once i recieved it i washed it in plain water bcz it smelled some plastics /paint. dried it and then tried to apply foundation.. i hated it for two reasons..: 1. bristles all over my face  2. was not very soft and since i have sensitive skin it hurted me ... had to wash my face in cold water... this is going back.</li>
    <li> All the brushes in the must have set are amazing..for those beginners like me, this set is for you..you have to try it..its worth your money..super love it..</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome for the price!</li>
    <li> Completely under impressed!!!!  I have only ever used MAC and Chanel brushes but with this item having so many great reviews, I took the chance and purchased this set.  While the case is nice and the bonus kabuki brush does a nice job the other brushes just aren&#x27;t impressive.  There is no substitute for great makeup brushes.  If you want less expensive brushes, I heart artist brushes from Michaels and art supply stores work well in lieu of high end cosmetic brushes.</li>
    <li> This set is truly professional grade quality. All the brushes are very well made and the case is made of leather over a tough construction. They will last for a long time with proper care.</li>
    <li> The is an awesome makeup brush set!! My makeup is applying so much more flawlessly with quality brushes. It is pretty surprising the difference it makes having quality makeup brushes. The case is sturdy and so convenient. You can put the cover on or leave the cover off to have an open topped brush holder.</li>
