<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received on time, as described. Well packed. Thanks.</li>
    <li> item arrived leaking product but works well</li>
    <li> I love VC cream because it may my skin smooth and glowing. This moisturizer blends really well and it absorbs quickly into the pores. I use this one after the VC serum and the result so far is amazing. I love the very light scent this one has. It has a pump and no germs will get into the bottle ever, that is whynI hate the jars. For this price, the result is comparable to higher end department store skin care. Loving it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, the only problem it won&#x27;t deliver too much moisture to my skin, this is ideal for a person with mixed skin, I am a woman who&#x27;s age is in the early 50&#x27;s so I am needing more moisture and hydration from my face products than a woman in her 30&#x27;s or even 40&#x27;s, I like this product and the bottle has a nice dispenser, air tight, good size and price very affordable, as much as I know is odorless, nice bottle presentation, I will use this product for summer time, but I am not on winter time, I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> InstaNaturals Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer is a lovely light cream that really penetrates and gets good results.  I got this on a promotin as I have become a big fan of this all natural facial products line.  I have been using the InstaNaturals Vitamin C serum religiously after seeing great results from it, once at night the again in the morning before moisturizing day cream and a light foundation. When I saw this Vitamin C in a cream moisturizer the light bulb of course went on and I now use the Vitamin C serum in the evening and then this lovely cream moisturizing formula in the morning under a light foundation.  I love how it sinks in quickly but makes my makeup foundation glides on so much better with the moisturizer compared to the serum.  Way to go InstaNatural can&#x27;t wait to see what other great facial products you have in the works!</li>
    <li> I like this feels nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this vitamin C cream to help with my melasma (hyper pigmentation mustache). I havent been using it long enough to notice a difference in the pigmentation but my skin does seem softer and tighter. I also use this as a makeup primer!</li>
    <li> I have noticed better conditioned, firmer skin with use if this product!</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash and dried my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream w Ultimate C skin repair serum. I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased the InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream. I loved it, but figured I&#x27;d try a couple to see which I prefer best. This stuff is ok, but I&#x27;ll be returning to my original purchase</li>
    <li> I loved this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this moisturizer ~ it lives up to its promises.  My face stays moisturized for hours!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t greasy, though it does take a few moments to be absorbed by my skin. A little goes a long way. It has a pleasant smell. I love the Vitamin C lotion and what this moisturizer has done to improve my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried several moisturizers, most much more expensive than this line, through the years and nothing can compare to Insta Naturals. This is the first product I found that does not feel heavy or thick on my face and does not cause me to breakout. I went into surgical menopause at 33 and developed brown spots on my forehead and the sides of my face. This is the first product I have ever used that has dramatically lightened these spots, and in the case of my forehead, completely erased them in the 1 month I have been using it. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Burns terrible after a shave.  Greasy.</li>
    <li> This has brightened my complexion while helping to  diminish the appearance of pores.  It quickly absorbs into your skin with out feeling greasy or sticky . I love how my skin feels and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after I have been using for a longer period of time .  Would recommend this product and continue to use</li>
    <li> OK, i&#x27;m always skeptical of facial moisturizers. I&#x27;ve gone through so many, drugstore to expensive brands. My skin is very sensitive and battled acned for years.. This by far is the best.  It does not make me break out, or leave me greasy. It moisturizes really well.  I have combination skin. The pump bottle is so convenient over the jars where you have risk of bacteria contamination.  The price point is just right too comparable to other good moisturizers. Please don&#x27;t change the formula and the price. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this about a week but I have to say I like it. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and really moisturizies. And it could be my imagination but I really do think my skin feels tighter. It&#x27;s perfectly comfortable to wear under makeup since it feels so thin.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  Have been using it for 3 weeks and I see the difference in the brown spots on my face have faded.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it feeling heavy.  It is very light and penetrates skin quickly.  I&#x27;m North American Indian and have purchased a lot of different moisturizers saying they will fade dark spots and believe me I have spent a lot of money on expensive products  with no results.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Had to give it away because it made my face break out.  I have a sensitive face.</li>
    <li> Another great he cream for so many uses and leaves your skin feeling soft and moist all day but never greasy !!!</li>
    <li> I am all about using vitamin C on my skin.  I have had many skin issues including spots of cancer cells removed.  My skin is extremely dry and dehydrated.  This product is very helpful in helping re-hydrate my face.  My routine starts with an exfoliating sugar scrub first.  Then I add a vitamin C serum.  Next I moisturize with Vitamin C cream.  It has helped smooth out my skin problems.  Enjoying this and other InstaNatural products.  Happy to get a discount so I could report my honest opinion.  I will be re-purchasing this moisturizer when I run out.</li>
    <li> I like this best of all the similar formulas I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the first face cream where I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference.  I do put either argon oil or jojoba oil over the top of it to seal it in.  When I put it on under makeup -- even mineral makeup -- I don&#x27;t see all the tiny fine lines on my face.  I also like the way it dispenses -- you push down on it and the perfect amount for your face appears on the top.  You just scoop that up and apply, with no waste.  Yes, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, and kept my face soft, however it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent if you are a fan of scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.  My face used to be a little rough well not rough but not soft. And now it&#x27;s as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
    <li> I have finished the Instanatural Retinol cream and now I am more excited to start with the vitamin C moisturizer. And as expected, instanatural made my skin smoother as ever. I try to use it every night and I wake up to a more supple and vibrant skin! Now my only problem is the oiliness, since I have a very oily skin. Overall my skin is really smooth and lovely. I trust Instanatural for my skin care, they have really good products.</li>
    <li> It says that this is an anytime face cream but honestly I would only use it before bed. It takes awhile to soak in so if your rushing in the morning and don&#x27;t have time to wait for a lotion to dry then this isn&#x27;t the lotion for you. After it soaks in my skin was super hydrated the rest of the day so I will continue to use it in the evening before bed as it does seem to work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few time because I only received it.  BUT, I can honestly say that my skin has never looked better at 51!!! I am a beauty cream junkie! Always looking for the so called &amp;#34;best cream ever.&amp;#34; I ordered their face mask which I love, so I decided to explore their other products. Lo and behold, their creams and serums have the highest stars on Amazon, so of course I decided to try. Well, well, well....I&#x27;m glad I did.  The price is justified for the amount of product you get. So, I will continue to use their products and I am confident that I will be very pleased with the long term results.  I will post a follow-up review after a few weeks. 5/24/15 Follow-up: My skin has never been better. I noticed that my skin stays moisturized all day leaving me with supple skin and less noticeable wrinkles. I hope InstaNatural will keep making this cream because I am a fan for life. Same goes for their eye cream and their night cream. 5 star is warranted (all three products).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky about moisturizers because I have dry but sensitive skin. This is a nice consistency that absorbs nicely. No greasy residue left on the surface of the skin and the natural ingredients keep my skin from freaking out.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this lotion in conjunction with  Vitamin C Serum. I love the results! I like how Vitamin C can be used to protect skin, since I’m not a huge fan of face creams with SPF (they make me break out). So this is a great alternative! I also think it’s great how versatile this lotion is, it’s good for all skin types and other parts of the body. It is also light-weight and not greasy feeling. That is definitely a plus, since my skin runs oily. I don’t need any extra oily on face, haha! Overall, a great product. I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> The holiday’s are here and that means it is definitely winter in New York which leads to my skin being extra dry. Winter time is bitter sweet in the beauty department because I have great hair in the winter my curls have more bounce and last longer but my skin that’s another story. My skin just gets so dry and just feels rough, It would be nice to have that summer sun kissed glow all year long. On my quest to find that glow I happened to get my hands on a bottle of Retinol Moisturizer with vitamin C and had to give it a try. Here’s the scoop on this bottle of magic, and I call it magic because the moisturizer is intense, jojoba oil and Shea butter are my favorites. Surprisingly there barely any scent it is just fresh and soothing on my skin. It is not greasy, I must say I am happy with my results because my skin feel great after just one use. This moisturizer its very absorbent so my dry skin looks great. I will definitely be using this on a regular.</li>
    <li> i love the smell however i am liking the other moisturizer better from instanatural is it me? maybe i am stuck on the other this one is great though for after my tanning wipes add this just to make sure my tan is even i love it yes but no still stuck on the other one, i can&#x27;t help it though, i did ask what gave all instanatural products there wonderful smell and the answer i got i should have known since there all natural it was the smell of the products organics that make the smell not any perfume i felt so silly! It&#x27;s not oily so my tan stuff doesn&#x27;t move at all and you know how sometimes tan stuff can streak well i wanted to use a moisturizer just to be safe, no clogged nasty pores thank goodness for InstaNatural! I want to see more products like this and the past, i want to see them up the stakes there a great company with fast delivery and customer service and i just want to see them get bigger, there reasonable prices and there products they should!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a good (not too heavy) moisturizer that is perfect for under foundation. Love the high percentage of vitamin c, and active ingredients. I layer this over the vitamin c serum, and let it sink in for at least 15 minutes before applying my makeup. I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivities or break outs due to using.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my skin moist but not shiny... I just started using it so can&#x27;t say if it will help with wrinkles but I am enjoying the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit heavy BUT it goes on very light, no scent and doesn&#x27;t give me an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; sheen.  I love it and I think I see some reduction of the very fine 58-year young lines! Nice size! Not a skimpy little fraction of an ounce.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about two weeks now. I love how creamy the product is. I would say it absorbs very quickly  and make my lines appear more blurred . I use it twice a day for maximum results. I would recommend this product to any one who wants a high quality product with visible results  “Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I live in Wisconsin, and the winter weather had roughed up my skin.  After using this cream for a few days, my face feels smooth again.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, non greasy, non sticky, feels good to use.  I have tried quite a few different vitamin C serums and moisturizers and this is the best one tried so I will stick with it.  Also the company has excellent customer service, they fixed a wrong product delivery instantly with a free replacement - can&#x27;t fault them there.</li>
    <li> I use this as a daytime moisturizer. My makeup applies wonderfully and stays fresh all day. I love it! &amp;#34;Product provided for free for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love love love this moisturizer. I use it over my InstaNaturals serum and sometimes alone.  It&#x27;s light but very moisturizing.  I have super dry skin and this has worked wonders. It absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft.  My makeup sets nicely over it.  When I sweat it doesn&#x27;t melt and slide off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Not for me! This did not work well with my skin. It seemed to clog my pores and made my face break out. Now I have a huge pimple on my cheek and below my nose. I gave it to my daughter to see if it will work better on her skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel so smooth, it&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
    <li> This product was provided free to me for product review.  Upon initial application of  the Vitamin C Moisturizer for Face, I was bit unsure of the texture.  When applying this moisturizer on the skin, it  has a foaming up appearance, which I have grown to love.  Once massaged into the skin it completely sinks into your skin. I have an oily to normal skin type and have had absolutely no trouble with breakouts.  The texture of my skin has become much smoother to the touch.  I have fallen in love with this product and will certainly recommend to my friends and also repurchase myself.  Thank you for an awesome product !!</li>
    <li> I wish I had before and after pictures of my neck.  My order of Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer arrived about 4 weeks ago, and I use it everyday, sometimes twice a day after a quick face and neck wash and ever since my skin is looking and feeling softer, smoother and naturally moist. Even more noticeable is my neck area! Gently messaging the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer to my neck area and especially right under my chin is making it look a lot less wrinkly little by little. The neck area is hard to treat, so seeing such an improvement to my neck, tells me the moisturizer is really contributing to helping my face look better, just as I stated earlier.  I use this product in conjunction with TrueSkin Naturals a liquid Vitamin C+E blended together in same bottle and comes with a dropper and in my opinion; the two compliment each other and are working well together for me using both products on my face and my neck.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have tried many great vitamin C serums but this is the first moisturizer I have ever used with vitamin C. I like the fact that this cream includes a high concentration of vitamin C just like in a serum. I like to know that I could use this cream by itself or right after a serum. Either case my skin will get plenty of vitamin C, which is a well known anti aging ingredient. The cream comes out through a pump so there is no chgance for contamination by fingers. It is absorbed by the skin quite fast and it is does not irritate the skin at all. I have been using it right after my vitamin C serum at night and stand alone in the morning. I am hoping that the 22% vitamin C in the serum and the 20 % in this cream will be intense enough to improve the dark blotches on my cheeks and my forehead. I have read that vitamin C helps to lighten up the darkened skin. I am keeping my fingers crossed. This product was provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and I am loving it! I am using it along with their vitamin C serum and the combo has been great for my very oily/ hormonal skin ( I am currently almost 8 months pregnant). Everything I used before these products made me break out. It has not been the case with this. It is just enough moisturizer where I don&#x27;t end up a greasy mess a couple of hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I received this moisturizer as a sample to provide my honest feedback on. Nevertheless, this does not affect my opinion on the efficacy. Here are my thoughts on InstaNatural&#x27;s vitamin c moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 20% vitamin c moisturizer includes ingredients like MSM, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and plant stem cells. I like this combination because the vitamin c helps to even out your complexion and although it can be drying, especially during the winter season, with hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, your skin stays moisturized for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer comes in a huge 3.4 fl. oz. size which can seem excessive. However, I find that I&#x27;ve developed a habit where I use this more often throughout the day. For some, this may lead to more skin peeling or developing a resistance to the ingredients with frequent use. With my stubborn skin, more applications throughout the day have greatly improved my skin appearance. The acne scarring I&#x27;ve had has faded and my skin looks brighter. The only thing that hasn&#x27;t improved as much is the size of my pores, which to be fair I don&#x27;t think any topical product can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my neck and eye are. As far as my neck area, it hasn&#x27;t changed drastically neither has it gotten worse so only more time will tell if it can help that area. With my eye area, I have noticed that my upper eye area is less &#x27;papery&#x27; and feels/looks more moisturized. The deep lines I have under my eyes are still there so this hasn&#x27;t done much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will definitely recommend this for people who have hyperpigmentation, scarring, uneven tone, etc as it worked for me (and I have EXTREMELY STUBBORN SKIN). With continued use, it will help to resurface your skin gently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, the eye serum and the Vit C serum for about a month now.  Not only can I tell a difference so can other people as they&#x27;ve complimented me on my skin or asked what I&#x27;ve been doing different.  For what it is, it&#x27;s cheap compared to other products with the same ingredients.  I wrote a lengthy detailed review of all 3 on the eye serum...check it out.  And I did NOT receive this for free or at any discount.  I bought it out right and would do it again.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m going to start by saying instanatural is a great brand. They are a truly natural company, not a \\&quot;green washed\\&quot; one. I&#x27;ve never used their products before, so when I was offered this product to test and leave feedback on I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as price goes, this is a steal! The ingredients are top notch. I craft and sell skincare products (on a very small scale... And budget) I know the prices on most the ingredients and some are very expensive. So you&#x27;re getting a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this broke me out SO bad. I toughed it out for a week before stopping. (Just so you know, I tend to break out with a lot of things. If coconut oil even looks my way my skin morphs into a 13 year old boy&#x27;s.)  Don&#x27;t discount this product unless you can relate to my skin woes! I ended up giving this to my mom and she is loving it. One thing I didn&#x27;t care for is that it goes on fairly heavy, it&#x27;s definitely not a lightweight, fast absorbing moisturizer. That&#x27;s no big deal, but I found that once it absorbed it still left my face feeling a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> Probably good for other people.  Unfortunately, my skin type was allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Everyone should be using this. I look forward to bedtime when I get to wash my face and apply this stuff because in the morning ur face looks so soft and almost dewy. U look awake. I love it. I&#x27;ve recorded it a few times now. The best part I should mention is how its affected my &#x27;scowl lines&#x27; they aren&#x27;t as prominent any more. I didn&#x27;t buy this to cure that but one day I just noticed how much softer that area looks. Its just a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I have not had this product very long. If I begin to see changes in my skin, I will change my rating to a five. So far I am enjoying the feel of the product and the way it makes my skin feel. I am using it every day and hope to see a difference in the dark spots on the side of my face. Will review again later</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely after clean skin prep and is not greasy or overly moisturzing.  Leaves skintone with a nice even glow.</li>
    <li> Since my face is quite oily I tend to use lighter products to reduce shine on my face. Though this is not very heavy I need to test on a day when I&#x27;m not going anywhere to make sure it doesn&#x27;t add shine. I have been using it as a body lotion mixing it with an inexpensive lotion so that it spreads more easily and I love it. It spreads well, moisturizes and smells really good. Sort of smells like a light citrus. Not heavy at all. I wish they made it in a larger size ( although this is large- I am using for body). Use it on my décolletage and think it works well!&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> great product. I really like the packaging and the way the cream feels when it comes out of the pump. I have received compliments on my skin from strangers. Considering I am about to turn 59 it feels good. I apply it on my face and on my hands. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it 3 weeks. I&#x27;m always concerned about moisturizer causing my breakout to get worse, and I&#x27;m hesitant about new products. I really enjoy this and I use the vitamin C serum with it, with the retinol in it. It&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> just found this and ordred some more. it&#x27;s like a face lift in a jar! people asked if i had lost weight!&lt;br /&gt;haha.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth moisturizer that smell like vitamin C so you know it&#x27;s good for your skin!</li>
    <li> Very nice feel. Rubs in easily and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly three months now.  Enough is enough. I tried to give my skin some time to get used to the new moisturizer. NEVER have I had this happen to me. I&#x27;m almost 27, I&#x27;ve got combination oily skin in the T-zone. If I have a break out it&#x27;s on the sides of my chin, usually where I rest my chin on the back of my hand without thinking.  I swear it&#x27;s gotta be this product because it&#x27;s the newest thing I&#x27;ve added to my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for ewww factor, I added a picture. The red bumps have actually gone down significantly in the picture. They&#x27;ll appear on the front of my nose, on the sides, tiny little, bright red bumps. I don&#x27;t have any off the wall allergies, or sensitive skin; this occurrence is extremely bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this moisturizer daily, morning and night after I washed my face (with the Oil-Free Neutrogena acne wash or One Step complete makeup removal by Neutrogena), before I&#x27;d put on a primer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews before I bought it, seemed like most people were happy with it. Nope, It&#x27;s going in the garbage. It smells kinda like a bottle of vitamins. I was drawn to it because I liked the sound of what it had in it and thought my skin could absorb some additional nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with the L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Glow Renewal. Love it so much more; smells so much better--like a mild Victoria Secret fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and the way it feels on my skin...still waiting for results and hopefully will see some changes.  Not expecting a miracle but would like to see subtle changes in fine lines and dark spots.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The customer service I have received has been perfect. I still apply serum before this , and another lotion after because I have very dry skin. I love the way it has made my skin feel and look. It makes my face look more youthful.</li>
    <li> I can see an improvement in the dark spots under eyes and on nose within only a week&#x27;s use.  Does not irritate skin, as I have sensitive skin and will break out easily.  Hope to continue to observe improvement.  So far I am pleased with this product.  Did not give a 5 because I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see an outstanding improvement.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary for testing purposes and I have to say this is such a great product. it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh smells and it absorbs nicely into my skin. I use it on my neck chest and arms as well. If you have sensitive skin like I do then this will work really well for you. It has helped to relieve my rosacea and diminish the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Absorbs well and I use it with the vitamin C serum.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> My moisturizer arrived with exploded product inside the cap. I gave it a fair shake though...because I love InstaNaturals Vitamin C Serum. Not loving this moisturizer though. It almost feels like it&#x27;s drying out my face. Doesn&#x27;t seem to add any benefits.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It was thick enough to use as hand cream but light enough that I didn&#x27;t feel it was too heavy for my face. I  love that InstaNatural creams are always packaged in a convenient pump so I can dispense just the amount that I want to use.  I could tell that it was working because it provided a slight tingle once applied and smells of citrus.  This moisturizer contains 20% Vitamin C which is supposed to help protect skin from sun damage and to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The other ingredients like Niacinamide are supposed to help with dark spots and blotchy skin. I feel that with long term use of this product I will see some improvement on my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of InstaNatural products because they don&#x27;t contain parabens, sulfates or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a free sample of this product for review purposes; these are my honest and unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing. It only takes a small amount and spreads very nicely. It contains a very nice combination of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The container also had a great built in pump that let&#x27;s you control how much you want.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on my self.......This  moisturizer feels great on my face and neck&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Great product will but again not greasy</li>
    <li> This cream is fairly thick, well thicker than I expected. I notice a more even skin tone, that is not necessary getting lighter but more balanced. I also use a cleanser, moisturizer, occasional facial and well balanced nutrition.</li>
    <li> GREAT MOISTURIZER. Came fast. Thank you</li>
    <li> I really like the cream and I believe it is evening out the face skin tones and reducing brown spots.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks, so I need to&lt;br /&gt;give it two more weeks!</li>
    <li> Works better then I ever imagined very satisfied it even helped clear up adult acne breakout I also use vitamin c serum with it, great product !</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have sensative skin, so I&#x27;m very particular about what I use. I can really tell the difference from days I do not use this product from the days I do use it. My skin does actually feel more hydrated and refreshed when I use it.</li>
    <li> It is sticky until it has been on a while. I don&#x27;t like that part but it is good later.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and feels light. No problems and my skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum I&#x27;ve bought from your company. But the moisturizer--not sure I like it so much. I apply it before go to sleep and in the morning when I wash my face I feel thin layer of this moisturizer like a film on my face.Not sure it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer, absorbs quickly. Hasn&#x27;t broken me out or made me oily. I have combo skin.This Company sent this to me to review</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this particular moisturizer.  Thus far, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  The only drawback I have found is that it does not seem to absorb into my skin as quickly as some other, similar products.  If you aren&#x27;t in a rush to moisturize and move on to makeup application, that aspect should not prove problematic.  If my opinion should change, I&#x27;ll add to this review.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer ever.  Softens without leaving skin greasy.  I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Hopefully I look youger now....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy i got this product for free to test out and review..I did my homework on this product and I really love it and I&#x27;m an huge fan of instanatural products anyway I own several and all of them are awesome. I got this vitamin c to help maintain my healty and beautiful skin. Vitamin C serum is great for my skin it leaves it skilly to the touch and moisturise. This is by far one the best quality moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used! 5 stars for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about a month and I absolutely love it. It is part of my everyday moisturizing routine and I think it&#x27;s definitely made me look younger and fresher faced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week, but it makes my skin feel softer and smoother.  The best thing is that it is very light and absorbs instantly.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Product provided for free for testing purposes.\\&quot; I love instanatural&#x27;s product line, but I don&#x27;t think I would be repurchasing this one. I let my mom who is in her 50s with dry skin and sun damage use this product. She complained that it was too drying and didn&#x27;t use it again. She prefers argan oil. As for me. I am in my 20s with combination skin, acne scarring and large pores. I find that this makes a good nighttime moisturizer and a good body moisturizer, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for the day time. When I use this at night I wake up in the morning with nice moisturized skin. When I use on on my body which has normal skin it works well as well. It leaves my body skin feeling moisturized without any greasy residue. I have a slightly dark patch on the back of one of my hands because I have a bad habit of putting the back of my hand on the chair to balance myself as I sit. This lotion seems to have lighten that patch a bit. I think I will finish using this product more as a body lotion. When I use this on my skin in the daytime, it seems to bring the redness out and it doesn&#x27;t go away for a while.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE InstaNatural fan, LOVE their products!  InstaNatural sent me this Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer to review for my blog, GlamRiver and it&#x27;s just another fantastic product to add to the growing list!  I test out A LOT of products and I am always impressed with InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight, absorbs really quickly and moisturizes all day.  It&#x27;s also a multi-tasking product because you can use it everywhere!  Plus, I like to use it with their Vitamin C serum for an extra Vitamin C boost!&lt;br /&gt;I have had great results so far and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Finally, a cream that is non-greasy and relieves the dry feeling after washing face or shower.  I can use it with other products well also and it doesn&#x27;t seem to come off on my hair or clothes when I give it a few minutes to absorb.  It is fresh and light for my sensitive and dry facial skin and my wrists.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> I included me comment for this product with the Retinol Moisturizer</li>
    <li> I got an amazing opportunity to try out this product, first of all based on extensive dermatologically based research i can say that the ingredients in this product are all what you can ask for to give you healthy youthful skin, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, plant stem cell, organic green tea, shea butter, jojoba oil.  I had used a lot of insta naturals products and i am a fan,  all organic natural skin care products had helped me a lot to revive my skin, i used the vitamin c serum the hyaluronic acid serum and my skin is so much brighter, my complexion is evened out, it does take a while in order to see results but with skin care you have to be patient, now for this moisturizer it is so creamy and soft it takes a few seconds to absorb so it is not recommended right before you apply your sunscreen or BB cream you should give it a minute or so, the other thing i had noticed is that it is a little drying and that is because of the acetyl alcohol so i started using the insta naturals argon oil ( which is another amazing product) or any other skin oil after the moisturizer for few days then it is not that drying any more, i feel like it really softens my skin giving it a healthy glow, i really like this product and i think i will continue to use it to keep my skin healthy and youthful.</li>
    <li> InstaNaturals is my new favorite. I was chosen to purchase the Vitamin C Moisturizer along with the Vitamin C Serum in order to help with my dull skin tone and tired over all appearance.  After a patch test I started applying the Vitamin C Moisturizer regularly. It has a pleasant smell that fades away but is there just long enough to remind you that you are doing something good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light weight moisturizer that applies very evenly. Currently I am using this as a day moisturizer but once it warms up I&#x27;ll probably switch to both a day and night moisturizer. I&#x27;m very happy with this moisturizer and I plan to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference from any other moisturizer</li>
    <li> This cream kept my face moisturized and acne free. It was a win win.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> It initially burned my skin and I didn&#x27;t use it for a week.  I tried it again the next  week and it has made my skin visibly smoother. It is a little harsh with smooth skin so use a little bit.</li>
    <li> Let me start off with I was chosen to try this product for free for my unbiased opinion. It&#x27;s texture is between a serum and a cream, it doesn&#x27;t soak in immediately, takes a few seconds. I just keep rubbing it in until Iknow longer see it, then feels nice and hydrated. It has some fantastic ingredients, some natural and some organic. Plus it is 3.4 oz, which most lotions are 1 oz. Price is great, I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on different skincare lines and for the price and the great ingredients, this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> excellent  product  did not irritate my sensitive skin  help to relieve some of my dry winter skin this winter  product provided for free testing purposes</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural skin products! This is no exception</li>
    <li> Love the product! Will be reordering,also wil be checking other items in this line! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have really loved using this with the serum. I was skeptical at first - my skin is pretty sensitive; but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or break me out. It is a nice, light moisturizer that works well under my BB cream.  I highly recommend this moisturizer!  **Product provided for free for testing purposes.**</li>
    <li> this works so easily. it makes skin smooth.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on very smooth and keeps my face every moisturized, I use it after my instanatural facial toner.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Works very well!</li>
    <li> I still have puffiness under the eyes.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, leaves face feeling refreshed</li>
    <li> Used in combination with the Skin Clearing Serum and it greatly reduced my acne scars.</li>
    <li> I just got this in and I will tell you, it is wonderful on my feet and especially on my heels. You pump it out and one push of the pump was enough to cover my big ol&#x27; size 10 feet! I also put some on my hands and it soaked right in and there was no scent. My feet and hands feel so much softer.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is very moisturizing. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I use this creamy moisturizer during the day under sunscreen and makeup.  It feels so good on my skin and the pump works beautifully.  My skin definitely feels and looks younger.</li>
    <li> I thought this was too greasy to be a facial moisturizer. I ended up breaking out from using it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer absorbs pretty quickly into my skin making my skin feel soft and the fine lines are not as noticeable . I especially like that a little bit goes a long way so this container should last me a long time. I received a free sample of this product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light moisturizing cream. Not oily-feeling at all. Although it does have some oil in it for moisturizing, you don&#x27;t feel it. It dries quickly, which I like. It leaves a matte finish on my face and very toned.</li>
    <li> I love it so far.  Been using the product for almost a month and it does make my skin feel soft and hydrated but I used the retinol under that and the serum under that.  Still waiting for the day my 50 year old skin turns into a 30 year olds&#x27;. (Have given up on the 20 something skin..not working). :)</li>
    <li> Love the moisturizing and face lifting this product provides.  A great under makeup cream just wait a few minutes after applying before putting on makeup.  I will definitely be repurchasing this cream.  I use it twice a day.  A little goes a long way.  Have tried other creams find this the best one!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great, it absorbs quickly and makes your pores look small. It&#x27;s not oily at all so it&#x27;s great for summer.</li>
    <li> I love how moisturizing this is. The skin on my forehead gets really dry and flaky. With in just a few days of using this, it was cleared up. You only need to use a little as it goes a long way. I love how light this feels on your skin and that it does not leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. The scent is very light and actually a quite pleasant citrus scent (obviously). I highly recommend this for everyone to use to moisturize without damage!

    <li> I grew up in New York but moved to the south a few years ago, and the change in climate was startling to say the least. As a northerner, you hear the stories of the intensely hot summers but you don&#x27;t actually understand the pain until you&#x27;re sweating from places you didn&#x27;t know sweat could be produced. I&#x27;m in my late 20s but I&#x27;m trying to be proactive about the health of my skin, especially my face, and I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C for a while now to counteract some of the negatives of the skin-drying conditions here. I&#x27;ve used this product on my face and around my eyes, and although I have combination/oily skin, I&#x27;ve found it does not leave me feeling greasy at all. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause me to break out. Great cream if you&#x27;re looking for anti-aging properties, if you&#x27;re looking for preventative skin products or simply a really good moisturizer to use under makeup or on its own.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely moisturizer, packed with all the right ingredients, like vitamins and powerful antioxidants, and none of the wrong ones. I like the fact that it has no smell, and I appreciate the packaging - the airtight pump that protects the lotion from air and light exposure, thus preventing loss of ingredient potency and cross-contamination. However, it&#x27;s not that moisturizing - it has super light texture, absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin dry. To me it acts more like a serum, rather than a moisturizer. Another downside that it has no SPF. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I live in dry and sunny Colorado, and I need my moisturizer to be a little more emollient and have a sunscreen. This cream could be a better fit for someone who lives in humid climate and uses it at night. Other than that, it&#x27;s a very decent, great quality skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Product was provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Feels lightweight and smooth. I have noticed a difference in the feel and tone of my skin. I&#x27;ve used this for two weeks. This moisturizer is not greasy and it does not clog your pores. I love the ingredients of this moisturizer.    \\&quot;Product provided for free for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Was looking for something a little more hydrating for these dry winter days and I found it with this product.  I only buy InstaNatural, so I was thrilled to see them offering this new product.  I&#x27;ve always used the serums, but this winter my skin needed a little extra hydration.  I&#x27;ve also used the Hyaluronic Acid Serum in conjunction with this product and the new Youth Express Eye Serum.  In love with this combo....I WILL SURVIVE THIS WINTER!  Thank you InstaNatural for always using the best/proven ingredients!  I have SUPER sensitive skin and everything I get from InstaNatural agrees with my skin completely.  Products absorb completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural is a great company that cares about their customers....will continue buying their products.</li>
    <li> JUST LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER!  IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day and I love it!  In the morning I apply it all over my skin, and allows my makeup to go on flawlessly.  At night I use the moisturizer and then follow up with the vitamin c serum!  I love that this company does not test on animals and uses the finest ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product free for review purposes, however I was not asked to leave a positive review.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I have tried so many throughout the years and had pretty much given up when I read about this stuff online.  At the time, I was having major skin problems for some unknown reason--horrible acne on strange areas of my face that just would not go away.  I gave this product a whirl (along with Instanatural toner, serum and night cream), and not only did my acne go away pronto, my skin has NEVER looked better.  It really does help with scarring, too.  Also, I used to wake up every morning with my face feeling horribly dry, but now, post-Instanatural, it always feels moisturized.  Big deal for me.  This stuff is absolutely wonderful, as is every other Instanatural product I have tried.  The company even e-mails you instructions on how to use the products for best results and follows up with you later to make sure you&#x27;re happy.  Great product, great company...I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer in combination with the Vitamin C serum for about two weeks, and I&#x27;m pleased with both products so far. Although the serum has a lovely citrus-y scent, the moisturizer does not, but the smell of the moisturizer isn&#x27;t bad. Also, while the serum absorbs very quickly, the moisturizer requires a little more time (maybe half a minute or so) and effort (some extra circular motions and patting with my fingertips) before it is absorbed. At first I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t giving the serum enough time to dry before I applied the moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how long I wait in between applying the two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels softer and smoother when I use these products, and I think they&#x27;re at least as good as other similar products I&#x27;ve tried. As to whether they&#x27;re helping to prevent or reverse signs of aging, I can&#x27;t say. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks, and I don&#x27;t really see any difference, but I wouldn&#x27;t really expect to so quickly. One very good thing I can say is that I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my face breaking out since I&#x27;ve been using these products, and I have sensitive skin in that regard. I&#x27;m always leery of trying anything new for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell that I&#x27;m going to use up the bottle of serum much more quickly than the moisturizer (which is in a good-sized container for the price, as compared with other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used) ... so if you&#x27;re like me and you plan to use the two products together, you will most likely be ordering the serum more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this company&#x27;s products are all vegan (with the exception of the emu oil) makes me feel good about using them, and the company seems eager to make sure customers are pleased with its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have anything else to report as I continue to use these products, I&#x27;ll update this review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and very dry skin with some skin discoloration left behind from acne. Surprisingly I found this to work better than their Niacinamide cream for everyday use. Niacinamide cream seemed to easily clog my small pores and cause some acne on my acne prone skin; this cream didn&#x27;t seem to do that. It moisturizes well even on dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable scent. The next day after use I noticed a big difference not only did I notice my skin to be brighter but also a great difference in texture, it felt noticeably smoother and softer, after 2 wk use I notice a slight lightening on my hyper-pigmentation. I tried using this along side the Vitamin C serum and didn&#x27;t find it enhanced this moisturizer&#x27;s effects. I prefer just using the moisturizer. I would (re)purchase this moisturizer over the Niacinamide cream, or the VItamin C serum.  *Product provided for free for testing purposes*</li>
    <li> Works as well as much more expense creams for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Love this product only thing is I wish it wasn&#x27;t so oily but I use it everyday here in Florida.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. InstaNatural products are now my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I have not used this a lot as yet.  Appears to be good and feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> Non-Irritating, absorbs well and is making progress on an annoying age spot I am too young to have! (Yes, checked with dermatologist to be sure.) This product should be a go-to basic for any skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I am forty two and I have been using facial care products since I was twenty eight and honestly this is the best skincare product I ever had thank you</li>
    <li> My skin feels more smooth and supple, haven&#x27;t seen any change in skin tone or wrinkles yet, but it does feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Shipping was on time, so far this cream is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.  The moisture will last all day. Great product  I like it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product. I try so many different moisturizers, and rarely notice any difference, but not with this. Love it, thanks!!</li>
    <li> My skin has shown a great deal of improvement since using this moisturizer. It&#x27;s smoother more softer and healthy looking. I absolutly love this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the vit c serum.  Together they are perfect.  The serum is so smooth and gentle you can even use it under and around your eyes.  This moisturizer absorbs well and is not greasy.  My skin looks and feels much better after a couple of weeks regular use in the mornings.  I use the retinol pair at night.  Excellent product at a great price.  I used to use Estee Lauder at a very costly price and these products work better for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> This cream is great!  It gives you deep moisturization without feeling heavy and making you break out.  I use two pumps and cover my face and neck before putting on my makeup.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ... I will buy it again ...</li>
    <li> Just okay....didn&#x27;t go on smooth and my skin felt sticky.  Didn&#x27;t feel like a day cream, returning.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. It leaves your face so soft and alittle goes along ways.  I can already see the fine lines disappearing.  I have tried several Instanatural products and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this gets such rave reviews. Are they compensated? It doesn&#x27;t feel hydrating, and leaves a film over the face. I&#x27;ve seen no positive difference in the appearance of my skin after using it for two months. It also clogs my pores. The price would be great for a serviceable moisturizer - sadly, this isn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the citrus smell of this stuff. Leaves my skin hydrated but not oily.</li>
    <li> Works very well on people with non-sensitive skin. I saw results in the first week with appropriate hydration intake  (8 glasses of water a day). Highly recommended, specially  if you intend to hydrate yourselves appropriately.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  I stopped using it because I was having bumps on my face.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t react well. Always felt like my face was on fire!</li>
    <li> i am going to try this for a few months it leaves sorta tacky feel have not seen any results yet and its been a month</li>
    <li> Love love love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Cream is awesome! I use it day and night, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, there isn&#x27;t any kind of smell that I can detect. I have been using it for over a week and my skin is starting to look better, brighter and clearer. Also, this product is very rich therefore just a little will go a long way!</li>
    <li> Never used a moisturizer until now, my dermatologist suggested one with vitamin C for my skin type and I decided to order from InstaNatural. The texture is amazing, so smooth, and you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing a moisturizer, which works if you plan on wearing it under make-up (I don&#x27;t wear make-up often, but it&#x27;s nice to know this can be done). My face got a bit red on the cheeks for the first two days, but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for three weeks now and haven&#x27;t encountered any redness at all. It was probably a reaction to cold weather as I&#x27;m not used to it. My skin looks healthier somehow, and some marks have vanished (although bear in mind this is my first time using a moisturizer, it might just be what my skin needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely buying again and keep on using it. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ripped open the box and immediately put this on my clean face. Wore it for a few hours then had to wipe it off with toner before I could do my makeup. I have oily skin and this moisturizer was too thick :( I will use it as my night cream. Back to hunting for a good light day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. will buy again. It makes my face feel healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully hydrating cream that I have actually been using not on my face, but my neck and decollete area, and even my arms and legs because I&#x27;m out of my usual body lotion. I LOVE it! It is fragrance free and absorbs quickly. My skin feels nourished and looks hydrated and radiant. This has become my favorite lotion. I really like the pump packaging because it protects the product from oxidation and I know I&#x27;lll be able to easily get all of the product out, so nothing gets wasted.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer as a night cream.  I wake up with my face feeling soft and moisturized.  I have normal skin, so for me, as a day cream under makeup, it would be too thick, but perfect for nighttime.  A little goes a long way, so very price effective.  One pump is all I need of this creamy moisturizer for my whole face, neck and décolleté.  It is so rich and creamy I also use it on my hands, arms and elbows.  I have found that if I use too much, it will take longer to absorb and feel a little tacky, but I learned it only takes a little to get my desired results.  Just full of vitamins and botanicals to nourish and hydrate my aging skin, and discourage the look of my hyper pigmentation that had started to develop.  I have normal skin and have had no adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer quenched my dry skin and was not greasy. There is virtually no scent, which I really like. So far after using it a couple of weeks, I don&#x27;t see any brightening of my skinfrom the vitamin C. I like the feeling of using a moisturizer that is healthy for my skin and this seems to be just right.</li>
    <li> as this is my second bottle I love the Vit C cream for face...even using the first bottle I noticed a change in my skin</li>
    <li> A good product with the added bonus of Vitamin C. Feels great, a good quality moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy, but it adds enough moisture to my slightly dry skin. Makeup goes over it very nicely, both liquid makeup and powders. I think my skin looks smoother and healthier. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, but the first bottle lasted me at least a couple of months, a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> All you need is a tiny drop. I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I combine it with the Retinol advance action moisturizer and it works awesome. It is light and effective. I have been using it within a month and my face and neck feels great. I hope it continues firming and dissolves the wrinkles lines. I highly recommend this product of Instanatural brand you will love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silvia,&lt;br /&gt;Houston, TX</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have been using it for two weeks and already see a difference.  It has an easy applicator and absorbs into the skin.  It is neither greasy nor oily.  I really do love it!</li>
    <li> Was hoping I would love this but I do not.  Do not like the consistency and hard to rub in all the way</li>
    <li> I bought this product from their website after reading all the positive reviews here. Very disappointed! This moisturizer isn&#x27;t hydrating at all. My face felt so dry and a little burning sensation after using this. I also purchased their Retinol Moisturizer Cream and like that one so far. I would not recommend this product if you have dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> love the product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used several InstaNatural products before with great results, so I was more than happy to give their Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer a run for its money! As always, I received the product free to facilitate this review, but it does not affect my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion comes in a convenient pump style. It’s a nice wide-topped pump that dispenses plenty of product with each pump. I actually found I need only half of what it dispensed each time. It spreads very easily and goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate effect of using the moisturizer was a smooth and soft finish to my skin. I am using other products from them, including the mud mask I recently reviewed, so it’s hard to say exactly which is having the greatest effect on my skin. The product have all been working together and are overall continuing to improve the overall appearance and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to reduce my applications down to once daily… as they suggest for sensitive skin. I didn’t think my skin was very sensitive, but the lotion made my face tingle and the skin got a bit red for a few minutes after application. It was similar to the sensation of using a mild toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they offer  complete line of products that are budget-friendly and effective. I recommend exploring their offerings for many of our personal care needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smooth and creamy moisturizer. Left my skin feeling instantly soft. Worked with the other InstaNatural products to further improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Made my skin tingle and slightly red after application.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  Normally when I use new products on my face I go through a small breakout phase while my skin adjusts to it.  Didn&#x27;t happen at all with this!  That was great!  It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling or looking greasy.  And a little bit goes a long way so it lasts a long time.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Be careful, can produce some kind of allergy.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results but it feels very soft when applied.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate it. But so it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I see immediate results both morning and night after applying this cream.</li>
    <li> Amazing Quick Results. Best face cream Ive used.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Smooth and creamy and smells good. Not overly heavy but very moisturizing. Will keep using!</li>
    <li> Fabulously lightweight , but powerfully moisturizing! scent free which is a plus as some Vit C creams can be overly citrus. Goes on well both under makeup for daily use and before bed for night therapies.</li>
    <li> Youth Express Vitamin C  from Instanatural is excellent and it&#x27;s reasonably priced to use as both a facial and a body lotion.  I think it works so well because it has Hyaluronic Acid and MSM in it as well as Vitamin C so it really does help protect my skin.  I love both products that I now use from Instanatural;  they have pure ingredients and they&#x27;re basically fragrance free which is important to me as I have sensitivities to scented items.  I highly recommend any product from Instanatural - and their service is excellent as well.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is unscented and perfect for my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue, it leaves my skin nice and soft. The bottle was bigger than I thought it would be. I am thoroughly happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in February 24 and the product was delivered in a timely manner and I started using it instantly upon receipt.  I am a woman 55+ who has lost a 100+ lbs and unfortunately that loss shows on my face.  I got C serum a couple of weeks before purchasing this product and started immediately with that, then upon receipt of Vitamin C started using this cream daily.  It appears after using the product almost a month, as I long as I&#x27;m not looking in my mean magnifying X5 mirror that the tiny lines around my eyes and my smile lines around the sides of my mouth are softening.  I do know my face has gone from dry and scaly to moist and and plumper looking and has a nice new glow. I like the feel of the product, it&#x27;s not heavy, it&#x27;s nice and light and my skins drinks it in very quickly and it does not leave me oily under my make up during the day, which has always been a problem in the past for me with any type of moisturizer. I&#x27;ve looked at the InstaNatural products line and there are others I may try later. But I do like and recommend this one product.  My face does look fresher and decidedly better and I&#x27;m happy so far, but don&#x27;t expect to get rid of deep lines after loosing weight late in life when your skin has lost a lot of its resiliency and elasticity. I&#x27;m looking for a combination such as the ones Dr Oz promo&#x27;s show, which catch you with &amp;#34;free month&#x27;s supply all you pay is freight,&amp;#34; but most people miss the small print that says for 14 days and then of course they don&#x27;t tell you the 2 products are going to run $80 + each for the month!  I want to look like the 70 year old, who after multiple &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; now looks 40 - bring on some of that for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then, give this a try, it&#x27;s definitely been worth it to see my skin have a glow and softness which has been missing for the last few years.</li>
    <li> I was using a very expensive moisturizer and just thought I would give this a try.  I have normal skin and it moisturizers dry areas and keeps oiliness in check. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excited to use this based upon their other products I currently use. Two people said I looked younger-and I can only attribute this to the face products I&#x27;ve been using. Use them on my hands, too. Wish they had a face wash and toner.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Moisturizer for several weeks.  A small amount goes a long way. I love how light it feels, not heavy at all.  It helps to refine the fine lines.  I like this product very much.  Since I have been using the InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about 2 months and now added the Vitamin C Moisturizer, I have seen a reduction in spots I had on my face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several months and I just ordered my second container.  I am very pleased with this product.  I love the results and the price is great.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light and and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. The pump system is great too. Takes my complexion from dull to bright in an instant! With all the ingredients I know my skin is well moisturized and I love that!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see why it got such rave reviews -- it is nothing special, just cheap.</li>
    <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve used for half the price. I truly believe my skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> Amazing would recommend</li>
    <li> Received this product nearly free for my unbiased opinion.  Although I am grateful for the opportunity to try this product, I am sorry to say that this product is not a moisturizer.  And there is no way that I can possibly use this on 51 year old skin.  I will have to give this one to my daughter so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have investigated the ingredients better.  I say investigate since I don&#x27;t see an ingredient listing on the sale page?  The top 3 ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Aloe (95% water)&lt;br /&gt;Palm oil</li>
    <li> Have only been using this Vitamin C Moisturizer for less than a month but really do like the feel and consistency of this cream!  And a little goes a long way!  Try it...I think you&#x27;ll like it too!  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. Kind of sticky feeling on my face.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer.  I tend to have oily prone skin around my tzone area and i feel this moisturizer helps matify my entire face. It is great to use as a base before applying your makeup because it locks in moisture and hydrates the skin. Overall amazing product.  I noticed a difference in my complexion a week after using this moisturizer daily. My pores looked smaller, skin felt soft, and fine lines/wrinkles were minimized.  This is a great product for all skin types and for all ages. I&#x27;ve used a variety of moisturizers in the past such as aveeno, sephora&#x27;s instant hydration, skindinavia, mac strobe cream etc... and I find my skin has been a lot healthier after using this natural product. The ingredients are things you can understand and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very light, I let my friend with rosacea try it and she did not break out from it. So...I would say it would be great for sensitive skin as well. If you have oily or combo skin, this would work well for you. I need a little more moisture at night so I plan on buying the insta natural night cream as well. This company is wonderful to work with and I will continue to buy their products. Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Love using this moisturizer. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product. Makes her feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> i like it. i don&#x27;t use makeup but i use this.</li>
    <li> I really love the cream, but the container is horrible.  When it arrived, product had leaked into the top.  When I use the pump to get product out, it kind of oozes from twp different directions.  The company needs another container which is more effective in delivering the product and not wasting any.</li>
    <li> I love it. it smells good. after using it, my face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this Vit C Cream to my face and arms for ~ 3 weeks now.  Previously, I had  been using the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Volume Filler which I purchased over the counter.  I was happy with the L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler but after reading the Amazon reviews, I decided to try the InstaNatural moisturizer.  My face was slightly red and irritated after applying a serum and this moisturizer but these issues subsided with continued use.  This moisturizer does a good job of keeping my face and arms hydrated.  After my purchase, I received an email from InstaNatural with instructions  on its use and thanking me for my purchase. Wonderful product and excellent service!</li>
    <li> I have terrible dry skin on my forehead and nose and this moisturizer is really helping keep that under control.  It is light on your skin, not greasy or oily, and absorbs quickly.  It has no fragrance either, so no worries about irritating sensitive skin.  I use this in the morning under my makeup and InstaNatural&#x27;s Retinal Serum at night and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light enough for day time wear. Does not leave skin stick or oily. I truly enjoy all of the InstaNaturals products that I have tried!! I use this one for day and the Night Cream Moisturizer before bed. It makes for a great skin care combination.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure this is producing the results Vernal Moisturizing Cream offers, but it seems to be pretty close,  so I will continue, and add to this review in another month!</li>
    <li> It smelled terrible and felt like a layer of grease on my face. I bought the drops from the same company before and really liked them and figured to try the moisturizer too. But this product is not for me.It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling soft. It was sticky and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my face. It is NOT absorbent. Feels like heavy make-up.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks still waiting for some positive results</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer definitely recommend to buy. After a few days using it my face i can feel the difference. My face is much softer and brighter.  Love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but feels like it&#x27;s clogging my pores and sometimes makes my face feel sweaty.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a moisturizer that suits my skin. A moisturizer that is light weight, fragrance-free, and does not make me break out. I honestly believe that this product is helping my acne. I have only been using this product for less than a month and I already see my face clearing up. I definitely would purchase this moisturizer again.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I always study the ingredient list of any product I use on my skin, and this wonderful, lightweight, fragrance-free moisturizer is packed with very impressive and mostly organic natural ingredients. A lot of thoughtful research has gone into creating this product. It is generously sized at 3.4 oz (100ml). The moisturizer has a smooth, light texture. Since I have dry skin, I mix a little bit of rosehip oil in it, and smooth it on my skin. It absorbs well, and works great under make-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> First off, the packaging is very nice, and shipment was fast. I really like this cream, it&#x27;s not too thick &amp; not too thin, just right. It feels like it moisturizes well, makes my skin feel soft and more vibrant looking. It really has no scent at all, which I like, too. During the cold, dry winter months, I mix a couple drops of Insta-Natural&#x27;s Argon Oil with it, and it moisturizes better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past &amp; lasts all day or night. Great product, I will purchase again. (Product provided for free for testing purposes)</li>
    <li> For the price this is a very nice moisturizer.  I use it in conjunction with their vitamin C serum and my skin is noticeably more hydrated.</li>
    <li> great product, helped fade dark spots and acne.</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizer, It is great for after you wash your face. I did not like that the lotion is hard to run in. It takes awhile to get it into your skin. There is a light smell to it, but not completely order less. I am not sure I would get this again, but I use it everyday to keep my face moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month.  I do feel that my skin lifted and smooth.  I love it a lot.  No more expensive products for me.  In fact I ordered InstaNatural products again.</li>
    <li> My mom gave this cream to me as a bday gift when I turned 30 and it has been working well! It&#x27;s soft and refreshing. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This may sound a little overindulgent but I specifically ordered this product for my neck,, chest and arms, which are very and dry sun damaged. I&#x27;m very happy with my facial routine and products, but all the body lotions that I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t seem strong enough to tackle the multiple problems that sun damage has caused to my neck, chest, and arms, and to use my current facial products there is just far too cost prohibitive. This product comes at a decent price and in a decent enough size container that it was worth giving it a try The initial ingredients that I was aware of when I was first purchasing it, which were vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and organic jojoba oil, are also in my facial products, which works great for me so I figured I would get at least some benefit from it on my body as well. What I didn&#x27;t know until the product arrived was that it contains all these other amazing ingredients as well. It also contains organic aloe vera gel, palm oil, glycerin, organic safflower oil, plant stem cells, undaria pinnatifida cell culture extract, shea butter, vitamin b5 (panthenol), organic gotu kola, wild crafted horsetail, wild crafted dandelion, wild geranium, and organic green tea.  Being a nurse practitioner I have seen several of these ingredients on some of our new burn dressings used on some of the more severe burns to speed up cellular turnover and regeneration. I don&#x27;t know why the company isn&#x27;t including these ingredients on the main label, since they really should be taking credit for them being included in the product. Anyway as soon as I received the product I immediately began applying it to my neck and chest and both upper and lower arms twice a day and saw an almost immediate improvement within 3 to 5 days. Even the areas of my forearms that had been leather like to do to years of exposure to the sun from playing sports and sun worshiping had become softer and more supple. The color on my chest is becoming less stippled and spotted and more uniform and I&#x27;m starting to see healthier, brighter skin develop. The dryness has completely disappeared. It&#x27;s only been about two weeks now and I have seen a dramatic change in the overall appearance, texture and feel to my skin in all the areas I&#x27;ve been using it. And I was definitely comforted by the fact that I&#x27;m not going to go through the product quickly, as I&#x27;ve not even used up a quarter of the bottle yet. I expect this one bottle to last me about 6 to 8 weeks. Not bad when covering such a large body percentage.  I wish I had one of those cameras that allows you to take pictures of the damage underneath your skin to see if I was making any difference to the actual dermis, but at least I know I&#x27;m making a definite difference to the skin  that I can see and feel, and it looks and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Using Retinol Serum, Vit. C Serum, Retinol Moisturizer, Vit. C Moisturizer, Age Defying Moisturizer and Eye Cream.  I interchanged these every two or three days and am seeing softer, smoother skin.  I&#x27;ve been using these for over a month now.</li>
    <li> I really like this for my neck and chest areas.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it did make me break out a little on my face.  I would like to use it on my face because it did make a noticeable difference on my chest.  It helped with sun spots and made my skin look smoother.</li>
    <li> Definitely love this moisturizer!  It includes my so-far favorite ingredients of Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid.  I can say that this is much lighter and creamier than I thought it would be, it&#x27;s great for those of us that cringe of putting anything &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; on our faces.  I don&#x27;t get any irritation from it, just silky smooth skin without the weighted-down feeling of other products, and I&#x27;m definitely relating that to the all natural aspect of this product.  I can go from blotchy tired puffy looking right after waking up to doing my regimine of wash, toner, serum and moisturizer and look and FEEL 10 years younger.  I know it sounds cliche, but even my neighbors are noticing!  Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion texture. Just wish it had sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> This is my third order.  This cream is light, feels good and has really helped my skin.  I&#x27;ve spent much, much more on other products, none of them was any better than this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I believe I&#x27;ve found a new favorite moisturizer! My skin tends to be really sensitive and this not only calms down that sensitivity by helps to decrease break outs. The ingredients are top notch, natural, and without weird synthetic s*%t that is harmful to the skin. I am also impressed that it can be both very moisturizing AND not oily. Actually leaves my skin feeling very clean even in my T-zone which tends to get oily by the end of the day. And also just have to say that after sampling LOTS of different natural facial products over the past few months, InstaNatural wins hands down with AMAZING customer service. If there is an issue, they will happily fix it with a quick email.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c cream it works great under makeup does not leave the skin oily I would recommend this moisturizer for everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the last thing I apply on my face in the morning, and leaves my face soft and moisturized throughout the day. Would recommend, and great vitamins without the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> After application, my skin feels sticky.  I have oily skin so this doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product! She has ordered a lot from this company and loves all of it. The customer service is SECOND TO NONE!</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is white and smooth and glides on easily. It has a rich, creamy consistency that is not greasy or sticky. It is unscented. A little goes a long ways. I am using this twice a day, in the morning and at night. Product provided for free for testing purposes. Update: 3/11/16 I absolutely love this moisturizer after using this daily for a year. The reason it has lasted is that I was using a few other products along with this. Now I&#x27;m exclusively using it in my morning regimen after I apply serum. It is lightweight and not creamy and thick light night creams or retinol creams. The ingredients are awesome: Vitamin C powerhouse antioxidant, hyaluronic acid to hold moisture and produce plumper skin and reduce fine lines, and Niacinamide (B3) to reduce discoloration and pigmentation, plant stem cells and peptide complex to fortify against the signs of aging. I do notice a nice smooth glow and fewer fine lines around my eyes and forehead and mouth. I&#x27;ve always had lots of freckles which darken with the sun&#x27;s UV rays so the niacinamide has helped decrease the pigmentation and has brightened my skin. My face looks younger now than ever, and I am in my mid forties. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for use at night or after doing a peel.</li>
    <li> Currently this is my favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> im quite skeptical about this moisturizer, it neither moisturize my skin nor it lighting. it hate it&#x27;s smell, although it is not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;Im going to continue using it in hope it takes longer to show results.</li>
    <li> As with the night cream this vitamin c moisturizer is everything !. I am looking forward to using other products from this line  to help me with my journey to getting my skin to the point where I don&#x27;t need to wear makeup</li>
    <li> This product is great and the cost is reasonable, I will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, easy spreading, light and non oily.</li>
    <li> love it. my face is smooth and it helps for my dry skin...I have allergy for the face product but this is not ...</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face every night.  Skin is much more dewy and brighter.</li>
    <li> I love love love this moisturiser&lt;br /&gt;Ever since i have started using it, i have seen changes in the texture of my skin&lt;br /&gt;I have severe dry skin but this miracle cream removed the flakyness in first application&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend this to all :)&lt;br /&gt;I have used the moisturiser here you can check out&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/M6JI8RiVxXU</li>
    <li> I will be buying this again.  I like how smooth it is goes on and my face is looking better the more I have used it.</li>
    <li> Great product prompt service</li>
    <li> It work and very happy, will buy again</li>
    <li> It seems to be working nicely</li>
    <li> I was using it once a day. Product didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the regular Neutrogena products in the store. The area just below my eyes got really dry. It&#x27;s expensive and useless.</li>
    <li> Like it makes my face feel soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this Vitamin C Moisturizer. It went on extremely smooth and soaked into my skin instantly. I even used a little bit of it on my knuckles. I had super dry skin there from the harsh winter, and it restored my hands!! This didn&#x27;t make my face feel oily/greasy or dry! Which makes me love it even more! Usually facial lotions will make my face feel gross, like I rubbed grease all over it. I was given this product for testing purposes, these are my honest opinions, though!!</li>
    <li> Every single product i have ordered from InstaNatural has been simply Amazing! I really Love this brand and item.</li>
    <li> A bit pricy but it really worth it!</li>
    <li> I was excited about receiving this moisturizer, but my fave starting breaking out.  I had to stop using it.  I did like the feel and texture though.  Wish I could use it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes however it wont make your face greasy</li>
    <li> this is another product I was given to review and again this company does not disappoint. great shipping and this will leave you face neck or where ever you choose to use it feeling so smooth and soft. works well  and didn&#x27;t wash of when i went swimming like most do.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was the 20% vitamin c moisturizer in a different bottle/box. It is not the same moisturizer. I think it might be a pretty good moisturizer and have only used it twice but the smell is repellant to me. It smells like sweet urine. Yuck. So much for $20 wasted. Now i know Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Skin Lotion just has a different name. A little consistency would be great on the company&#x27;s part.</li>
    <li> Do not like,too sticky on the skin.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this!</li>
    <li> My face feels amazing.... Love the fast results.</li>
    <li> Hi sorry it took so long to respond. My skin seems to be tolerating it pretty well. I mix it with my eye gel just to dilute it a bit at night. So far so good. The eye gel is awesome! It&#x27;s light and smooth on the skin. I also have the vitamin C serum which seems alright except I don&#x27;t care for how sticky/ tacky it feels on my skin, however it has not irritated my skin so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is outstanding! I love that it has Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid it as they work very well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this moisturizer! It&#x27;s so smooth and goes on light, but is deeply moisturizing!  The InstaNatural brand is quickly becoming my favorite beauty brand!  They use only the highest quality ingredients, and in this particular product: plant stem cells, peptide complex, msm, hylauronic acid, niacinamide, vitamin c, and a plethora of organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;A big dose of antioxidants is always a good idea, especially with summer quickly approaching--which will help combat the effect of sun exposure and UV rays.  The complex in this moisturizer will work together to reduce the appearance of signs of aging; wrinkles, age spots and discoloration, as well as dryness.  Sign me up! :)</li>
    <li> Not sure of the benefit because I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin(after application it feels like like a gel on my face and once it dries I feel it tightens) so I&#x27;m not using it. I have normal skin.</li>
    <li> Between using a wonderful quality Vitamin C cream like this one and using retinol A, my skin looks healthy and vibrant, which I never thought would happen in my late 40&#x27;s!  This is science and not just hype..dish most of your drug store crap and go for the products that are Proven to work!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product line and very pleased with results so far.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I use it with a vitamin C serum and i love this moisturizer. My skin feels great, this absorbs quickly leaves no residue. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have this product for about 3 wks now and I can already see it brightening.. I will keep using it and post before and after pics</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer.  Filled with all the yummy ingredients your skin craves. My husband&#x27;s skin was looking dry with fine lines and wrinkles. So I got him in the habit of applying it in the AM and PM.  Friends and family have noticed a huge difference in his skin!  Try it,  you will not be dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> smell bad, other wise its okay</li>
    <li> No benefit from using it!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty high priced and I didn&#x27;t notice any real moisturizing effect. I always had to use moisturizing cream to really soften the skin after using this product.&lt;br /&gt; Just a side note. Since vitamin C is one of the cheapest vitamins there is, I don&#x27;t understand the excessive prices that these creams and lotions command. I feel this product is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt; My solution was to buy pure Rose Hip Oil from Amazon, apply that first, and Then put my favorite sunscreen moisturizing lotion over it. Much more economical and  I get great results. Age spots are gone and my hands feel great.</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer but it&#x27;s also brightening. I really like to use this after a mask or exfoliating or in conjunction with my spf and bb cream. It&#x27;s light enough to wear with foundation, too. I have had no issues using this moisturizer on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me oily.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the winter.  This cream has helped a lot.  My skin is much softer and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, but a little pricey. I really like the feel of it on my face. I&#x27;ve been using this a couple of weeks now, and I don&#x27;t notice any dramatic change. I would still recommend it as a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> If any of you have tried meaningful beauty, this moisturizer works just as good, if not better and it&#x27;s 1/3 of the price. Love this product and how it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Does not clog my pores. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer! This moisturizer is very creamy in texture it spreads nicely on the skin and soaks in right away rather than sitting on top of your skin,which can be so annoying especially when you wear makeup. It does not leave your face greasy or shiny! I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer, smoother and brighter! I love this cream :)</li>
    <li> great moisturizer.  a little sticky at first but absorbs quickly.  I use only at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this moisturizer for a few days, but wanted to go ahead and share my experience so far. The texture of this moisturizer is pretty nice, but as it&#x27;s absorbing into the skin, it feels more like a serum than moisturizer. You may notice a bit of a sticky feeling until it fully dries. I don&#x27;t think this product is as moisturizing as I expected or need (I have combination skin), so after only a few days, I&#x27;m noticing tiny little bumps on my forehead that would normally appear when I use a product that is too drying or doesn&#x27;t provide adequate moisture to my skin. While I do notice somewhat of a glow to my face throughout the day, this moisturizer just isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I&#x27;d hoped. I may continue to use this on humid days or perhaps under a product that provides more moisture. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this product for too long but so far I am very happy with it. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with the greasy feeling or shiny look like most moisturizers do. I would and have recommend it to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Received on time, works well on my face after I shave</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! I use it rite after the Vitamin C Cleanser and they both go great together. This Moisturizer has evened out my complextion, left me with a nice glow on me skin &amp; definitelty reduced my acne. My skin feels very smooth and quenched after I apply this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Moisturizer. I stumbled upon this product not too long ago and have since bought 2 bottles. Soon to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and find this Vitamin C cream an excellent face moisturizer. It dries nicely and is not at all greasy. It has no fragrance and one bottle lasts quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;This cream does not have SPF sun protection but I put on my sunscreen first, then the Vitamin C cream. This provides very good protection for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this at night too.&lt;br /&gt;It is non-irritating, gentle and smooths on wonderfully. It is safe enough to put around the eyes and I have also applied it to my arms.&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C cream is a very good choice as an all around moisturizer that is gentle and effective. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the product.  I went back to my old suplier. One the lid doesn&#x27;t seal the product.  It&#x27;s too thin a cream. Just not impressed. Sorry</li>
    <li> Skin seems to look much healthier after only a few uses!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency of this moisturizer and how it feels on my skin - it is thick without feeling heavy. I have oily skin but this has helped to control it. Sometimes my skin can be sensitive to new products but I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions at all with this product - in fact my skin looks healthier than ever. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this serum because it gives my skin that soft feeling and it looks revived the next morning!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural is my new go-to for ALL skin care.  This is what we all need for our skin.</li>
    <li> I will never buy any other vitamin C moisturizer, this stuff is great!  My face feels soft and smooth. I mix it with their Retinol Moisturizer Cream and Youth Express Night Cream and the combination has given me glowing skin. A wonderful complement to their serums!</li>
    <li> Not meant for oily skin</li>
    <li> was a good moisturizer but it may cause break outs! got terrible acne whenever I used this product. Test it out and see what happens.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing I have only used it for a week and can already tell the difference. This is a product I will keep on my shelf!</li>
    <li> The cream leaves my face feeling dry and irritated and then I break out - I&#x27;ve tried using it for 2 months to see if my face just needed time to get used to it but nothing. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and went back to my old cream but disappointed this one didn&#x27;t work out. Friend who uses InstaNatural products warned me about this one - he uses another product that seems to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone...</li>
    <li> So lightweight and my skin feels soft after application</li>
    <li> They send courtesy emails and the product works really well.  Like it more than the Clinique surprisingly.  Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel, good company to support!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would even out the color of my skin and this product did the job. I used this product twice daily per the instructions and I am very pleased with the results.  My skin tone appears brighter and the blotchiness has disappeared.</li>
    <li> I love all the moisturizers from this company they never make me breakout and keep my skin super hydrated. 4 stars because it has almost no smell but its odd the way it smells</li>
    <li> After falling in love with Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Toner, I was really excited to give the moisturizer a try. This moisturizer is a thinner consistency, but still provides a lot of moisture. I like that it includes Niaminicide, Plant Stem Cells, and Peptides. I have some issues with splotchy skin, especially on my cheeks, and have found that the overall appearance of my skin seems to be improving with continued use. I&#x27;ve also used this on my hands and arms for a little extra moisture. Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> No difference since i&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is not greasy when applied to my face &amp; neck area.  I loved it so much I gave my daughter in law one &amp; also my niece.  I am waiting to hear if they like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Just ok...I see no noticeable difference. It doesn&#x27;t add as much moisture as I would like, it feels a bit drying.</li>
    <li> I did not request return.</li>
    <li> I love all of insta naturals product lines and I had the opportunity to receive this product as a gift for my review. It is wonderful it has a nice creamy texture too it but doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue after you apply it.  I use this on my cracked feet and hands and it does wonders on healing them along with keeping them moisturized. It is very soothing and soft and love how it is all organic and no added chemicals that are harsh on your skin. I have very sensitive skin and never have had an issue with any of insta naturals products I love them!</li>
    <li> Insta Natrual products are all AWESOME! The Vitamin C Moisturizer seems to be a little thinner , but still moisturizes all day!! I like how its made with all natural ingredients so  It is suitable for all skin types. I like how this can be used all over your face/body. The Vitamin C Moisturizer can be used on your eye area, hands, or any area of your body t. I use this in and the Vitamin C Serum and it&#x27;s helped to further brighten my complexion I am super happy i was able to test this out and share my review on here, This is such a great product!</li>
    <li> Absorbs well wish it was more moisturizing most of mine squirted out upon arrival during packaging I guess so half was gone, I like that it&#x27;s perfume free  just wish had more to use so that I could give a thorough reciew</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now in my 30&#x27;s and just recently I discovered products containing vitamin c (and also InstaNatural products). My skin has never looked so good. First off, this is a really good size bottle of moisturizer. I love that Instanatural products come in a pump bottle so I don&#x27;t have to dig my fingers in a jar every day. This is also a high quality moisturizer. There is no perfume scent to it. It simply smells like lotion but very very light if that makes sense. The product is thick enough where I can control it easy and only use a little to cover my entire face and neck area. Yet it&#x27;s not too thick where it feels heavy. After applied it quickly absorbs into my skin leaving my face feeling hydrated, smooth and soft. Honestly my skin feels soft even when I skip a day of moisturizing and I believe it&#x27;s from products like this one. This is a moisturizer I would definitely recommend for both men and women. I did receive a product in hopes for a review although my thoughts and opinions are always unbiased and completely my own.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive this product to try. Not being paid for opinion. Received very quickly, package was easy to open. Been using for a week. No more dry patches. Using with Vitamin C Serum. I like the consistency and there is no smell, that I noticed. I use it twice a day with the Vitamin C Serum. I will definitely purchase next time. No irritation or breakouts. Skin is smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> This is a amazing moisturizer. This moisturizer has a light texture and your skin drinks it in. My skin is brighter and has a radiance to it. This moisturizer is loaded with anti-aging ingredients. My makeup goes on better and stays longer. Vitamin C is the fountain of youth in my opinion. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. This product was provided free for testing. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product really seems to work quite well. Within two days, a family member remarked that my skin was looking better than ever. It feels softer and more vibrant than before. I use a little in the night and in the morning. I feel like it works quite well, and has felt hydrated, soft and supple. Vitamin C seems to be a great additive for my skin. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I am 56 and I am using this product as a all over body lotion to help with the signs of age spots.  It goes on white, but turns clear as you rub it in.  Makes my skin feel hydrated, but not greasy.  I would definitely recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer hast a very smooth texture and feels very fresh. I was a little overdoing it lately (my skind doesnt like to much care) so my skin needs a break and I have to use it only once a day now. Though it is &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; a moisturizer, it seems very rich an nourishing. I cannot say if I can benefit in the longterm as I have not yet been using it for too long. One star minus is only because I expected it to be more light so I could use it as much I want.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the cream itself I love the packaging and you get a lot for your money. The despenser is very preceise and you dont waste anything. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Let say the product is ok.I don&#x27;t like the scent of this moisturizer.The feel and scent is like a soap when you put it on your skin so its a little bit sticky.I use it about 3-4 weeks till now and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I am at the age where I am seeing the damage of sun, environment, stress and of course aging.  Wishing I could age &amp;#34;gracefully&amp;#34; I am fighting all the way!  Fighting to slow down wrinkles and those darn spots!  I have used many products over the years, I would not even want to know the amount of money spent on products which failed to produce results, sitting expired , unused on my shelf!  I have only used Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer for a few weeks.  I noticed one of my worse (and large) areas of discoloration not as prevalent.  Not remembering this product contained ingredients to reduce the signs of age spots.  I live in the drying winters of the Midwest to the heat of the far southwest&lt;br /&gt;during the year.  I wanted to try this Cream Moisturizer for hydration.  I am thrilled to see it really has lightened my age spots!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use just a tiny bit, this is very concentrated!  It will last longer than you think.  The cost is a fraction of anything I have found with&lt;br /&gt;the type of quality  natural ingredients. (if you do not order from this company, be sure to read the ingredients of what you are putting on your skin. So many other products &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; have chemicals, which is absorbed through the skin).  Also, I gave this product five stars because Insta Natural seems to understand the concept of &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34;.  When talking on the phone you actually get a human, they have been polite, kind and do what they say!!!!!!  This product will not be expiring on my shelf!  I will be ordering/buying this product again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love the Vitamin C Moisturizer by Instanaturals! My face feels firmer and it looks so much brighter. I have a reaction to cold and live in Western NY where the temperatures are frigid. So I do have problem skin throughout the winter. Nothing will totally sure the sorry condition of my skin during this time of year, but using this moisturizer, along with some other Instanatural products has helped so much. I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my skin is going to look come spring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided free for testing, but I was already been using the Vitamin C serum and loving it. I actually started using these products about 8 months ago and just recently received a couple free products. For which I am very grateful!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It provides everything I am looking for and it feels great on my rather sensitive skin. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It makes my skin feel very smooth. My makeup goes on flawlessly. I really love this cream. It is very kind to my maturing skin. I have used it on my hand and feet also. I wish they would sell it by the gallon!!  So happy I found this. I&#x27;m done looking for a Vitamin C moisturizer for my face. Finally!! And it&#x27;s affordable too!</li>
    <li> This a a very light yet effective all-purpose moisturizer.  It has been doing a great job of removing sun damage from this past summer.  I use it on my arms as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing. Vitamin C is essential to even complexion. Face creams can be so expensive and then not work like they claim. This product has lightened my age spots AND keeps my face soft and creamy. I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer but only use it at night since it has a tendency to leave a white film on my face. Kind of like a white overcast, similar to lotions that have a high SPF sunscreen or Titanium Dioxide. Because of this, I use this mainly at night after my serums but before my night cream.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It&#x27;s effective on aging skin, and it does not break out my sensitive/reactive acne prone skin.  I have somewhat oily, middle aged (over 40) skin and a very fair complection.  To start, so I could tell if it worked, I used this on one side of my face for a month and continued my daily routine on my entire face.  This cream erased a deep crease on my chin (on one side only).  Now I have to apply it all over so the crease on the other side disappears too.  The wrinkles between my eyes are less where I have been applying this cream and the lines on my neck disappeared where I used this product.  However, it did not seem to affect the wrinkles on my forehead and it does not contain sunscreen, so I use a sunscreen over top of this product daily.  I am going to continue using it and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer --- best value on cluttered market .</li>
    <li> I am such a big fan of this company.  I use many of InstaNatural products but this one by far is the best.  This may be the best face moisturizer I have ever used.  My skin is transforming to soft and beautiful very quickly!  Love it</li>
    <li> Nothing but positive feedback on this product. Combined it with the vitamin serum and have had no issue with breakouts- only smooth and bright skin. I was even surprised to notice faded age spots &amp; trust me, I have tried many expensive products prior &amp; they don&#x27;t even come close. Wonderful price to go along with results after a short few weeks. Best part is co-workers have complimented on my skin &amp; thought my makeup changed, but it was my skin!</li>
    <li> Really like this moisturizer, face feels lifted and the fine lines are gone!! Using with the serum great value for the effect I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works good,it has a little scent,went on smoothly, it instantly moisturized  my face and kept the moisture all day,I loved that this kept my face soft and moisturized all day.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not I use both FoxBrim and Vit. C together every night....and I love the result. Waking up in the morning with a fresh looking skin is a delight for me. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, skin feels soft and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Having a combination skin its hard to find a moisturizer that feels great and doesn&#x27;t dry skin or leave it greasy. I&#x27;m really happy with this products.</li>
    <li> The pump stopped working after a couple days and it smelled like yeast.  Consistency was very liquid like. Returned it and got Vitamin C serum instead, which had no smell and no pump.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Light fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> First let me say I was not given this product to try for my review...I purchased it.  And I LOVE IT ...I have used it for one week now immediately I noticed my facial skin felt softer and I already noticed the clarity it has brought to my face.  so Kudos to InstaNatural for that. Here is where Amazing came into play ...I have Rheumatoid Arthritis...so my hands looked like they were twenty years older than the rest of me... after one week of applying to my face and hands  ...my hands look different ... I am still in disbelief and will update later once I get a grasp on what it is I am thinking or seeing ...  even as I am writing I hold my hands up and just look in awe....you only need to apply a small portion and it goes a long ways ....from the pea size application needed it may take a year to finish this bottle....so stay tuned...</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes your skin feel silky smooth. Great price......awesome quality..... Generous amount of product. Just ordered my second bottle. This will not end up in the graveyard of un-used products. You will use every drop!!!!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny and their customer service is top notch.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times so far and it makes my skin feel great! No scent, so my husband can use it too. I would have liked a scented lotion.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t believe that a molecule of Vitamin C can penetrate the skin, I don&#x27;t care. Tis cream glides on freely and a little goes a long way. For dry skin it is excellent and I recommend it highly/&amp;quot;</li>
    <li> The only Moisturizer I have used on my face without issue. It is really rich and feels good when applied. Not sticky, greasy or heavy but if you apply too much it may begin to feel that way. I use this and my skin feels satisfied. It protects from free radicals and has formidable ingredients that are great antidioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best daytime moisturizers I have tried. Its scent is not overpowering and its texture is very syrup-y, like a mix between cream and serum. I love products in this texture because it seals in moisture, the cream is very moisturizing but does not leave a greasy feel to the skin. Its perfect enough for daytime and I don’t end up oily under my makeup (I have oily combination skin).  This product really does what it claims because I have been using it religiously for two weeks and yesterday as I was applying my makeup, I noticed that I had become 2 shades lighter. The concealer which I used for a highlighter was now matching my exact skin tone. I was very shocked and amused at the same time. I was not expecting anything drastic but depending on your skin, and your skin routine, results can show as early as 2 weeks. This is going to be a winter staple added to my routine to use as the weather gets cold.  -Oreleona [Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
    <li> Love it. I love every product I have tried from Instanatural. I will never go back to the overly advertised aging products. These are 100% better.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product if you are looking for something to help your skin look and feel smoother.  Also, the smell of the citrus in the serum and the lack of smell in the moisturizer leave you feeling fresh and clean instead of heavily perfumed with wax face.  I was given this product to review.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin moisturized with no greasy feeling. Will definitely be purchasing again..</li>
    <li> What a wonderful moisturizer for such a great price (and NO I&#x27;m not getting paid to say that!).  I can&#x27;t wait to try more InstaNatural creams!  My face feels soft and not greasy.  And, yes, you can put it on other dry areas of your body (hands, elbows, etc.).  This product is marvelous.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves the way this product makes her face feel. She said I need to buy her more.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Amazing results right away!  Love this product and the company!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a face moisturizer that I like. There are many things to like about this one---it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, it has an easy dispenser, to doesn&#x27;t leave a film/residue that I wash off the next morning (like some other brands I&#x27;ve tried), and it works!  What more can you ask for?!</li>
    <li> Great results, a bit expensive for me but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! My skin is super dry from being preggo and this really helps!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my face</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this cream but it made me break out.  I gave my face 3 weeks to adjust to it but enough is enough and I was tired if dealing with a new zit almost daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer, and I seen this one. What stood out to me about this product is the ingredient vitamin c which is good for you. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of days, but notice a couple of differences. First I notice the texture,  I normally have dry skin and it made my skin smoother. I also like its not greasy like some moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and see little results.</li>
    <li> Took me a while to start using this, since I wanted to use up my old face creme first. That turned out to be a mistake, I love this vitamin C face moisturizer. I must say that I have tried several cremes from Insta Natural, and have never been disappointed. Which leads me to the praises of this one. It soaks into the skin really smooth and fast, leaving soft smooth skin. Since I have been using it, my skin actually fells better. My skin feels healthier, and tighter. There is little to no scent or smell to the creme, which is nice since I use it on my whole face, and do not want to be overpowered by the smell all day.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick, white moisturizer that applies similar to sunscreen - it takes a few rubs to really absorb into the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel that heavy once it&#x27;s on and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to speak of.  I use this after the Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum and I really like the combination of the two.  The serum is light and liquidy and the moisturizer kind of mixes w/it to absorb better.  My skin feels tighter and smoother after using these products together.  I feel like I am fighting breakouts, healing old skin damage and firming my skin all at the same time.</li>
    <li> I had an organic moisturizer previously, and many more before that. This is the only one that didn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily after using. Minimum amount is needed for application. I have had positive results using it in my regiment. Brighter skin, maybe a more even tone. This moisturizer works for me, and my super oily skin.</li>
    <li> Makes skin look radiant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I can definitely see a difference it my skin. My skin feels softer and looks more moisturized. I also really like the smell</li>
    <li> So far this moisturizer is having a positive effect on my face and i am pleased. Follow the instruction on the application... and no need for a lot because a little goes a long way. The result is smooth clear skin.</li>
    <li> This felt a bit gummy once it drys, not sure of the benefit because I don&#x27;t like the way it feels so I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
    <li> Very good cream, is light and super hidratating, I really like it.</li>
    <li> I think I have found a moisturizer that I really like! It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all greasy. I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but unless something changes, I will be ordering more of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
    <li> I love how moisturized this makes my face feel. It is not greasy, oily, nasty smelling at all. I only use a pea sized amount, and it really goes a long way. My skin just soaks this up. I can wear my makeup over it, or put it on right before I go to bed.  There is a light scent to it, but nothing that is over powering! Over all, I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*complementary product received for review*</li>
    <li> I received the insta natural for reviewing purposes. I tried this moisturizer on and noticed that it was very thin and creamy in texture and leaves your skin soft. I also noticed that it felt a little tacky on the skin as it tried to absorb in the skin. But the good thing is that I did not break out from this moisturizer and it has many beneficial ingredients for your skin including the vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping love anything any everything from Insta Naturals These are my honest and truthful opinions #Sponserd</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels good on skin, and you only need a very small amount to apply. Only weird thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get fully absorbed so there&#x27;s a portion of it that just sits on the surface that you can only notice when you steam clean your face and when you gently scrape the area around your nose with your nail, a thick white layer would show underneath your nail which doesn&#x27;t happen to me with any other moisturizer. Weird right? But I really like how it feels and looks when it&#x27;s on, my wrinkles are definitely less visible after a month of use</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth. I only need a very small amount to cover all of my face and neck.</li>
    <li> The smell is great. Not greasy. Great pump to control how much product you are using.  After applying my face does not feel tight at all, like other beauty products I have tried. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the delivery. The product was packaged very well. Thank you The lotion is light looking forward to using morning and evening.</li>
    <li> very good moisturizer- a little goes a long way - I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and wrinkles are always more visible than most. I have to say that I really like this product. My face and neck feel soft and smooth after using during my morning routine. Drys quickly so I can apply my make up shortly after using. My wrinkles are looking less visible after using for only a week. Takes very little and leaves no greasy feeling. My skin tone appears to be more evened out and my pores are smaller.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this product would work on oily skin, but it worked great according to my girlfriend. she even mention it lighten a few off her dark spots. not much more you can ask for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a week or so and am extremely pleased with my results so far!  My skin feels and looks wonderful. Would definitely recommend for anyone with dry skin or wanting to maintain a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Great for the skin and fast delivery</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT ,HAPPY WITH RESULTS , WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum is something I will continue to use for the rest of my life. I love the smell and all of the research that I have done on it makes me feel great using this once or twice a day. I always do it after using some sort of acid.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream.  It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly.  It&#x27;s organic and effective.  I buy a lot of InstaNaturals products including their Dead Sea Mud Mask, and Vitamin C facial cleanser, toner, and serum.  All are excellent!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so wonderful. It leaves my skin soft and smooth and there is no greasy film or anything that won&#x27;t absorb. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how amazing this product is! My skin is so soft and it did not cause any breakouts like other brand moisturizers have done to me in the past! My skin also looks amazing, it really banishes my dry winter skin. I also LOVE that they do not test on animals.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! It does not go on your hands! Lol... I made the mistake of putting it on my hands before trying it on my face and it made my hands itch like crazy! However, once I did my daily routine with my face, I applied this moisturizer to my face and it was amazing! I love InstaNatural&#x27;s products! I have received a lot of them for free, but my opinion is always honest and I absolutely love every one of them!</li>
    <li> I am loving the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer. I know a mouthful to say. First of all must say bottle is huge. I personally hate getting a little thing of moisturizer. It seems the small ones don&#x27;t last as long. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! The consistency is nice quality. I am noticing with any of inst natural products my skin is feeling better. It looks healthier more awake. I know what does that mean. I will say I am a mom and when you are a mom you get worn down. With the whole line of insta natural a I am looking healthier and more awake. I can honestly say if you are in question if you should give it a try. Do. You will not be sorry. It has no became one of my favorite companies. So far everything I have gotten has been top of the line product and quality.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free for testing purposes, the thoughts are of my own.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical upon hearing about this product what does vitamin C have to do with face cream?&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dry spots on my skin mostly my face so I needed something that would get rid of them . Once using this product they got rid of them completely once I started and kept using the product. my skin was softer and not dry. It was wonderful , I love this company and its products! I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This seems to be an adequate moisturizer. Not sure it will do much for wrinkles, but does leave my face smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and really  feel my skin very different, most hidratate and most healthy, it absorbs very quickly and not greasy, i will buy again when it finish</li>
    <li> I am a fifty five year old woman who has always had acne from my teen age years. It was soo bad that when I graduated from college I threw away my graduation pictures because my skin looked so horrible. Now thank God I only have some scars left. But now I&#x27;m dealing with menopause and and the changes its causing to my skin which is dryness and loss of some tone. I received Instanatural vitamin C and the age defying skin clearing serum. I use the serum first and then the vitamin C on top. Its only been about three weeks but my skin is hydrated and the marks are a little lighter. I will continue to use both products and write another review at the the end of three months.</li>
    <li> This is nice, not overly greasy, which is something I hate and generally avoid using moisturizers because of. I don&#x27;t know if I totally believe in the value of Vitamin C on the skin but I do like the moisturizing aspect and not feeling like I need to rinse it off my face.</li>
    <li> Started applying Moisturizer on May 8th but stopped on May 12th. My face became really oily around my forehead, side cheeks, nose and chin. I started forming small bumps on those areas. I had to stop because of this. I might just have an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> this product helps me brighten my scars on my face from breaking out.it smells so good,very light on the skin&lt;br /&gt;though it gives me a little tingling effect but I guess that is OK means the product is working.&lt;br /&gt;it is not sticky.very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I think i do like it. it takes time for me to notice any difference in my face because just got it.thanks</li>
    <li> Have hearing the reviews I wanted to give it a try. I have oily to combinations skin, few dry patches on the cheeks and chin. I decided to try this moisturizer because it had vitamin c . But the more I used it the less I saw any results. My face would be come so oily at the end of the day. And I work in an office so I wouldn&#x27;t be out side. That was bad I realized it was the moisturizer.then I started breaking out in my forehead and I was like ok I need to stop this product. which I did after I stop using it I but a little of aveeno lotion on the small dry patches and not all over my face and I stop breaking out or have the grease looking skin at the end of the day.  This product is only good for people who have dry or normal skin. If u have oily and combination skin don&#x27;t get it you  will look  greasy after u use it.</li>
    <li> Great Vit C moisturiser. Goes on a little heavy but as soon as it is absorbed, it becomes very light and smooth. Does not make skin greasy. Very happy with the Vit C range, especially when used together. I find the regimen very effective and am pleased with the results on my skin. Seems to work! Skin looks and feels great. For reference, I have oily but &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
    <li> I have noticed fewer wrinkles and lighter spots. Skin feels and looks good. Product has a nice feel, goes on well. I will be trying more of the line!</li>
    <li> I give this product 3 stars because it made my oily skin feel congested and heavy. My skin did not react well but I know i have difficult skin. The moisturizer itself seemed very nice when used on my arms or legs but I was looking for a facial moisturizer. This was not a problem since it was easily exchanged for me. Customer Service is great at Insta Natural. Even if you aren&#x27;t sure you should try it, if you don&#x27;t love it they will gladly offer a refund or exchange.</li>
    <li> Seems to help with fine lines makes your face really soft</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer &amp; great customer service. Separate email with instructions was great.</li>
    <li> I have loved every product I&#x27;ve tried from this brand. Gentle but effective, nothing has ever irritated my skin. Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice!  But beware if you have sensitive skin - just use this every other day or so.  My skin feels softer and a little bright after using it at night.</li>
    <li> Great product as usual by a great company. Quick results and fabulous feeling skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying you will never be disappointed by any Instanatural product. This moisturizer is made with 20% vitamin c. Vitamin c is essential to healthy, nourished, hydrated skin. It is all natural and made with organic ingredients. It is a perfect blend for any skin type. Use this after your toner or serums and it will leave your skin radiant and glowing. The vitamin c lifts your fine lines and wrinkles as well. So you are sure to look fresh and ready to take on your day. This is non greasy and leaves your skin soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> This moisturizer, along with their Vitamon C serum, has really made my complexion brighter and more even. My pores are much smaller and I&#x27;ve not had any irritation, which is a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product once a day, it soaked right into her skin and makes her face feel soft. She has sensitive skin, so she didn&#x27;t want to use it more than once per day. After a week, her face looks more healthy and youthful. There is no irritation, but she will still stick to one time, just in case. She loves all the InstaNatural products she has used so far. After two weeks, she noticed her face was really clearing up.</li>
    <li> my teenage son used this and it was AMAZING.  teenagers are prone to break-outs, and after washing his face with a gently cleanser, he&#x27;d use this moisturizer sparingly. after almost two weeks of daily use, his face became clearer and all the whiteheads gone!</li>
    <li> My favorite facial moisturizer yet. It has such a nice consistency and very light scent. I put it on sometimes after a toner and other times i just use it alone, it works nice both ways. This item was sent to me for review but this my 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer - it absords fast and makes my skin feel and look great - it is a nice large size - I use this in the morning and love it.  This is a good company for face and body products -</li>
    <li> I may upgrade my review to 5 stars later but I&#x27;ve used this product for a month.  It seems to definitely improve the tone and quality of my skin, remove lines and generally work as advertised.  It is hard to say with skin products but it works at least as good as anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This was a good product, so if you&#x27;re turning away because it got 4 stars instead of 5 please stay. It did everything I expected it too, which is to moisturize my face, reduce discoloration, and just overall help my skin. The smell is okay, though I don&#x27;t know if that matters to everyone. The texture is the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It feels a bit oily when you apply it on your skin and so gives it a greasy feel. This is gone after applying and waiting a few minutes, but I still didn&#x27;t like the feeling while applying it. But it did resolve that problem by itself in a few minutes so it&#x27;s just a minor dislike that shouldn&#x27;t affect anyone. Overall I liked the product and feel as if it would go well if paired with the serum. Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> nice clean feeling moisturizer</li>
    <li> Great just love it !!!</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  I have seen a great improvement in the tone and texture of my skin.  Hyper-pigmentation has always been an issue for me but now my skin-tone is more even.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily like others have in the past. I deff reccomed this product.</li>
    <li> great product, I&#x27;m dark skinned, and this helps brightens and restored my skin to my youthful self.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product,leaves your skin feeling fresh. All day hydration. Not at all greasy and quick absorption. Very much satisfied with this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer daily.  It reduces the signs of aging.  My skin looks less wrinkled, smooth and nourished.  I have noticed that some dark pigmentation is becoming lighter and I have not used the entire container yet.  I really like the way the container dispenses just the right amount so there is no waste.  This is another great skin care product by instanatural.  I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer for a week now and I really like it. I have always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that didnt leave my skin feeling oily since I do tend to have oily skin...but this moisturizer hydrates my skin without leaving it shiny. (Note: at first my skin felt very greasy but after a couple of minutes the mousturizer would dry and leave my skin feeling very soft.) Also...even though this product is not intended to be a primer I personally felt like my makeup went on smoother and it stayed matte longer. Over all I am very excited to have found this mousturizer and intend to keep using it. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I used this moisturizer along with the Vitamin C serum for about a month now, and it worked really well.  I noticed the difference on my chest first with the sun spots and freckles becoming less noticable.  It took longer to make a difference on my face.  But now I notice the spots are fading and my skin is not so splotchy.  I have very sensitive and VERY dry skin.  This was fine for my sensitive skin, but I did notice that I needed some additional moisturizer some days.  Of course it is winter in the desert, so the air is incredibly drying to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> This is such a great moisturizer!!!  It goes on great &amp; absorbs well.  Since I&#x27;ve started using it, my skin has never looked better!  My brown spots are fading &amp; wrinkles seem to be diminishing!  I also use this with their Vitamin C Toner, &amp; Vitamin C Serum, then follow with this moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve tried many other products from this company &amp; absolutely love all of them (from their hair products to face products).  I highly recommend their product line &amp; love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for free for testing purposes, and would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was using Cetaphil in the morning and at night. It wasn&#x27;t doing its job and my skin was very dry, flaky, gross. I couldn&#x27;t control it because it was mostly caused by the harsh, dry, cold weather here in New England. I bought this Vitamin C moisturizer and the Night moisturizer as well. They work great together! The night moisturizer is thick and keeps my skin moisturizer throughout the night. The Vitamin C moisturizer is thin and dries quickly, making it ideal for mornings before school. Despite being light, it keeps my skin moisturized throughout the whole day (something Cetaphil couldn&#x27;t do.) Both creams keep my skin calm, and do not irritate me. I am excited about the other ingredients in here and their long-term benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and want to keep it calm and not red, try this!</li>
    <li> Great product. I felt better moisturized skin in a week. Product provided for free for my testing purposes. It was a great freebie!</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of a topical Vitamin C product I have purchased and I prefer this product over the other. It goes on smoothly and does not cause skin irritation and does not have a strong scent that would be annoying.</li>
    <li> First of all, I would give it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t perfect! I love its smell and texture, and I loved the results. I have some freckles in my face and they are fading! And I&#x27;ve been using this product for just two weeks and once a day! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. So, I really recommend it. By the way: Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> One of the best Vitamin C moisturizers out there!</li>
    <li> This product really lives up to its reputation.  I will be a return customer!&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;ve come back to purchase this facial moisturizer, and it is one of the best creams leaving your face and hands incredibly soft.  I double up and use a face serum first.  After the serum dries, the cream provides the perfect surface for applying makeup.  It only takes a little bit out of the pump for both your hands and face.  It&#x27;s non-oily, not greasy.  And I love the vitamin C that goes to work on your face making wrinkles less noticeable and reducing aging spots.</li>
    <li> What a nice surprise- a facial cream that really works!  My skin feels wonderful, looks smoother, younger, etc.  The even bigger surprise for me was that for fun, I tried some on my arms.  I really forgot about it, until the next day when I looked down and noticed they looked different.  The freckles seemed a bit lighter, and the skin was just more even all around. Even better, they felt at least 10 years younger to the touch!  My husband even noticed a difference!  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t normally use lotion- I do nearly every day.  But this one obviously made some noticeable changes!  I will be looking into other products they make now...</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter and nothing seems to help until I tried this! I got the chance to review this product and I am in love! I used this on my body as a regular lotion in a few spots that are the worst including my back *between my shoulder blades* and this made a WORLD of difference for my skin! I apply it once every 5 days or so and it&#x27;s amazing! It is lightweight and just feels great on. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this or any of insta naturals products!! I have yet to be disappointed in my orders!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product!! I use it twice a day and find that it is a perfect daily moisturizer. I have combo skin, oily tzone and dry everything else. My t zone is moisturized but it does not get as oily later in the day. My skin feels very smooth and silky after and my favorite thing about it is how matte it makes my face look.  My skin looks almost air brushed after this cream. There isn&#x27;t really a scent, it isn&#x27;t sticky, glides smoothly, absorbs very fast, and a little goes a VERY long way. I use this over the vitimin C serum and am very impressed with the quality of the products. I would recommend and will definitely continue to use. &amp;#34;Product provided for free for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t have a very good reaction to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it because of the great ingredients but unfortunately my skin broke out terribly after 2 uses.  I have combo skin with dry cheeks, and don&#x27;t experience many break outs.  I do however have sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m a product junkie, always like to try new moisturizers, cleaners and serums but this one just didn&#x27;t sit well.  Hopefully everyone else, will like this product.  It has some really good stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works really well for my skin! It feels and looks much healthier compared to other brands that I&#x27;ve used in the past. I use if after washing and toning my face in the morning. I put it on quite generously all over my face and it keeps my skin looking great and matte. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and I am glad that I my face doesn&#x27;t get as oily as before. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light, daily moisturizer. The only downside would be that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF. I will continue to use it nonetheless!    Product provided for free for testing purposes (thank you!)</li>
    <li> Really great stuff. Family members noticed the improvement without me even asking. Highly recommended.  Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Ok here we go. So I hate reading reviews in amazon. First, Cos there&#x27;s a bunch of products who pays people to do a review. 2nd,i dont even know of some of the reviews are real. So I told myself That if ever i purchased anything from Amazon, I will always Give my Honest opinion and review about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a dry, oily and acne prone skin! weird but thats the truth can&#x27;t even explain how my skin looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this vitamin c moisturizer just to give it a try! Shipping was fast, 3 days after i got it already.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of using it together with the vitamin C serum I bought (in amazon as well)&lt;br /&gt;i noticed My face got hydrated and my skin feels more firm and tight. The results are amazing for two days? That&#x27;s pretty cool. So i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks bow and I will get my self another one if I ran out. (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a a few weeks now and it&#x27;s helped with dry skin this winter. I don&#x27;t usually have dry skin, but this winter has been rough. The dry flaky patches have pretty much disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer is perhaps my favorite product by InstaNatural.  I have oily skin in the T areas and this moisturizer leaves my skin soft, moist but never greasy or sticky.  Even after many hours.  My skin feels healthy and a little smoother too.  A little goes a long way.  Love the product, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It has a light almond smell which is very natural.  First time I used it I pumped 2 times(which I did for my other moisturizer)......I was so wrong I used way too much cos it&#x27;s quite rich.  Second time I used 1 pump only and it&#x27;s definitely enough for whole face and neck.  A little goes a long way cos as I said it&#x27;s quite rich.  I used it with Instanatural vitamin C serum......hopefully it will help my freckles to fade away.....I have only used it about 3 weeks.....so I will keep my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin nice and moist.</li>
    <li> Very nice will probably buy again</li>
    <li> This Moisturizer is perfect for the whole body.  A little bit goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy.  It&#x27;s a perfect combination with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum &amp; the Vitamin C cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using the vitamin c lotion for about 3 weeks now and very much enjoy it and really like the results.  It&#x27;s replaced a very expensive name brand for me that I&#x27;ve used for the last 5 years and didn&#x27;t think I would ever change.  Will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this moisturizer.  I use daily on hands and face for the protection and repair provided by Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month, and I am pleased with the results.  My skin is softer and looks &amp;#34;relaxed.&amp;#34;  This is my second order, and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this moisturizer for a month. But I use it daily, and I love the way it feels. It feels really lightweight but effective and a little bit goes a long way. I put it on before sunscreen. My skin is more radiant than ever, and still feels replenished after a long day. It&#x27;s significant to have Vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate), Hyaluronic acid, and MSM in one product!  I&#x27;m definitely excited to add this moisturizer to my routine and will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I like the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product the other day and was so excited to try it! All the reviews sold it for me but as soon as I opened it, I discovered this horrible smell of this product! How am I supposed to put this on my face If it smells so bad?! I am so sorry, but reviews that I read mentioned that it has no smell but it&#x27;s just not true!! I will be applying on some troubled/dry areas of my body instead but definitely not going to apply anywhere close to my nose. I do like the texture of the product.</li>
    <li> See my review under this manufacturer&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. Combined use of both products daily (am &amp; pm: before bed) and their results, have been truly AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Its a great face cream. Goes on light, NO SCENT, and it feels GREAT!!! :)</li>
    <li> i just ordered my second bottle and am also trying the eye gel this time.  It is highly moisturizing and I have a new glow in my skin ( I am 62 by the way).  More than anything the packaging is perfect.  Every last drop comes out.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this, I wish I would have found It sooner, I have paid for pericone n many HIGH priced face stuff &amp; this Is amazing, It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily, goes on smooth, will buy forever, Great price,</li>
    <li> Seems like a good, natural moisturizer for the right price.</li>
    <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of InstaNatural products! Great ingredients and really effective! I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. I then use the InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner and the Age-Defying Skin Clearing Serum. Pretty easy routine and I love the glow my skin has!</li>
    <li> This is a really good moisturizer, my skin feels so smooth, im noticing something good happening to my skin. I will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It never feels greasy and I can wear it under my make-up. Other products have left me feeling like my foundation &amp;#34;slipped&amp;#34;. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> So far this moisturizer is working well. It&#x27;s my first jar, and I can say the small lines have lessened and dark spots seem.lighter. I&#x27;ll stay with it and report back again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  I can tell a difference in only a few short weeks.  Great addition to my daily face regimen!</li>
    <li> I love all the instanatural face products and this one does not disappoint. My fac feels fresh and has a glow after use.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how big the bottle was and I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and love it would recommend it and will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and it does its job moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin and I find that I really have to rub it in more compared to other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed anything that stands out at this point.</li>
    <li> I really love the customer service of this company.  However, the product does not work out for my skin; I got little irritations after putting the cream on my face and the feeling goes away in few minutes, but I don&#x27;t think I should continue using because my skin doesn&#x27;t want to make friend with it. Even so, I decide to give a 4 star for how they handle my problems during the transaction.  I have to return the product but will give another try on their other products since they earn my trust.</li>
    <li> Great facial moisturizer. A little dab&#x27;ll do ya! Light scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer! This is so essential for your skin, you can never have enough moisturizers. This is one of my favorites. Very hydrating and really helps to add a nice glow to my skin. *product provided for review*</li>
    <li> Skin feels very soft and is more radiant.  Hoping for some sun damage repair...</li>
    <li> Helps mousturize skin well. Doesn&#x27;t help with wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lighter than the Night Express cream, but not too thrilled. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well. Leaves your skin smooth and not greasy. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in a long time!! I love it</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I really love how this smells! It massages in nicely and leaves my skin very smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth moisturizer.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product.. Will order again</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not greasy and quickly is absorbed by my skin leaving it dewy and moist.  I use it both morning under my makeup and in the evening when I wash my face I put it on to do it&#x27;s moisturizing while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly.  I could start using it right away.  Don&#x27;t know if there is any improvement to my skin.  It is easy to use, has a nice texture, few man-made chemicals compare to other products I&#x27;ve used. I am using this with  Hyaluronic Acid Serum - BEST Anti-Aging Skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a niacinamide product for acne and hyperpigmentation issues, and also a different one with vitamin c.&lt;br /&gt;This combo has all that I&#x27;m looking for!, if only this had retinol in it, it would be perfect. But I think they made it that way because retinol is not stable and suitable for a day lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it, as I don&#x27;t like the heavy texture of sunscreens for a everyday face lotion. Besides, I can use sunscreen easily on top of it only if I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture, it absorbs easily, even though it takes about a minute to absorb, it does not leave any residue. You are left with a sensation of clear skin, and you can another layer of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin, prone to eczema an rosacea, an it hasn&#x27;t give me bumps, allergies or itchiness like most products do.&lt;br /&gt;I like that is unscented because I am a man, I am also allergic to parfums besides finding most smells hideous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are about to be seen, but if this product really have all those amazing ingredients in effective concentrations, it should be working. I have only use it for 4 weeks, but I notice more &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; in my skin. This has replaced my previous favourite cerave lotion, it feels similar but with a lot more benefits in terms of acne/hyperpigmentation/general skin ageing.&lt;br /&gt;I still get some acne, but I cant complain because not even prescription products can control my acne completely.</li>
    <li> After using for just two weeks, I noticed an improvement in the complexion on my face.  My skin tone/color is more even.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all.  Took alot to rub it in.  Didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
    <li> I use the Vitamin C cream moisturizer after I have used a Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid to lock in the serum and prevent dehydration and dryness.  It is a great moisturizing product to be used with or without a Vitamin C serum.  I started using it only a few weeks now and I noticed the difference immediately.  I feel it keeps skin irritation and inflammation down by hydrating your skin and this eliminates or masks  the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the ocular area.</li>
    <li> I got this off a review site for cheap and now after tryimg it. Its part of my regular beauty routine. I plan on buying another one. Also my m bought herself one cause she liked mine so much.</li>
    <li> Love the way my face is beginning to feel soft and refreshed. I am only a few weeks into this regimen and will continue to use this and see the results.</li>
    <li> love it smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a very good vitamin c moisturizer!!!  During the winter season my skin always get super dry. My target area using this moisturizer was my elbows and my nose. They always get so dry, itchy, flaky, and sometimes they even form a scab. I put a dime sized amout in my hands and rub them together. When I put the vitamin c moisterizer on it gave me relief immediately! I had a bad acne patch on my cheeks one summer from the heat and my oily skin didnt help it out any. I tried popping the pimples and they left really ugly scars that made my cheeks look black so i used the vitamin c moisterizer on my face for like a week and my face is starting to clear up a lot of all the discoloration is now and even skin tone so I have to encourage everybody that is having problems like I did to really try it!!! This is a free product used for review purposes.  \\&quot;[[ASIN:B00QL1ZJK8 VITAMIN C CREAM MOISTURIZER SKIN RESTORER]]\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Moisturizer is great!  It is smooth and creamy, yet light.  It goes on and absorbs nicely and, once absorbed, is not noticeable.  After using even once, my face definitely felt moisturized and dry patches were less noticeable.  I love the dispensing container as opposed to dipping my fingers into a jar.  This way I get what I need, but do not introduce bacteria or other icky stuff into my moisturizer.  I was also pleased with the light, fresh scent - nothing perfumey or overwhelming, and any smell dissipated as the product dried.  The true test of a moisturizer for me is what it does, not only to my face, but to my hands and feet as well.  So, though this was designed for faces, I gave it a shot on my feet and was very pleased at how well it worked there too!  This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> No matter which moisturizer from InstaNatural, I&#x27;ve liked it. The Vitamin C Moisturizer seems to be a little thinner in consistency, but still moisturizes all day. It is suitable for all skin types. One great aspect to many of InstaNatural&#x27;s products is you can use them for multiple uses or all over your face/body. The Vitamin C Moisturizer can be used on your eye area, hands, or any area of your body that needs a little extra moisture. I use this in combination with the Vitamin C Serum and it&#x27;s helped to further brighten my complexion help diminish the appearance of pores. I have been using this during the day with the Retinol Moisturizer at night. I love how my skin has been looking and can&#x27;t wait for continued improvement! I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> Made my skin breakout all over after one use. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Keep my skin moisture and soft the whole thing I love about it because of the vitamin in it the most amazing part the best</li>
    <li> I simply love this moisturizer. I received a bottle to review and I love how it feels and how it makes my face feel. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy afterwards either. Instead it feels smooth. We are having some very cold weather this year and this is helping to keep my face from getting dry and itchy from all the exposure to the cold outside air and the heated inside air. I love using it in the tops of my hands as well!&lt;br /&gt; It It&#x27;s also a really nice sized bottle and since it takes a very small amount to cover my face and neck, it will last a good amount of time. I have used a few other products from this brand  and they don&#x27;t disappoint. The are easy to use and easy on the skin as well.</li>
    <li> When I was given a chance to get this I was really excited. Then to get it and try it, I was amazed at the lightness of coverage it has I can put it on and not feel like my face is caked in a mask or not allowing my skin to breathe. If anything it feels more a buzz if that makes sense. Like there is this bright and energize feeling coming from the inside out. I get this proudness out of it. After applying it I certainly feel as if my best face if being put forward and that amazes even me on the days I feel like a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
    <li> I have to say Instanatural has yet to disappoint me. It seems that each new moisturizer from InstaNatural has added more ingredients and benefits that the previous moisturizers did not have. The updated versions have the combination of the new ingredients we (aging) women crave in out skin care. Not only does it brighten cause of the Vit C, but the added Niacinamide for the help with clearing blemishes and is the youth in a bottle ingredient as well. This is very hydrating without being heavy or oily. There is no scent and is soothing to the face. I have been using this on my elbows and legs as well. Just to let you know it can be used on these areas as well I have some darkened areas on my knee from scraping it over the summer and the scar (dark spot) is there and seems like it has a vengeance. This keeps my legs moisturized and while I haven&#x27;t noticed the lightening of my scar just yet, I am going to keep at it. This was sent for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have found InstaNaturals&#x27; organic products. This Vitamin C moisturizer is easy to use, and a little goes a long way. It has a nice consistency, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I love my restored, glowing complexion. I use this after applying the Vitamin C serum and it works great. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> My skin was feeling dry, dull and it looked uneven. Love this brand because it&#x27;s natural and ingredients are always good. So decided to try their vitamin C cream and right away my skin felt soft, healthy and moisturized. After longer use my winter skin wasn&#x27;t dry any more and even my esthetician noticed that my skin looked brighter, more youthful and age spots looked more even. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and has a nice scent. I will keep using this cream for even more results.</li>
    <li> This product is a rather &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; product. It doesn&#x27;t really do much, and isn&#x27;t great for sensitive skin. The last time I used this, I had really dry skin, and when I applied it, i felt a burning sensation. It really hurt, and after using it for 2-3 times, I stopped. For that, I don&#x27;t recommend this to people who have dry or flaky skin. This moisturiser also has a weird smell, which isn&#x27;t very pleasant, but if you don&#x27;t mind smells, then you can probably get over it. Overall, I do not recommend this, and will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. If you love the other products of this line like I do you&#x27;re not gonna be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes along way. It goes on really smooth and leaves your skin feeling moisturized. I think I use about a 4th of a pump and it covers my entire face. So definitely gonna last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any unwanted effects from this product. I&#x27;ve been using a lot of face masks lately and this product has helped my skin not get irritated or over dried out from using face masks so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased the Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid and they&#x27;re great to go along with this.</li>
    <li> This product was provided for free for testing purposes.  I used it in conjunction with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the product would be alone, but combined with the serum, it was outstanding.  I have been using both twice a day for approximately a week.  The biggest difference I have noticed is with my malasma.  I am prone to malasma and during pregnancy developed an area of darkening underneath one of my eyes and spots across my cheekbones.  After only a week, I am noticing that these are actually lighter.  I&#x27;m hopeful that these will continue to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is light and applies easily.  It seems to absorb very quickly and does not leave skin greasy.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about what I use on my skin and stick to all natural products without chemicals. I actually love finding a product that is both affordable and one that will live up to my expectations. A product that actually makes a difference. I think I will be using Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer from now on, along with some of the other Instanatural products that I have also tried. I have not seen a drastic improvement yet, as far as wrinkles go, but I do see a difference in the overall texture, in that it is more refined, and I do not have a problem with dryness. I intend to keep using this and hopefully, my skin will continue to become clearer and smoother as the weeks go by.&lt;br /&gt;“Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
    <li> I have been using the InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturizer for two weeks and I have noticed that my dark spots have gotten lighter. My skin is very soft and is never dry.  It spreads on very nicely and a little goes a long way.  I wear mineral makeup and at times it has looked powdery but since I have been using the  Vitamin C Moisturizer my make-up looks like it was airbrushed. I have used it on my hands and they no longer look old and dry, they look so much younger. The ingredients are all natural and don&#x27;t clog you pores. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look in a month. Product provided for free for testing purposes.    2-13-2015 - update on my review  I have been using the Youth Express Vitamin C Moisturizer for several weeks. In the past several weeks I have notice my skin has gotten very soft, even younger looking and my age spots have gotten lighter. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and the ingredients are all nature. I also love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I am looking forward to see how my skin will look in a month or two.  I also wanted to say how impressed I am InstaNatural as a company.  They have taking the time to email me personally to see how satisfied or unsatisfied I am with the Vitamin C Moisturizer product. This shows me that they care about their company and you care about me as the consumer. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Vital C repair moisturizer and was looking for a less expensive alternative. This product has been a great alternative at a much more affordable price point! I use this vitamin c moisturizer daily, morning and evening after I wash my face and apply a toner. It&#x27;s texture is a little different at first when you put it on, but it applies smoothly and soaks into your skin well, leaving a smooth and clean feeling once its all worked into the skin. I don&#x27;t have any problems with oily skin during the day with this product!</li>
    <li> Pros: Good moisturizer that&#x27;s perfect for using every day. It&#x27;s not scented which is nice for those sensitive to fragrances and perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The packaging is hard to read. I don&#x27;t love the dispenser that always seems to drip a little extra lotion out after I use it. The product itself though is amazing--not too thick or too light. I think it&#x27;ll be good for all seasons throughout the year.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any change</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. I got the serum as well and I think they work well for my skin, it&#x27;s nice and soft. I think I&#x27;ll switch to those for a while, until I find something better at a lower price. I have sun spot on my face during the summer time, so I&#x27;m curious to see if the vit. C will help with those so I don&#x27;t have to spend $30 for &amp;#34;Image&amp;#34; brand. 1 pump is too much, I do half for my face. *update* I don&#x27;t like using this cream any more. It just doesn&#x27;t provide enough nutrition to my skin, even after I put it in a glass jar and added a few drops of oils like Argan, Jojoba, Rosehip... So I switched back to my Yves Rocher facial creams! The vit. C serum by the way is not as effective as my Image Skincare serum regarding my sun spots, so I won&#x27;t be buying that again either.</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturizer but don&#x27;t use twice a day, it will dry you skin.</li>
    <li> Caused dry patches on my skin</li>
    <li> Smells slightly citrus and feels very good on the skin.  I have been testing for allergies (I am sensitive to some additives in lotions) and I am very happy to report that my skin likes this product!</li>
    <li> The product is good. Meets my expectations . Saw a visible glow on my face within 2 weeks of using this product</li>
    <li> This is a very thick moisturizer. I really like that the pump amount is generous enough to use on both my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This made my face break out, but used on my neck and chest, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used other creams for my face now (Anavita, Vernal).  Those are far more expensive than this, so it&#x27;s nice to have a cheaper version that is useful on those areas that use so much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on white and does fade, so don&#x27;t freak out when you have a hard time rubbing it all the way in.  It will soak in.  As I said, it made my face greasy and break out, but does wonders for my neck and chest (and hands and arms--any extra product on my hands gets rubbed into my hands and arms).</li>
    <li> I just had break out....:(</li>
    <li> I have really fallen in love with the InstaNatural line and am now on a mission to try out all of their products! Like their other moisturizers, this is light and airy and leaves my skin feeling very smooth. Living in Florida my skin has a tendency to dry out from the humidity, and I&#x27;ve already seen a great change with my skin being very moisturized. Will definitely be ordering again in the future!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  At the beginning, I was not exfoliating properly and my skin felt grease. Now, I am exfoliating two times a week and my skin is looks healthier and softer. I am buying this product again most definitely.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. My skin is so soft. It works better than my Really expensive stuff !!! Sun damage is going away !</li>
</ol>
