### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is GREAT!!</li>
      <li>so this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Bishop&#x27;s Discount Depot is awesome</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for that perfect strawberry gloss/balm/shimmer/something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Setting that aside, the product is great.  </li>
      <li>Good for use, I feel happy after I use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that all seem good until you get to the end</li>
      <li>The mint gives your lips a tingle and it has fairly good staying power.</li>
      <li>It smells good and make the skin moisture.</li>
      <li>It blends well with my coloring (fair but ruddy strawberry blond)</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is always good quality, though.</li>
      <li>Lip shimmer feels so good when it goes on.  </li>
      <li>Color made my skin kind of washed out.  </li>
      <li>Nice color.</li>
      <li>i really love this color..and look good on my lips..</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but this did not look good on my lips at all.</li>
      <li>It seems more like a chap stick, which I love!</li>
      <li>More pigmented than I thought but still nice</li>
      <li>It makes my lip feel cool, and the color is good.</li>
      <li>Product is ok.  </li>
      <li>Burts Bees lip shimmer always look cute.</li>
      <li>I suppose :)</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Always love the BB and will continue to purchase these lip Shimmers, DFW</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the product description well enough...not sure.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It is okay.</li>
      <li>Love the mint sensation when I put it on...</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bee products.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It has a pretty bright color and does provide soothing protection for the lips, as well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go for a bold shade that would scare me off indefinitely so a nice pink seemed the best choice.  </li>
      <li>The great thing about it is it&#x27;s natural, and the color can be seen your lips.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the shade, too light for me.</li>
      <li>Moisturizing and cheap</li>
      <li>With a fresh minty taste (that lingers for about an hour), cute color, and easiness to ship (arrived in the middle of predicted dates), there&#x27;s no reason to say no to an organic lip gloss that works great.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much!</li>
      <li>First off, let me give a glowing review to the seller for getting this to me so very fast, and with free shipping.</li>
      <li>The color is sheer and nice, but a bit too glittery for my liking, which might or might not contribute to making my lips feels a bit drier.  </li>
      <li>Leaves them soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression that this would be sheer-not a true glossy gloss by any means, but something more like Aquafina&#x27;s lip balm, with maybe a little more shimmer.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount for summer.</li>
      <li>Goes on fine and looks pretty nice, but a little frosty.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t stop my lips from getting dry but felt nice going on.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t my number one favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees shade (that would be raisin) but it is good for when I want a little something more than plain lip balm, but nothing so colorful I have to worry about coordinating it.</li>
      <li>but the price is pretty steep.  </li>
      <li>Ok  but not the big</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my pretty Peony from now on.</li>
      <li>All in all, I really dig it!  </li>
      <li>Next time I would buy more deeper color which hopefully will turn my lips into pinkish or reddish colored ones.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wished I really observed better before opening would be the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I bought a few of these for my sister&#x27;s stocking, and she was very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but the only complaint I have is that I have to reapply fairly often because the lip shimmer comes off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make a difference to anyone that eats those things anyway though.</li>
      <li>I really like the champagne color of the lip shimmer, but this strawberry one goes on streaky on the lips and seems to pill.  </li>
      <li>I really like this gloss</li>
      <li>I am usually a strictly colorless chapstick kind of gal.  </li>
      <li>It feels really nice on the lips, almost like the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick (minus the tingle).  </li>
      <li>The strawberry color is light pink and shimmery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not much of a bubblegum pink kind of gal.  </li>
      <li>I put it on everynight before bed and my lips are so soft and shimmery in the morning!</li>
      <li>It feels pretty good on the lips, but no real strawberry taste/tang, which was my first disappointment.</li>
      <li>The only thing I do not like is it runs out too fast.</li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>Good for a casual day.</li>
      <li>The Strawberry adds the lightest pink color and just the right amount of shimmer to your lips.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping that it wasn&#x27;t bubblegum pink, but it was.</li>
      <li>The color wasn&#x27;t a really far stretch from my natural lip color (but then again, I&#x27;ve been told I have naturally pink lips.)</li>
      <li>But really, really disappointed after all of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>, it gives a little bit of color not to much.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin due to Lupus and medications that I need to take.</li>

<li> I feel like my lips glow in the dark!</li>
<li> Not a huge fan of the color.</li>
<li> This in no way reflects negatively on the seller-just in my disappointment.&lt;br</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll put it in the \\&quot;fail cosmetic\\&quot; basket I have on the shelf in the bathroom.</li>
<li> Canola oil comes from rapeseed aka poison, soybean bad for hormones and GMO, others are metals which I avoid.</li>
<li> worst of all, dries out my lips</li>
<li> Not too awful probably compared to unnatural types of makeup, but I got this thinking wouldn&#x27;t contain these things.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Burts Bees lip shimmer always look cute. This one succeeded. With a fresh minty taste (that lingers for about an hour), cute color, and easiness to ship (arrived in the middle of predicted dates), there&#x27;s no reason to say no to an organic lip gloss that works great.</li>
    <li> I have multiple shades.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second Burts Bees Lip Shimmer that has arrived melted and not usable.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It makes my lip feel cool, and the color is good. I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Good for use, I feel happy after I use it. It smells good and make the skin moisture. I like it!</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the color. Burt&#x27;s Bees is always good quality, though. It is okay. Moisturizing and cheap</li>
    <li> Always love the BB and will continue to purchase these lip Shimmers, DFW</li>
    <li> This lip shimmer does its work but it was not what I wanted. I thought it would give my lips pink color but it is colorless. Next time I would buy more deeper color which hopefully will turn my lips into pinkish or reddish colored ones.</li>
    <li> The strawberry color is light pink and shimmery. The great thing about it is it&#x27;s natural, and the color can be seen your lips. You don&#x27;t have to worry about petroleum byproducts or parabens because they don&#x27;t use it to make this lip shimmer. It does tingle slightly when you apply it, so if you are sensitive this might not be for you. Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but the only complaint I have is that I have to reapply fairly often because the lip shimmer comes off pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Nice color. I love Burt&#x27;s Bee products. The only thing I do not like is it runs out too fast.</li>
    <li> 1. Minty&lt;br /&gt;2. the lip balm is too narrow to apply properly&lt;br /&gt;3. worst of all, dries out my lips</li>
    <li> More pigmented than I thought but still nice</li>
    <li> I really like the champagne color of the lip shimmer, but this strawberry one goes on streaky on the lips and seems to pill.  Not very flattering.</li>
    <li> I like the color and feel of this product. It has a pretty bright color and does provide soothing protection for the lips, as well.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that it wasn&#x27;t bubblegum pink, but it was. I&#x27;m not much of a bubblegum pink kind of gal.  This will be relegated to at-home or before-bed use - I feel like my lips glow in the dark! I&#x27;ll stick with my pretty Peony from now on.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s.  It is the only thing that keeps my lips from chapping in the winter time.  And a hint of color is a bonus...</li>
    <li> I like burtsbee products but I didn&#x27;t like the shade, too light for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I put it on everynight before bed and my lips are so soft and shimmery in the morning!</li>
    <li> Love the mint sensation when I put it on...</li>
    <li> I really like this gloss, it gives a little bit of color not to much. Just the right amount for summer. I do not use a lot of make-up so this is perfect. Good for a casual day.</li>
    <li> First off, let me give a glowing review to the seller for getting this to me so very fast, and with free shipping. Bishop&#x27;s Discount Depot is awesome and I would/will definitely buy from there again-hands down. This in no way reflects negatively on the seller-just in my disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product...Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer...not what I was looking for. It feels pretty good on the lips, but no real strawberry taste/tang, which was my first disappointment. But even that is not as off-putting as the baby pink ice-pearle finish. I was under the impression that this would be sheer-not a true glossy gloss by any means, but something more like Aquafina&#x27;s lip balm, with maybe a little more shimmer. I don&#x27;t know why I thought that it would be like that, but I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting pearle. It&#x27;s a creamy, ice-pink, pearl-ized gloss-not a sheer shimmer- that is reminiscent of my pink make-up follies in the 6th grade-a dark place I dare not revisit in my adult years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the product description well enough...not sure. But really, really disappointed after all of the great reviews. Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for that perfect strawberry gloss/balm/shimmer/something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d send it back but it would just be too much trouble. I&#x27;ll put it in the \\&quot;fail cosmetic\\&quot; basket I have on the shelf in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I am usually a strictly colorless chapstick kind of gal.  I never wear lipstick or anything of the sort.  So, I bought this on a whim.  I didn&#x27;t want to go for a bold shade that would scare me off indefinitely so a nice pink seemed the best choice.  It feels really nice on the lips, almost like the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick (minus the tingle).  The color wasn&#x27;t a really far stretch from my natural lip color (but then again, I&#x27;ve been told I have naturally pink lips.) All in all, I really dig it!  My boyfriend also seemed to like it too, which is always a plus... I suppose :)</li>
    <li> The color is sheer and nice, but a bit too glittery for my liking, which might or might not contribute to making my lips feels a bit drier.  Feels and smells minty but has no taste.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these for my sister&#x27;s stocking, and she was very pleased with it. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but typically Burt&#x27;s Bees is worth the little bit extra!</li>
    <li> Saw this in a magazine and wanted it.  Ok  but not the big wow that I thought  it would be.</li>
    <li> I bought this at 17dollar here in this country..about quater the price here..i really love this color..and look good on my lips..</li>
    <li> Product is ok.  Nothing special.  Color made my skin kind of washed out.  Didn&#x27;t stop my lips from getting dry but felt nice going on.</li>
    <li> Not good. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but this did not look good on my lips at all. Way too creamy.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Just a touch of color.  Lip shimmer feels so good when it goes on.  It seems more like a chap stick, which I love!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin due to Lupus and medications that I need to take. This stuff is GREAT!! It doesn&#x27;t make my lips sore or peal. Leaves them soft and healthy. Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees for making something I can finally use!</li>
    <li> Goes on fine and looks pretty nice, but a little frosty. The only thing I wished I really observed better before opening would be the ingredients. It&#x27;s a shame that all seem good until you get to the end and it contains canola oil, soybean oil,mica, titanium dioxide (which is probably what gives shimmer/frost look). Canola oil comes from rapeseed aka poison, soybean bad for hormones and GMO, others are metals which I avoid. Doesn&#x27;t really make a difference to anyone that eats those things anyway though. Not too awful probably compared to unnatural types of makeup, but I got this thinking wouldn&#x27;t contain these things.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my number one favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees shade (that would be raisin) but it is good for when I want a little something more than plain lip balm, but nothing so colorful I have to worry about coordinating it. It blends well with my coloring (fair but ruddy strawberry blond) I think.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this a 5 but the price is pretty steep.  Setting that aside, the product is great.  The Strawberry adds the lightest pink color and just the right amount of shimmer to your lips.  The mint gives your lips a tingle and it has fairly good staying power.</li>
