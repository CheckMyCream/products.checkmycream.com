### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It does give some volume and separates my lashes but for best results I go in with a coat of lash blast volume from covergirl that does a wonderful job of separating and fullness</li>
      <li>The instructions state that, for best results, the user should sweep the brush from root to tip of lashes, and continue building volume until the desired lash look is reached.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Couple of tips:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying this mascara is kind if</li>
      <li>I love the ease of use of this product (no clumping, good coverage) and the fact that it stays put until you intentionally remove it.</li>
      <li>Whatever the case may be, I get more volume and length with Rocket than with Lash Sensational.  </li>

      <li>While I liked some more than others, I felt they were still lacking something.  </li>
      <li>They add that the product is contact lens safe and ophthalmologist tested, and will remove easily with soap and water or a good eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>Lasts all day and easy to remove!</li>
      <li>This really does fan out your lashes, leaving them looking beautiful and voluminous.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I still love this WATERPROOF version of mascara.  </li>
      <li>(I also use coconut oil most nights to soothe my eyelashes and eyebrows.)</li>
      <li>I ordered the Too Faced, Better than Sex mascara</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a lover of Maybelline mascaras, then you&#x27;ll probably love this one as well.  </li>
      <li>I was in love the moment I put it on</li>
      <li>But with many mascaras I&#x27;ve tried none help with them not sticking together.</li>
      <li>My night routine doesn&#x27;t need one more step (and more products to buy and use) just because of my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can I love the finish result, but dislike the way it washes off?</li>
      <li>I can not even begin to declare my love for this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Boy, I sure regret that.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>I use coconut oil mostly, and that works fine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see if this one gets even better.</li>
      <li>so I need volume the most.  </li>
      <li>So I’ve tried many types of mascara.  </li>
      <li>Anything more than</li>
      <li>and I found myself really struggling to get good coverage.  </li>
      <li>affordable new mascara from Maybelline is AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>Is also easy to take it off with a makeup remover or coconut oil.</li>
      <li>It did not come off easily at all.</li>
      <li>but they curl easily.</li>
      <li>This formula does not run or flake, yet comes off easily with cleanser.</li>
      <li>This is a good mascara for the most part, definitely gives them more volume.</li>
      <li>Just as I was about to try the more expensive brands, I read the awesome reviews about Lash Sensational and thought</li>
      <li>With lash sensational I have no smudge problems, no flaking and no hard time removing it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge mascara junky</li>
      <li>My lashes separate very nicely, but I noticed that if I apply a second coat it can get prone to clumping, so I just stick to one.  </li>
      <li>I love maybelline mascaras and this one is another stellar addition to the collection.</li>
      <li>The brush is great, it separates my lashes while coating them evenly and making them really long.</li>
      <li>Also, as a girl with oily eyelids, I can happily, excitedly, wholeheartedly say that this mascara does not smudge or flake throughout the day--</li>
      <li>This product is lightweight, but it packs a significant punch of drama.</li>
      <li>Then clean up specks and smudges from my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a more positive note, this mascara stayed on all day, with almost no flaking or fallout.</li>
      <li>which is the only good thing I can say for it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there, especially since they discontinued my beloved Lash Stylist years ago.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite mascara that I have in my collection.  </li>
      <li>I love the wand, It really separates and define your lashes.</li>
      <li>I quickly got the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>Clumped tremendously.</li>
      <li>It is my new favorite drugstore mascara.</li>
      <li>This mascara really makes my eyes look bigger and gives me that more dramaticlook that I love.  </li>
      <li>and this has got to be my favorite so far.  </li>
      <li>I love wearing this, because it lengthens and separates for that effortless, natural beauty look.  </li>
      <li>Favorite Mascara so far.</li>
      <li>Lash Sensational really does provide a lot of coverage, and if you need to CURL your lashes prior to applying (which I always need to do!)</li>
      <li>right off</li>
      <li>I have long lashes that can get a bit unruly so the brush for me is the most important thing.</li>
      <li>And my lashes are super short, and yet I noticed them more with this mascara on.</li>
      <li>I’ve been using this product for a month or two and strongly prefer it to the previous Maybelline product I had tried, Great Lash Big.  </li>
      <li>I tend to go for mascaras that make my lashes look huge and glamorous, but sometimes i want to pull off the natural look,  </li>
      <li>After I rinsed my eyes out, I chucked it straight into the trash!</li>
      <li>love this product, but somehow the &amp;#34;fake lashes&amp;#34; fell off and irritate my eyes, but only sometimes after rubbing my eyes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I even stopped wearing eyeliner most days because this mascara works so well that I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s absolutely necessary.</li>
      <li>It really does fan out my lashes and gives volume!</li>
      <li>If I can only apply one coat, I want to make sure each and every lash is coated and has maximum volume and length.  </li>
      <li>The side that&#x27;s supposed to be more comb-like has bristles that are TOO short.</li>
      <li>When I took my makeup off at the end of the first day I used it, I had to check the tube to see if I bought waterproof by mistake.</li>
      <li>My opthalmologist suggested (because my eyes were a little red) that I use a q-tip with warm water and 1/2 drop of Baby Shampoo and gently wipe along the lashes and then rinse with warm water at the end of each day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure others can appreciate the long wear</li>
      <li>I tend to roll my brush when I apply mascara anyway, so I&#x27;m comfortable applying it the way they suggest; I have, however, seen YouTube beauty vloggers apply this the traditional way with the same results, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s user preference.  </li>
      <li>The color is nice and dark</li>
      <li>otherwise your lashes will get really clumpy.  </li>
      <li>It dries so fast</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Finally, a mascara that actually does not smudge!</li>
    <li> I found that this mascara did what it claimed for the most part, but also left my lashes kind of hard and brittle feeling...and then it started flaking after a few hours. I also noticed a bit of transfer on my eyelids by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Three uses and I&#x27;m ready to toss this mascara. Don&#x27;t like the brush, don&#x27;t like the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is long lasting, but difficult to remove. It dries quickly -- which is both a positive and a negative. It dries so fast, it&#x27;s difficult to go back and separate the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew this mascara was trouble when I pulled the brush out of the tube and heard a giant sucky sound, like pulling a boot out of mud. The brush is coated with way too much mascara. There&#x27;s so much product on the brush that I can barely distinguish the bristles. I can see wads of product in the spaces and rows between the bristles. Wiping the brush on a tissue removes product from the tips of the bristles, but I need a backhoe to remove the excess from between the rows of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is one of those molded plastic ones and the bristles are a bit too far apart. It&#x27;s hard to apply the mascara evenly. Then there&#x27;s the excess mascara lurking in the spaces between the rows of bristles. This excess likes to glue lashes together in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is simply difficult to use. The plastic brush is part of the problem. I wipe the wand off on tissue, but there&#x27;s still excess product trapped in the space between the rows of bristles. After applying the mascara gently and carefully, I had to go back and separate the lashes. Then clean up specks and smudges from my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, this mascara stayed on all day, with almost no flaking or fallout.</li>
    <li> I fancy myself something of a drugstore mascara connoisseur. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there, especially since they discontinued my beloved Lash Stylist years ago. I have long lashes that can get a bit unruly so the brush for me is the most important thing. Mascara formulas are generally pretty similar across the board in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is just garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER, that I can recall, thrown away a tube of mascara after a couple of uses. Even when I try a new one and it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;, I keep using it until it&#x27;s gone. BUT NOT THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is terrible. The side that&#x27;s supposed to be more comb-like has bristles that are TOO short. And forget doing your bottom lashes without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the worst is the mascara itself. I&#x27;m sure others can appreciate the long wear but I don&#x27;t. When I took my makeup off at the end of the first day I used it, I had to check the tube to see if I bought waterproof by mistake. It did not come off easily at all. It&#x27;s somewhere between normal and waterproof - long wearing enough to be annoying to remove but not enough to be...well...actually waterproof. My night routine doesn&#x27;t need one more step (and more products to buy and use) just because of my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the trash with this!</li>
    <li> Can I love the finish result, but dislike the way it washes off? I am not sure if it&#x27;s the type of mascara, but it washes off in chunky flakes. I thought it was weird, but because I love the look I bought another and it did the same thing. I made note not to wear this to the pool or any where I would get wet. But I am definitely a Maybelline Lady right here!</li>
    <li> love this product, but somehow the &amp;#34;fake lashes&amp;#34; fell off and irritate my eyes, but only sometimes after rubbing my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;it holds my curls all day long, doesn&#x27;t add my volume, just darken my lashes&lt;br /&gt;even it is not waterproof, it resists water and my tears.&lt;br /&gt;easy to remove by warm water.</li>
    <li> The application &amp; result was just ordinary and the removal was horrible. I&#x27;m losing lashes and I was careful to buy the non-waterproof formula.. I used the same remover that I always have, abolene. I&#x27;ve only used it once since purchase and it&#x27;s going into the trash. Not worth losing lashes over!</li>
    <li> Several years ago Maybelline won me over with their Volum Express Colossal Mascara.  After trying that iconic little gem in the yellow tube, I was eager to try pretty much every other mascara Maybelline released after that; I&#x27;ve tried every product in the Volum Express line but haven&#x27;t loved them as much as the first with the exception of the Pump&#x27;d Up (in the pink tube).  Well, for some crazy reason, when my Pump&#x27;d Up ran out, I decided I wanted to branch out and try something different.  I picked up several different drugstore options but I was disappointed because I didn&#x27;t get that full volume look I craved (I have fine, blonde lashes of medium length and slight curl, by the way).  I picked up stuff from Wet N Wild, Milani, Physicians Formula, LA Colors, Hard Candy, all which had 4+ reviews online.  While I liked some more than others, I felt they were still lacking something.  Just as I was about to try the more expensive brands, I read the awesome reviews about Lash Sensational and thought, what the heck, let me go back to Maybelline and see if this product is really worth all the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy molely I must have forgotten how much I loved Maybelline mascaras.  I know some people hate them and swear by other drugstore brands, but Maybelline really doesn&#x27;t disappoint when it comes to me.  I love this mascara!!  While there is a bit of a learning curve with the application (the first couple of tries left a little mess near my eyebrow bone) I quickly got the hang of it.  I tend to roll my brush when I apply mascara anyway, so I&#x27;m comfortable applying it the way they suggest; I have, however, seen YouTube beauty vloggers apply this the traditional way with the same results, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s user preference.  This really does fan out your lashes, leaving them looking beautiful and voluminous.  The length you get is amazing!!  Once again I have lashes that almost touch my eyebrows.  This mascara really makes my eyes look bigger and gives me that more dramaticlook that I love.  The formula is not too wet or dry.  My lashes separate very nicely, but I noticed that if I apply a second coat it can get prone to clumping, so I just stick to one.  Even with one coat, though, I get a great look, so it&#x27;s not a problem.  Also, as a girl with oily eyelids, I can happily, excitedly, wholeheartedly say that this mascara does not smudge or flake throughout the day--AT ALL!  It&#x27;s brilliant, although it is a little bit harder than other mascaras to remove.  I have to go over it twice with my oil-free makeup remover, and it still left a little bit of residue on my lashes.  While it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me, it may be a turn off for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This affordable new mascara from Maybelline is AMAZING!  I was in love the moment I put it on and I&#x27;ve learned my lesson about trying mascaras from other brands.  If you&#x27;re a lover of Maybelline mascaras, then you&#x27;ll probably love this one as well.  If you&#x27;re looking to try something new, this is one I recommend 110%.</li>
    <li> Amazing mascara for the price!!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to remove even with makeup-remover.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!!</li>
    <li> I have never loved a mascara like I love this one! My blue eyes water a lot so racoon circles are unavoidable with most mascaras, I know I can use waterproof but that seems so harsh and gross to get off and it made my lashes thin. With lash sensational I have no smudge problems, no flaking and no hard time removing it. I even stopped wearing eyeliner most days because this mascara works so well that I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s absolutely necessary. Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> My new go to mascara. I have semi-long lashes, and this adds volume for me. I put on two coats. I do not put mascara on my lower lashes.  This formula does not run or flake, yet comes off easily with cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge mascara junky and I love Maybelline because they make great mascaras. However, they dropped the ball on this one. There are so few bristles that the mascara gets stuck in the wand gaps, which leads to way too much mascara that clumps instantly on your lashes and makes a goopy mess. It&#x27;s a huge design flaw, which makes application really messy and difficult. It&#x27;s alright if you wipe the wand a couples times, but that&#x27;s just a huge waste of mascara. Definitely not buying this again. I&#x27;d stick to the Falsies collection.</li>
    <li> I can not even begin to declare my love for this mascara.  Two words: holy grail!!  I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the market, high end to low end and this has got to be my favorite so far.  I jumped after putting two coats, they were SO HUGE and FAKE LOOKING.  It&#x27;s insane.  I don&#x27;t have very many lashes and they are thin but this made me look like I had hundred and hundreds of beautiful separate long thick lashes.  It&#x27;s everything you could want in a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe anyone would rate this less than a 5 but I think it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t know how to properly use the wand/brush.  You&#x27;re supposed to use the short side to coat the lashes with mascara and then the longer sides to fan and separate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost get scared to use this every day or more than one coat because they look so extreme!  I&#x27;m in love!!  The only other mascara I&#x27;ve ever loved near this much is Loreal Voluminous Million Lashes which was my holy grail prior to this.  Check that one out too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attached picture is with only one coat.  Anything more than that is more dramatic for every day use!  Insane.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t mind that I have to use a little soap to get my mascara off at the end of the day as long as my eyelashes look like this why complain?</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of weeks before I couldn&#x27;t stand using it and threw it away. It clumps badly, flakes, and it is hard to take off even though it wasn&#x27;t the waterproof formula. I&#x27;ve used make up wipes and coconut oil to take the mascara off and there&#x27;s still residue. This just wasn&#x27;t the mascara for me. Sorry.</li>
    <li> This product is like a varnish that will not come off.  It made my lashes hard and rigid.  I had to use a great deal of eye makeup remover over and over again before I could get it to come off--the residue just kept surfacing.  I lost eyelashes.  It&#x27;s hard on the eye area to keep rubbing away at it.  I will throw it away after I submit this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rhiana</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite mascara that I have in my collection.  I ordered the Too Faced, Better than Sex mascara and I never grab for it.  This Maybelline is my one and only haha</li>
    <li> It was 100% all bad! Was a thick mess that made all my lashes stick together into 5 or 6 spikes that were impossible to separate. Then it dried &amp; crumbled all over my cheeks and fell into my eyes. After I rinsed my eyes out, I chucked it straight into the trash!</li>
    <li> I tend to go for mascaras that make my lashes look huge and glamorous, but sometimes i want to pull off the natural look,  I love wearing this, because it lengthens and separates for that effortless, natural beauty look.  It&#x27;s not caked on like volumizing mascaras, which also makes it easier to remove at night.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t hold the curl in my lashes at all.  And it doesn&#x27;t give me much volume either.  Like almost all waterproof formulas, you can&#x27;t apply more than one thick coat otherwise your lashes will get really clumpy.  But my other waterproof mascara does hold the curl all day so this one was a true disappointment.  The brush doesn&#x27;t reach every lash and I found myself really struggling to get good coverage.  The color is nice and dark which is the only good thing I can say for it.  Even with a thin coat, there were some clumps and too much mascara builds up on the tip of the wand.  My regular waterproof mascara is The Rocket and although I&#x27;m not a fan of the brush, it does build considerable volume without clumps.  It also holds the curl.  This may be a result of the shape of the brush or because it&#x27;s a totally different formula, I&#x27;m not sure which.  I think it&#x27;s unlikely that Maybelline has numerous waterproof formulas.  It&#x27;s more like they only have one and simply offer different brush styles.  Whatever the case may be, I get more volume and length with Rocket than with Lash Sensational.  If I can only apply one coat, I want to make sure each and every lash is coated and has maximum volume and length.  I can actually apply two thin coats of Rocket because it seems to take a little longer to dry (which is a good thing).  I use the Diorshow lash primer and then Rocket (Diorshow mascara sucks, btw) and I get full, dark lashes that look like falsies.  My lashes may have thinned with age, but they&#x27;re still very long so I need volume the most.  Rocket is my go-to product and I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on Lash Sensational.  I may be looking for a mascara unicorn but there&#x27;s bound to be a waterproof formula that permits several coats and still holds a curl.  So I&#x27;m still searching.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m sticking with Rocket because I refuse to spend big money on a product that only lasts three months.  For now, Rocket is the winner.</li>
    <li> The formula is smooth, very black and so far no flaking or clumping. The brush? Couldn&#x27;t get used to it. I ended up with eyelashes stuck together so I cleaned and used my mascara wand from my old mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this.  This review is for the WATERPROOF version.  I&#x27;m going to purchase the other type as well because this Waterproof one is definitely not easy to remove.  I use coconut oil mostly, and that works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of tips:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying this mascara is kind if &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;1)  As with any other mascara, if you find the wand/brush has too much liquid, remove the wand and run it lightly across an old washcloth or something.  Works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I find that this mascara isn&#x27;t the best for the lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved the Maybelline Rocket Volume mascara, so I use that for the lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Lash Sensational really does provide a lot of coverage, and if you need to CURL your lashes prior to applying (which I always need to do!) using the inside/small bristles, run a coat on upper curled lashes.  Let dry for 5 seconds, then apply second coat (if you even need it!)  This mascara provides a full, beautiful look!!  Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I still love this WATERPROOF version of mascara.  I wear it daily  (I don&#x27;t really care for the other version - I use an eyelash curler and the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t hold up... it doesn&#x27;t keep my lashes curled at all).&lt;br /&gt;This waterproof is difficult to remove.  My opthalmologist suggested (because my eyes were a little red) that I use a q-tip with warm water and 1/2 drop of Baby Shampoo and gently wipe along the lashes and then rinse with warm water at the end of each day.  It works well!  No more red eyes.  (I also use coconut oil most nights to soothe my eyelashes and eyebrows.)</li>
    <li> I have worn literally dozens of different mascaras- from drugstore to expensive department store brands. I have very long lashes, so it&#x27;s pretty easy for me to tell which products are clumpy, heavy, etc right away. This product is lightweight, but it packs a significant punch of drama. It wears all day without flaking or crumbling. It is my very favorite mascara of all that I have used.</li>
    <li> Favorite Mascara so far.</li>
    <li> I usually have problems with mascaras bothering me and irritating my eye. This doesn&#x27;t give as much length as I thought I would but I&#x27;m still very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of use of this product (no clumping, good coverage) and the fact that it stays put until you intentionally remove it. Removal is a little more labor intensive than some other mascaras, and it kind of comes off in clumps, but I think that is an acceptable trade off for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t run, smudge or wear off during the day.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t do anything to thicken or lengthen lashes. It clumps lashes together, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This formula lengthens by lashes dramatically. It does give some volume and separates my lashes but for best results I go in with a coat of lash blast volume from covergirl that does a wonderful job of separating and fullness then I go in with a coat of lash sensational for length</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Falsies for a long time now but the last couple of tubes I&#x27;ve purchased have dried up &amp; been crumbly really fast so I decided I&#x27;d give this new one a try. HORRIBLE! First, it&#x27;s very clumpy and the brush is a terrible design and worst of all, this stuff is harder to get off than waterproof. I had to use my regular cleanser which always gets the Falsies mascara right off AND use eye makeup remover AND THEN use my cleanser again. Absolutely dreadful product!</li>
    <li> Makes ur lashes look GREAT!</li>
    <li> I am not used to mascara so it caused some slight irritation, but other than that it was a really amazing product.</li>
    <li> I just came home from buying this, and literally just now put it on. I was worried about the design of the wand, but it&#x27;s actually a great idea. It really does fan out my lashes and gives volume! And my lashes are super short, and yet I noticed them more with this mascara on.</li>
    <li> Clumped tremendously. Would not purchase again! No matter what mascara I put over or under it, this just clumped continuously.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have tried so far! Makes my lashes look longer and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge into my face at all. Lasts all day and easy to remove!</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara from my local grocery store when they were out of Black Drama. Boy, I sure regret that. The brush is absolutely useless, it makes my lashes stuck together (instead of fanning them out as advertised), it is IMPOSSIBLE to get off without ripping your lashes out, and for some reason, it turned my eyes red whenever I used it. That&#x27;s the last time I experiment with other maybelline products.</li>
    <li> Good Mascara It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other have in the past..</li>
    <li> I repurchased this because it&#x27;s a great mascara. I was stuck on a Sephora one and tried this one out and wow. It&#x27;s amazing. I have naturally long eyelashes but they curl easily. But with many mascaras I&#x27;ve tried none help with them not sticking together. This one does!! I high recommend it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m really into makeup and the high end ones I&#x27;ve tried have nothing on this one!</li>
    <li> Got this mascara after reading a recommendation for it in a magazine. It is my new favorite drugstore mascara. Curls, thickens, and darkens with no clumps!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. I love the wand, It really separates and define your lashes. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever!!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I loveee this product. Make your eyelashes double size and the black is really good black. Is also easy to take it off with a makeup remover or coconut oil. Whatever you decide i prefer coconut oil for put some extra moisturizer in.</li>
    <li> I love maybelline mascaras and this one is another stellar addition to the collection. I was sad that they seem to have discontinued One By One but now I don&#x27;t even miss it. The brush is great, it separates my lashes while coating them evenly and making them really long. I have only used it a few times and usually I feel like mascaras work a little better after about 7-8 uses. I can&#x27;t wait to see if this one gets even better. I seriously love this mascara! I agree with other users though about the waterproof one being impossible to get off. I usually just use soap and water to remove my makeup but the waterproof one is hardcore so I bought the regular one and it stays pretty well without spotting above my eyes.</li>
    <li> Maybelline Lash Sensational Mascara. Well-known cosmetics firm Maybelline presents this new mascara, which promises lots of volume—layers and layers of lashes -- with no clumps or mess. The very black mascara is washable, delivered to the lashes on a patented fanning brush with ten layers of bristles that capture and unfold layer upon layer of lashes for the new full fan effect, getting to each and every lash with precision, for volume that builds with each coat, and that the liquid ink formula will coat lashes from all sides.  They add that the product is contact lens safe and ophthalmologist tested, and will remove easily with soap and water or a good eye makeup remover.  The instructions state that, for best results, the user should sweep the brush from root to tip of lashes, and continue building volume until the desired lash look is reached.  They warn, however, that the use of this product should be restricted to the user; that the applicator should be treated with the hygienic care the user would give her eyes.  Also they warn that the product should never be used in a moving vehicle, diluted with water, saliva or any other substance; that the cap should be closed tightly after each use.  And that use of the product should be stopped if change in color or appearance occurs, or it the eye is injured, irritated or infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are pretty scanty, despite my having tried half the eyelash enhancers on the market.  I’m just plain in the age range where eyelashes start to get scanty, plus for many years I had a real unproductive nervous habit of tearing my eyelashes out.  So I’ve tried many types of mascara.  Most get all over my eye area, as my lashes are so few; some irritate the area.  I’ve been using this product for a month or two and strongly prefer it to the previous Maybelline product I had tried, Great Lash Big.  This product really does enhance whatever eyelashes the user has, without clumps or mess.  And it doesn’t seem to irritate the sensitive skin around the eyes. Recommended.rritate the sensitive skin around the eyes. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara for the most part, definitely gives them more volume. I like the curved brush. My only dislike is that it makes my lashes pretty stiff and even though this isn&#x27;t waterproof it&#x27;s hard to get off. Overall, this is good for a night of going out when you really want a look of false lashes but don&#x27;t want to wear them</li>
