<li> It stains your skin, so be extra careful where and how you apply this product.</li>
<li> I have about 50 percent grey and did my hairline around my face and part.</li>
<li> Goopy and not natural looking.  </li>
<li> My recommendation is to apply the color to dry hair completely and then to use a round bristle brush and hair dryer to evenly distribute and set the color.</li>
<li> other root covers I have used have left a powdery residue and&lt;br /&gt;are</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t dry hair correctly when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money!  </li>
<li> Not worth the $48</li>
<li> I used a blow dryer to dry it and a q tip to remove the small amount of product I got on my temple.</li>
<li> I&#x27;M TRULY MAD OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT THAT ISN&#x27;T WORTH 3$.</li>
<li> I was worried that it might be runny and just make a mess.</li>
<li> When  Apply it you will get a little color on your hands after a couple Washes that disappears.</li>
<li> Never got to use bottle was dried up.</li>
<li> Basically a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> As a result the brush and colorant dried up and was unusable.  </li>
<li> When Root Vanish was recommended, I was anxious to try it.  </li>
<li> but  unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last one wash.</li>
<li> The color was not good, and it is sort of messy.  </li>
<li> It is thick and stays on the applicator brush.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> Color consistency is thick, does not evenly disperse from the brush and is impossible to apply evenly</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also quite expensive, and I think overpriced.  </li>
<li> Way too expensive for it.</li>
<li> My hair is very thin and Brittle, so I cannot color it.  </li>
<li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
<li> This product is the worst.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The cap to close the brush and colorant was defective.  As a result the brush and colorant dried up and was unusable.  Great waste of $50!</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Never got to use bottle was dried up. I let seller know but never heard back.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a product for root touch ups in between my color appointments.  When Root Vanish was recommended, I was anxious to try it.  Although I was using it for the first time, the application was easy and the directions were very clear.  It blends in with your hair color but you do have to blow dry the area quickly after application, to make sure it blends well.  It also lasted through the next shampooing without reapplication.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Covers easily and looks natural.  Takes several clicks but definitely stretches a root fix out a couple extra weeks.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Root Vanish, I can go twice as long without needing a salon appointment to cover my grays. The brush allows for the easy application of color. The color stays put, even after the steamiest gym class! My recommendation is to apply the color to dry hair completely and then to use a round bristle brush and hair dryer to evenly distribute and set the color. I will definitely be recommending this product to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren S.&lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles, CA</li>
    <li> Easy to use but  unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last one wash. For an emergency it is great if can&#x27;t get to the salon and need a quick fix.</li>

    <li> The color was not good, and it is sort of messy.  It&#x27;s also quite expensive, and I think overpriced.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, perfect colour match and so natural looking!!  And the bonus is that it is still there after you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money!  Color consistency is thick, does not evenly disperse from the brush and is impossible to apply evenly</li>
    <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I GOT A LIGHT BROWN COLOR, THE COLOR STICKS TO YOUR SCALP BADDLY, AND IT DOESNT TURN OUT AS THE COLOR YOU WANTED TO BE, IF YOU WASH YOUR HAIR THE NEXT DAY, THE COLOR IS GONE!!! JUST FADES INSTANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;I USED IT AS INSTRUCTED IN DIRECTIONS, BUT 48$ TO PAY FOR THIS, ITS STEALING AND NOT SATISFIED.&lt;br /&gt;IVE BEEN PURCHASING STUFF IN AMAZON FOR A LONG LONG TIME, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I&#x27;M TRULY MAD OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT THAT ISN&#x27;T WORTH 3$.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, as it buys you time between colorings, which for me are every 4 weeks. Don&#x27;t love the price but the control and delivery of color is great and it is not sticky or hard to control as spray root touch ups.</li>
    <li> Did not cover the gray and left a yellow-ish tint on my roots, then when I went to my salon to get my roots done professionally , the color would not take.  Not worth the $48</li>
    <li> It is aa jel like substance and it changed the color of my hair.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I saw this product in a newspaper article and thought it was worth a go. I have tried nth number of similar products that tricky to apply, leave streaks, goo on my hair, stain my scalp and don&#x27;t match my color. Basically a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This products is truly revolutionary! It goes on easily, the color matched my tone perfectly (light brown) and the result looks natural. Unnoticeable, which is what you want. The instructions are very clear and simple. It says you must blow-dry it once you apply it and they are absolutely right. The results are flawless. No sticky hair. No stains. Any residue on the skin is easily removed with a q-tip (before it dries) without taking it off the hair. I love the packaging too. Very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing out there, that I have tried, compares to this. Absolutely well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Root Vanish By Kazumi (Light Brown) is my new favorite root color!&lt;br /&gt;The other root covers I have used have left a powdery residue and&lt;br /&gt;are matte. Root Vanish goes on wet, is easy to apply and leave my&lt;br /&gt;hair shiny and manageable; just like I want it!</li>
    <li> The brush is redundant--the entire contents would need to be deployed to saturate the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Remove the brush, use gloves, and apply with fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;The color and consistency is very good for my medium brown hair</li>
    <li> I have been losing hair ( thyroid problems).  My hair is very thin and Brittle, so I cannot color it.  Has saved my life as I have gray colors it beautifully. When  Apply it you will get a little color on your hands after a couple Washes that disappears. I will buy more</li>
    <li> Great product - best of all I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product, works exactly as per the instructions.</li>
    <li> Goopy and not natural looking.  Can&#x27;t dry hair correctly when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, it works so well and easy to use. The coverage also lasts for a couple days. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst. It says you get 100 uses. I got 2.  Way too expensive for it. Total rip off</li>
    <li> The color was very orange compared to my brown hair.  It stains your skin, so be extra careful where and how you apply this product.</li>
