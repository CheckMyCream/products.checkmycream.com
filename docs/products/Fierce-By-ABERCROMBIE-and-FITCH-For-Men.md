    <li> Arrived quick and just as advertised</li>
    <li> This is the same nauseating scent that hits you when you walk into any Aberchrombie &amp; Fitch retail outlet. To keep things succinct, the smell is sickening. The only thing \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about it is that it probably an excellent insect repellant. And rest be assured, that is not the only thing it will be repelling.</li>
    <li> Women love this stuff.  I think it stinks, but hey, I what I think doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition. It was kept in a box with a lot of thermocol so that it stays safely. It came from US to singapore in 10 days</li>
    <li> came in fast, smells great</li>
    <li> thank for the promt delivery i like it much</li>

    <li> My favorite cologne. I wish they made this in perfume as well. Could not find a better price anywhere else.</li>
    <li> The item met my expectations, love the scent. The size should last me awhile. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
