<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We purchased the Philips Sonicare HX6921/02 in September 2013 and it died last month, just 18 months after purchase. As we live outside the US/overseas, we had to pay EXTRA shipping and customs duty so it cost us nearly US$300 in total. We nor IN FACT anyone is able to purchase a battery to replace a (dead) battery in the Philips Sonicare HX6921/02 unit because the battery unit is non replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish we knew that at the time of purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the tooth brush worked very well for the 18 months it lasted, even at the initial cost of US$150, for a product to last just 18 months and then have to purchase a new unit because the battery is non REPLACEABLE, is not fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planned obsolescence indeed! Caveat Emptor!</li>
    <li> This is my second one, the last one lasted close to 4 years.  The old one my dog is using it since it does work.</li>
    <li> perfect size, works great</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my last one after 3 -4 years of daily use,just died.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted the same model. It has great features,especially for someone with periodontal issues&lt;br /&gt;Dentist and hygienist see a definite improvement since I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
    <li> Great until it breaks. Frustrating when the vibration stops working.</li>
    <li> Do not buy theses brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes if well used malfunction just over the year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They vibrate constantly, stop and dont recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had 2 and the same thing. The customer service is appalling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I go with the same model. It really does the job, and my dentist can testify it. The only down side is the life span which is 2 year +/-.  So basically you would be spending $10 per month (including the brush tips) for home oral care.... where usual tooth brush would cost $4 and last 3 months or what not.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again 2 years later tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I tried this and see if it would fix the brush. Somehow it did not work on mine.&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_G1JJ6l7N0I</li>
    <li> the last one I had lasted a little over 2 years, then the battery died. I think the problem is the corrosion at the base of the handle where it charges. Despite me taking meticulous care of it, wiping/drying it after every use, the base of the handle eventually turned yellow, the rubber edges were worn from mosture. I think that caused problems with battery and/or motor. Philips refused to replace it since it was out of warranty. I am giving it another shot, hopefully this time it lasts longer since it&#x27;s not cheap. It&#x27;s great when it works.</li>
    <li> The last one broke after a couple of years, I hope this one last a little longer!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble with long battery life between charges. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement. This is my second one. The first lasted about 5 years.</li>
    <li> I have oral b 5000 for about 4 years now. Finally it is giving up on me. Unfortunately sonic brush is very painful to my gums, irritation to the point that I went back to my oral b. Immediately gums were fine again.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as always did an outstanding job with return.</li>
    <li> All I can say is since I started using this brush after gum surgery 5 years ago, my dentist is always telling me I&#x27;m doing everything in my power to keep my gums and my teeth clean. I follow the 30 second warnings when its time to move to the next section of the mouth so my total time is 2 minutes. Due to the surgery I did have my setting is &#x27;sensitive&#x27;. Then for just a few seconds I change the setting to &#x27;gums&#x27; to quickly do the part of my gums where I am prone to tarter build up due to genetics. Then I take a normal soft tooth brush and do the surface pretty fast. All of this of course after flossing. My previous 2 of these lasted about 2 years each. This model is slightly updated as my previous one had the massage setting but not the gum setting. I&#x27;m hoping I get more than 2 years on this one.</li>
    <li> Appreciated sensitive brushing-------much easier to clean than basic model</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush does a great job cleaning your teeth. It have five different modes that you can use. I like that one that vibrates every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to the next section that you want to clean. This goes on for 2 minutes. Changing brushes is easy and charging is the same.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that this unit seems to last about 2 years. My last one broke down about this time and that is why I am ordering another one.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this Toothbrush is a good unit. My dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> vibrations are intense...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does it work?  well, between another for night use, a sonicare for day use, and a regular for touchups, my dentist seems happier</li>
    <li> Excelent!!! whiter teeth in two weeks</li>
    <li> Good product, solid delivery, has worked fine for 1 month.</li>
    <li> Works well. Nothing else to say right now.</li>
    <li> I had been an Oral B electric toothbrush user for many years and when that finally gave up I asked my dentist for a recommendation and she advised to buy a sonicare. The brush head is a more traditional shape than the round head on the oral b and I find this is more effective in reaching the different areas of my mouth. It did take a little time to get used to the &amp;#34;buzzing&amp;#34; feel when I first starting using it, but now it feels fine. I like the different settings and the fact that it beeps when you are brushing to tell you to move onto the next section of your mouth. Toothbrush came with charger and travel case. Overall I am very happy I made the switch.</li>
    <li> Mah teeth are so cleeeeeeeaaaan.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I can actually feel and see the difference! It beats my old CVS electric brand by miles! Glad I bought it. The travel kit is nice too.</li>
    <li> Been using one for approx 3 years after being recommended by my dentist and periodontist. The Sonicare cleans my teeth very well and has different settings so you can be sure to brush the proper length of time. This is a replacement for my original purchase. I returned the original while under warranty because it stopped working/vibrating properly; Sonicare replaced it without a problem but the replacement has now done the same and the warranty is over, so...</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I have been using for a week now and love it. I have used oral b for years and thought i would try this, i wish i would have many years ago!! so much quieter and my teeth really do feel cleaner!!</li>
    <li> This has been our toothbrush of choice for about 5 years.  It provides a great clean.  The downside is the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement tips are expensive (way more expensive than seems reasonable given that it&#x27;s just a plain toothbrush top -- over $10 each), and the units seem to only last around 2 years before malfunctioning/dying.  If you replaced the heads as recommended and had a unit lifetime like we&#x27;ve experienced, you&#x27;d have a yearly operating cost of around $200.&lt;br /&gt;Still, we&#x27;re on our third unit because it does clean very well.</li>
    <li> I have been a Sonicare user for many years and have gone through quite a few. The last 2 flexcare toothbrushes that I have purchased have been of very poor quality. Both have stopped working within 3 months whereas in the past they have lasted up to a year with daily use. This is a 5 star product on day one but I&#x27;m going to have to try a different model or brand this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 10 minutes on chat with Philips and they are sending a replacement.</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticeably cleaner the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and after using it three times, I am hooked.  I love the clean feeling that this gives my teeth and it does feel like you just went to a cleaning at the dentist.  This has several settings although I haven&#x27;t used them much yet because I am still getting used to the toothbrush.  I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Soooo much better than a manual toothbrush! My last check up the Dr could tell the difference.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is sleek and stylish. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few night and my teeth feel great. Love it!</li>
    <li> Been using for about 2 weeks and am LOVING it. Great substitute from my manual toothbrush. Highly recommend. Noted: This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Sonicare rocks. My dental hygienist could tell I was using it. Pretty excited too, because it cut down our &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; scraping plaque. I am an every day tea drinker, 5-6 cups so my teeth are always discolored, but the plaque stays darker, its embarrassing, this toothbrush has eliminated more than half of that embarrassing color buildup.</li>
    <li> Like it until it&#x27;s broken after using 2 years. Have to buy a new one..</li>
    <li> awesome toothbrush. never going back to regular brush or another brand.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Got one earlier that did not have as much power. Worth the money for this one.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a 0 I would! This is the second one I&#x27;ve had in 2 years and both have quit within 6 months of purchase. Might as well forget about trying to return it too.</li>
    <li> met all my son&#x27;s expectations for his birthday gift</li>
    <li> Has multiple settings, cleans your teeth like a dentist clean feel</li>
    <li> Best sonic toothbrushes. We get great results at our dentist ever since we started using Phillips Sonicare.  It&#x27;s worth every cent &amp; more.</li>
    <li> Cleans great is a bit noisy. The only huge downside is it doesn&#x27;t last very long and now not only am I out an expensive toothbrush, I have several expensive replacement heads I can&#x27;t use. I&#x27;ll be shopping around for another brand.</li>
    <li> Should have got one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> This was actually recommended to me by a dental assistant as a more effective way to prevent plaque build-up near gums and in hard-to-reach areas.  I find (after a week or two of using) that the intuitive timer ensures I brush my teeth more methodically.  Thirty seconds in each quadrant: outside of upper teeth, inside of upper teeth, outside of lower teeth, and inside of lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly, my teeth feel much cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, it&#x27;s a serious investment and -- like many other reviewers have mentioned -- the inclusion of only one brush attachment comes across as an inappropriate move on the part of the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I own one for home and one for the office. These are great toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The handle would charge and not vibrate and a humming sound was coming. Customer care told me that they cant replace this unit as it is out of warranty. I got less than 3 Years on the unit for which I paid $150, not to mention the replacement heads that cost about 40 per year, so we are talking about $270 for 3 years thats $90/Year. I would recommend buying a toothbrush (of course not Philips)  whose battery could be replaced and is more economical.</li>
    <li> Once you go Sonicare you never go back. I love purchasing mine on Amazon for the competitive price and an as a Prime member, 2 day shipping. The quality of the mouth cleaning is parallel to a dentist visit. This model in particular lets you select from a variety of brush speeds and pulses to help you gums or gently massage sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> makes teeth feel fresh and clean.i started using electronic toothbrushes a decade ago when i got braces on my teeth..ive stuck with philips sonicare brushes every time i needed to purchase one.</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast and I would never go back to a regular toothbrush.  I feel that the diamond clean would be a waste, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it is supposedly best for the battery to not continuously leave it on the charger.</li>
    <li> Like many others have said, the toothbrush does in fact do a great job cleaning. However, after 7+ years of using Sonicare toothbrushes I have had to replace them consistently just about every year; it&#x27;s like these things are engineered to fail just after warranty. Usually it&#x27;s the battery that goes, but this last time somehow the vibrating element became detached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it used to be that with some soldering skills you could replace the battery, but they got wise to that and have made it very difficult (I couldn&#x27;t do it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to Oral-B - have no idea if it&#x27;s better, but I&#x27;m tired of giving Phillips money.</li>
    <li> Works great then died after one year!!!!</li>
    <li> Over the years this is my third Sonicare.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Best dental checkups ever and I am in my late 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Dentist strongly recommended I get one of these to thwart a receding gum line .  The head it came with is sized perfectly to get around the molars.  My teeth feel smooth all day long ... Wish I&#x27;d bought one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an old Sonicare for at least 12 years, and figured it was time for an upgrade. Boy am I glad I did. The modes that can be selected, and the power it had verse my very old one is a huge difference. It holds a charge for about 2 weeks, when my old one was at about 5 days. My teeth just feel cleaner and I love the gym massage mode. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Super happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Feel like I just climbed out of the Dental Hygienist chair every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I was such a tight wad when it comes to my dental health was not very smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOKS like I could take some of my own advice and NOT outsmart my common sense.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works incredibly well.  It is gentle, yet thorough, and was recommended to me by my dentist. I highly recommend it!  It is worth the investment.  It is also easy to travel with and comes with a very convenient travel case.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare for about 5 years now and I just love it.  Makes my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth really well. A little too strong at the beginning. But now i got used of it and enjoy every time I uese it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good experience of freshness and cleanliness. I am happy to have bought this product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My wife bouight me this toothbrush last year and could never go back to a conventional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Using the Sonicare my teeth feel very smooth and my mouth feels fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought 3 for my kids for Christmas, they love it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just over two years ago, and was just informed by Philips that they can not help me, and that I should purchase a new toothbrush.  The issue with this toothbrush is quality of the manufacturing.  The spike that comes out of the top of the toothbrush, and holds the brush head in place is loose.  I&#x27;ll go back to my old Oral B, which is much older and much more reliable.  Poor warranty and poor customer service.</li>
    <li> Could not get the unit to recharge after two months of non use.  Called company and was told that some batteries go bad and is not covered after warranty.  When I opened the unit to take out the batteries for proper disposal, it looked as if the water seal did not hold up and there was leakage and corrosion inside. So the unit did not hold up in water.  Will be buying the electrical tooth brushes sold on the shelf as they work very well and are more economical to use.</li>
    <li> Broke after six months but Phillips warranty claim made it easy to get a new one on live chat.</li>
    <li> Feels like a dentist tool. I&#x27;ve studied to be a dentist and this tool provides better results than the competition oral b in the same make/model/price category. I own both and I&#x27;m glad to say the Sonicare outperforms.</li>
    <li> Great quality and the battery life is great. The trick is to run the battery dead so that the battery continues to hold a full charge for many years. I get around 4weeks of use on a full charge.</li>
    <li> Great product, replacing the old one my Wife &amp; I have worn out, it lasted three years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my toothbrush for just under 3 years, and absolutely loved it.  Last week it started vibrating very loudly, and a few days later the motor stopped working altogether.  After checking online, I was disappointed to see that I had exceeded the 24 month warranty period.  I then found an email in my inbox indicating that I had registered the product and figured I&#x27;d call Sonicare customer service to see what they could do.  The rep told me that the warranty is extended to 30 months for registered products.  So I was still out of warranty.  However she then said that since this was my first Sonicare toothbrush, they would go ahead and offer a one-time replacement for free (without warranty)!  Unfortunately they no longer make my old toothbrush (Elite 900, which looks just like the Flexcare Plus and may in fact be the same thing with a new name), so they will be sending me a Sonicare Essence.  A downgrade from my original toothbrush, but still better than buying a new one!</li>
    <li> First off I do want to say that when the toothbrush is working it is fantastic.  It really helped improve the health of my gums.  However, the problem with the brush is that it stopped working after about 5 months.  Philips did cover it under warranty and provided a replacement.  Unfortunately then the replacement had issue charging and stopped working after about a month or so.  I will get another Sonicare, but not a Flexcare Plus.  It&#x27;s a dud and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is noisy compared to earlier models, minus one star. The smaller brush heads are nice along with the options of cleaning modes. Takes some getting used to, you&#x27;ll press the &#x27;action&#x27; button many times before you learn not to put your thumb in the most obvious and comfortable place while holding.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this and I alternate use of it with a manual toothbrush.  I can definitely tell the difference - my teeth feel smoother and seem to be a little less sensitive the longer i use the Philips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I prefer the diamond care version. I&#x27;ll be returning this one and buying the diamond care again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and reliable but exactly same design as 10 years ago, ¿no improvements?</li>
    <li> You simply cannot do better for your teeth and gums than using a Sonicare on a regular basis...and I have been using one since their first model came out in 1992. Actually, my original Soniccare toothbrush has only JUST been retired, and only because I wanted to get a model that would travel with me. I highly recommend this, your mouth and your dentist will thank you!</li>
    <li> Did not receive what I ordered.  This toothbrush does not have multiple brushing functions.</li>
    <li> Teeth have never been cleaner!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product except that it died after three months of use. Now trying to get a refund. We could tolerate our previous Sonicare toothbrushes dying after a year or two, but a 3-month lifetime is unacceptable. Same problem has occurred in all cases - the motor vibrates normally but becomes mechanically disconnected from the metal bar that holds the brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve heard the ads for these units for years. Had no idea how effective they were at producing healthy gums.. I should&#x27;ve switched long ago. A pleasure to use. Well designed and made. Gums look brand new, like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Amazing appliance! Provides a very effective way to keep your teeth clean while maintaining healthy gums.&lt;br /&gt;Various brushing modes that let you adjust the brushing to your satisfaction.</li>
    <li> green button broke after 1 year of use.&lt;br /&gt;has a thin flimsy rubber coating that once broken, I could not repair.&lt;br /&gt;cheaper Sonicare model does not have this issue.</li>
    <li> Everything one could want in an electric toothbrush. My last one lasted six years of twice/day brushing.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Very lightweight and battery lasts forever unplugged.</li>
    <li> The Amazon description is accurate, in hindsight, (only comes with one standard brush head) but the Philips website (and other retailers) for the exact same model says it comes with a standard and a compact brush head, which was part of the reason I bought this model.  The lower price on Amazon was part of the reason I bought it here, but apparently it&#x27;s lower because I get less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different products with the same model number are a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about the product&#x27;s other merits, check the other reviews.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but I&#x27;m not starting out on the right foot.</li>
    <li> My dentist actually recommended this exact model to me. He said &amp;#34;get a Sonicare Flexcare Plus, that&#x27;s what I use.&amp;#34; I never actual heard a product endorsement from a dentist before. Anyway, I love this. I don&#x27;t know how I brushed my teeth before. It vibrates every 30 seconds, telling you to change. The head pops off super easily for convenient storage. The charging station is compact and light. The travel case is sturdy and useful. I like the different settings. The only thing I would add to this toothbrush is a vibration when you are pressing to hard. I know other toothbrushes have that feature, and I think it saves heads.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare series of rechargeable toothbrushes.  This is my fourth.  Replacement required at the end of the warranty period--no exceptions.</li>
    <li> It is what is in the product description, different modes and timer</li>
    <li> Sonicare Flexcare Plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, and I had been using Oral-B&#x27;s brush system since around 1996, but always knew about Sonicare. I didn&#x27;t realize how Sonicare really &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; the tooth brush 31,000 times a minute because I can certainly tell after using it. There are no mechanical moving parts with these brushes, the brush head just &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; rapidly causing the toothpaste/fluid mixture to agitate and flow through gum lines and in-between teeth, while the brush works gently and rapidly to remove stains/debris from the teeth. I watched YouTube videos demonstrating how to use the Diamond Clean Sonicare system, bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare after using it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B wasn’t bad, but it doesn’t feel “as clean” after using those brushes. The Oral-B system is similar to a random orbital buffer, where the brush head rotates back/forth rapidly. There are numerous Oral-B brushes but I always found myself using the Oral-B Sensitive and Precision clean, and never liked the Floss Action or Tri-Action heads. The brushes cleaned my teeth but it always felt like it was rather rough on my gums and teeth without being able to get into the deeper nooks/crannies. The Sonicare system seems (at least in my opinion) to agitate the fluid enough to allow it to clean other areas that a brush normally cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased compact Diamond Clean heads after extensively researching Sonicare&#x27;s confusing line of brush heads, before I actually bought a Sonicare toothbrush. I noticed the Diamond Clean was the most expensive but highly rated tooth brush available, with 7x the cleaning power. I was curious to see what differences (if any) there were with the actual Diamond Clean tooth brush versus a less expensive model such as the Essence or Flexcare series. I quickly found that most of these brush heads are compatible with the Flexcare and Diamond Clean, with the Essence being a low-budget line. There didn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in performance between the Flexcare Plus or the Diamond Clean, so I ordered and received the Flexcare, and used the compact Diamond Head brush for my teeth. The Diamond Clean seemed to just have a fancy USB-charger for the travel case and a fancy rinsing glass/charger base, and would come with full-sized Diamond Clean heads. There’s nothing wrong, but it was substantially more expensive than the Flexcare Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Plus comes with a single full-sized ProResults brush, which I felt was too big and I didn&#x27;t like the feel. The compact Diamond Clean has a much higher bristle density, with lots of tiny bristles packed into an area for maximum cleaning. The smaller size allowed me to focus on tight spots as well as cover the larger surface areas (flat parts of teeth, biting surfaces, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Plus comes with a charger base that also includes a travel charger with a base that you can wrap the power cord around. The Flexcare Plus utilizes a Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery pack, that should be good for at least 2-5 years. I would have preferred a Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery because they have a longer lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Plus is quieter than the Oral-B Triumph and Precision Care series brushes. It’s basically the same difference between using an electric hair trimmer with and without the attachment installed: a high frequency mosquito “buzz” (Sonicare) versus mechanical parts moving back/forth rapidly (Oral-B). If I accidentally touch my tongue or lip on the Sonicare brush head, it sort of feels tingly due to the vibration from the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, I am very impressed with Sonicare! There are no moving parts on the brush head, it relies on high frequency “vibration” of the head which results in a brushing action as well as agitates the toothpaste/fluid to clean your gums and teeth. Since I’ve already been using Oral-B for over 15 years, I am not new to electric toothbrushes and didn’t have any problems adjusting to Sonicare immediately. I will keep comparing the Sonicare with my Oral-B Triumph in the near term, but would highly recommend you try a compact Sonicare brush head for more control and precision, similar to the smaller Oral-B heads.5 years, I am not new to electric toothbrushes and didn’t have any problems adjusting to Sonicare immediately.

    <li> My dental hygienist told me that I should get a Sonicare, and I told her I would.  Went on Amazon, was a little shocked by the cost of all Sonicare products (I&#x27;ve had other, cheaper electric toothbrushes), but decided to take the plunge.  Bottomline is that it works as advertised, and I think makes a huge difference.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It cleans teeth well.  It is simple and easy to use.  Has a 30 second timer for each quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Due to the vibrating mechanism, if the brush hits other teeth while brushing, it is annoying as well.  For that I find it difficult to keep my mouth closed and tooth paste leaks out of my mouth all the time.  I wish there was a pause button.  So if I want to spit the toothpaste, then I can pause it then resume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am not sure if I would get this product again.  I would try the Oral B product before trying this product again.</li>
    <li> I appreciated the stress free packaging. I have arthritis in my hands and the packaging was a breeze to open. The toothbrush cost me over $100 less than when I bought my last one (identical from another seller). It makes my teeth feel clean as when the dentist cleans them. I love this toothbrush especially for the gentle options for my sensitive gums. A great deal on a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected.  Good value.  We received the item quickly.</li>
    <li> Had Phillips actually sent this model I would be absolutely thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;They sent the correct box, instructions, and accessories but the model wasn&#x27;t correct.&lt;br /&gt;The same can be said of the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Someone at Phillips has a unique retirement plan I suspect.&lt;br /&gt;Off to Costco I go!</li>
    <li> Just like the dentist.  This is one of the products that you buy and never look back.  It is pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Much better than braun, I am thinking to switch my braun shaver to philips too.</li>
    <li> In September 2006 I bought this old model for my son and I. We are still using this one when I know people with the newer models have replaced theirs and they do not clean as well as this model. I am buying this brush in hopes they send me the older model.</li>
    <li> This brush leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> Wow! This Sonicare is amazing. It has my teeth the cleanest i can remember.</li>
    <li> After decades away from the electric toothbrush, I am back.  They have come a long way in that time, and this toothbrush really gets the job done.  My teeth are cleaner and more tartar-free than any time in recent memory.  Furthermore, the battery held its charge for the duration of a ten-day trip recently for two people.  Impressive!  I must say that we do not use all the functions, but I do find the Refresh and Gum settings useful as well as the primary Clean.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product  I&#x27;ve owned one for many years.</li>
    <li> Same as the original. Not a knock off version. Happy customer for 5 yrs. my teeth are clear of plaque and gingival is stipple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sonicare for years. However they only last me two years or so. My original one died 1.5 years of use and Philips replaced it. The replacement then lasted a little under two years and broke with the same cause. The metal rod that transfers the ultrasonic vibration breaks inside the unit. This prevents the brush tip from vibrating 100%. I contacted Philips and said they wouldn&#x27;t help me because the original unit was out warranty, even though my replacement unit was still inside the two years from the replacement date. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one as for $120 I expect a longer lifespan especially since the issue reoccured twice.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush!</li>
    <li> excellent brush and light weight and thin.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I use an electric toothbrush since I was developing gingivitis. I&#x27;ve used the toothbrush for 4 months now and notice a considerable difference in plaque build up (if any!). My teeth feel 10x cleaner using it compared to a manual handbrush. It comes with two settings to allow you to get used to using it, and then has multiple settings for cleaning and gum care. There is also a timer option, which is really helpful to prevent rushing, and even has intermittent beeps to let you know to switch to a different spot. I brush my teeth approximately 3 times a day, and the battery lasts a week and a half before I have to charge it again, and I charge it overnight. It is not loud like some reviewers have complained about. The original package only came with one brush head, so I had to buy a replacement pack. They recommend you change the brush heads every 3 months, but mine looked brand new even after 3 months of using it (the bristles didn&#x27;t get destroyed like they would on a manual). I would highly recommend this for any customer looking to switch / start using an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Cleans teeth well. Easy to use. Retains charge for days. Travel case is very helpful. Removes tartar and food well.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare lasted almost 8 years and when I replaced it with this one, it seems almost silent by comparison! I don&#x27;t remember if my old one was this quiet when I first bought it, but this is a great toothbrush and it leaves my teeth feeling really clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that have never used a sonicare, the one thing that you need to get used to is to not touch the non-brush side to teeth, as it makes for an unpleasant feeling. That said, once you understand this and avoid it, it is far superior in experience to the mechanical toothbrushes that swirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being my second Sonicare in almost a decade, I think I will use these toothbrushes for the rest of my life. Hopefully this one will last as long as the previous one!</li>
    <li> I love It ! Always had gum problems. Never again had problems after using this. Worth every penny. Ur teeth are kida important you know ...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wondering, they&#x27;re the same toothbrush. The /30 is sold directly by Amazon, in their &amp;#34;frustration free packaging.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Sonicare. We&#x27;re replacing a 3-year old one of the same style that gradually died. It didn&#x27;t peter out the way our Oral-B&#x27;s have in the past -- no, the Sonicare seemed to be running strong, but I was noticing it wasn&#x27;t vibrating as energetically. It&#x27;s almost as if it turned into a manual toothbrush attached to a noisemaker. Almost like an old ultrasonic cleaner I owned that vibrated, but didn&#x27;t really get anything clean. So be aware of that before a cavity sneaks in on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not complaining, though. My wife and I use this toothbrush interchangeably with an Oral B, and one of our sons uses it exclusively, so we&#x27;ve gotten our value out of it with cavity-free checkups. And while I prefer the Oral B for superior manual action, the Sonicare gets the nod for getting down into my gums and giving my teeth that &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; feeling. Alternating between the two (plus flossing and mouth wash -- no way around that) seems like a good cavity-free tactic that I&#x27;ll stick with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare&#x27;s one complaint from my wife is that it tickles or stings -- something she&#x27;s learned to deal with, but also something she&#x27;s become reacquainted with after replacing the old, poorly-working unit.</li>
    <li> Dentist said it was necessary, so i bought it for less on Amazon! Does a thorough job, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for a long time now and upgraded to this one once the precious one died after about 3 1/2 years of use. It holds great charge and does a great job on cleaning. I get complements when i visit the dentist.</li>
    <li> The is my second Sonicare.  The first lasted 4+ years and I am hoping for similar results with this new Sonicare.  So far so good...this is a good product!  Easy to use and it does a very good job.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have had the Oral-B electric toothbrush for some time but really did not notice a major difference from a regular toothbrush.  The Sonicare truly makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist every time!  I wish I would have bought this years ago!!  For the first time ever, I actually enjoy brushing my teeth.  I did not expect to use the various settings but they have ended up being great for a quick refresh or a sensitive gum. The price was significantly lower than other retailers and it arrived very quickly.  Overall, highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for about as long as they&#x27;ve been around (about 20 years) ever since my dentist introduced me to them and I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a regular toothbrush again. This is my fourth Sonicare, which I bought as a replacement for an identical model that died after five years of daily use. Nothing else gets my mouth and teeth as clean as this does.</li>
    <li> Good version, love the different options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the older version but let the battery drain and now it&#x27;s dead- so...  never let your battery drain because these are lithium and die if they drop below a certain voltage charge.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! My dentist recommended it. His hygienist could see that I did a much better job cleaning my teeth. My gums are in fine shape. Adding flossing also that means less dental work in my opinion. Expensive toothbrushes though. BEWARE: buy toothbrushes at Costco. Sadly, my last purchase of toothbrushes at Amazon were fakes.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to a smaller more modern toothbrush to replace an older Sonic that was still going strong after many years of service.  This one gives options that I appreciate, like a refresh  for a quick brushing or gum care that gives 4 timed tooth brush steps, followed buy 4 gum brushing timed stages.  It is light weight and narrower than the old.  I&#x27;m not sure it holds the charge as long as my old but that may be because I use it more often and for longer brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years it stopped working and my 5 star rating goes to 1 star with all the other disappointed users.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law and they both loved it. They picked out the brand and style they wanted and they are very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several sonacare brushes in the past but this one is by far the best designed for comfort and function.</li>
    <li> Once you go sonicare, you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> Sonicare quality just keeps getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical in buying a new Sonicare toothbrush as I had used the old model (some call it the original) from about 7 years ago. I had just bought replacement heads for it and it worked well. Well, it stopped holding a charge and I was on the lookout for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s lighter and looks more vibrant than the model I had. The &amp;#34;process&amp;#34; cleaning is a much better application of technology rather then just a timer that has an on/off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent purchase and I highly recommend it for those that want the power of what an electric toothbrush does with the quality Sonicare provides.</li>
    <li> Excellent, powerful toothbrush. It leaves my teeth feeling very clean.  This model has more plastic parts than it does rubbery parts which I appreciate but I found the rubbery parts to develop mildew overtime.</li>
    <li> Have a very nice experience using it past couple of months .No issues so far .</li>
    <li> The product performs just as I expected, and in fact exceeds expectations, because I didn&#x27;t know that it had different modes (cleaning, gum care, etc.) that one can choose from.</li>
    <li> Decided to purchase the newer model of the Philips Sonicare HX6921/30.  My older model last years and years.  This newer model lasted only 1.5 years.  $130 + cost of heads to last just a year and a half?  Sadly I just through out my old model and now need to find something else.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always thought sonic toothbrushes were silly bit my dentist kept telling me to give it a try, so I did. Now I&#x27;m hooked, its amazing how clean my teeth feel</li>
    <li> Exactly the efficiency  I was looking for! Product is as stated in description. I would most certainly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife. Not sure why the brush head keeps popping off when she brushes her teeth. It a not very well made. I looked online, seems like this is a common issue. Would not have thought I would have to beware of a product with so much fanfair.</li>
    <li> I started using an electric/battery operated toothbrush about 2 years ago. I started off with a $12 rechargeable Oral-B from Target. It lasted about a year before the handle cracked and the unit died. I then went to a battery operated $20 Oral-B. It lasted until the batteries need to be replaced, then it also died. Decided it was time to go upscale. After considerable research, decided to give this on a try. What a difference. My teeth are noticeable cleaner. The unit itself is lighter and much more ergonomic than the cheap brushes I had been using. Yes, it is expensive but I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> these electric brushes are designed to failed after 2 years. me and my wife had 2 of these toothbrush fail at different times within 2 years. My tooth brush failed within the 2 year warranty date and the representative insist on me producing a receipt from almost 2 years ago and says it is easy to goto the retailer and get a copy. When I could not find that for their validation process, I was offered 15% at their website to purchase another one at $150+. Stay away or if you have to purchase one, remember to keep the receipt for the warranty validation process. They definitely don&#x27;t build them to last like before.</li>
    <li> As advertised, Good shipping</li>
    <li> Great unit, great price. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 6 months and just purchased this one for my wife.  My teeth and entire mouth have never felt cleaner after brushing.  The charge lasts several days and comes with a great travel/storage box.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She’s been wanting one for some time now. Recently we went on a weekend trip and she took her old Spinbrush and couldn’t wait to back to using this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a previous Oral B sonic complete user. I like the Oral B brushes better. The Sonicare brush heads are very small. We&#x27;ll see at my next checkup how that works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the 2.5 year warranty. The Oral B batteries failed often and I replaced them several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare is smaller and fits my small hands better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main reason for the 4 rating is that Amazon.com recommends buying a travel case, but one is included. Do buy extra brush heads as only 1 is included.</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush! Easy to use, charge lasts a long time. Don&#x27;t really use all the other modes besides cleaning but nice to know they exist!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush, while it lasts.  I got about 3 years out of mine, and my teeth felt great while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years of use, the battery stopped holding as much charge, until it would no longer charge at all, and I was left with an expensive piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer who likes to repair things when possible, so I looked online for some instructions and supplies to replace the battery.  Upon disassembling the toothbrush, it is clearly evident that Philips designed the one easy replaceable part to be irreplaceable.  They soldered the battery to the circuit board, when it is completely unnecessary to do so.  By doing this, when the battery dies, so does the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This engineering decision was completely intentional.  It might have saved a cent per assembly, or maybe even added a cent in labor cost; however its goal remains the same: to force the user to discard the entire toothbrush and buy a new one when the battery dies (typically within 2 years).  When you buy this toothbrush, you are supporting a company that puts the environment second, and profits first, at least in the case of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced my dead Sonicare with a competitor&#x27;s product which features a replaceable battery.  Save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t buy this one in the first place.</li>
    <li> Should have changed years ago.  Gum health improved in less than two weeks.  Great investment and know my dentist who recommended this will be happy.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel much cleaner than after brushing with a manual toothbrush. Easy to use and holds a charge for a long time. I appreciated the inclusion of a small plastic cover for the brush. Looking forward to learning more about how it affects long term tooth health.</li>
    <li> It has been awesome so far! I love it! Good feeling and I really feel I have cleaner teeth. I ordered this over the Oral B one, who knows why. I guess I read better reviews on this one - however I&#x27;m glad I got this one. It holds a great charge, easy on the gums, and has a good timer. I am using the GUM CARE setting and it has settings every 30 secs. It doesn&#x27;t beep as people say (or complain about). It will stop vibrating for like half a second, then start again. This helps to stay on the 2 min schedule.</li>
    <li> Really not happy with this one. Sonacare toothbrush arrived in a plain brown box as you would expect a refurb item to be packaged. Item ad shows regular retail packaging in photos and description. They are great toothbrushes, I just don&#x27;t want a used one.</li>
    <li> Best product out there</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for one that was dropped and broke.  It meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> love these takes a little time to get used to it. wont be without one now.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this expensive toothbrush but after reading other reviews, I decided to try it out because I want to take good care of my teeth. It does take about a week to get used to the ticklish feeling you get from using it. Once you get past that, this is an amazing toothbrush that thoroughly cleans your mouth and leaves it feeling like you just left the dentist.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  This replaces my S series that was very old and the battery no longer maintained a charge for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an Oral-B electric brush but this one is so much better. I no longer have issues with my gums and I love the travel case that came with the brush. Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that Philips purposely engineers their toothbrushes to crap out with no chance of fixing them yourself or replacing the battery shortly after the warranty expires - you pretty much have to go buy a brand new toothbrush 1-2 years later. For the price point, that is NOT acceptable by any means, which is why I implore you: REGISTER THE TOOTHBRUSH AS SOON AS YOU GET IT!! You will have a much easier time getting your product RMA&#x27;d if need be, and you will have documentation to back up your claims, so customer service will be much more likely to help you. Also, doing so extends your mfctr warranty by 6 months, so it becomes a 2.5-year warranty. I had a DiamondClean years ago which broke 1 month after the 2-year warranty expired (how convenient!) and was hesitant to go back to Philips. That being said, the Flexcare Plus is just FANTASTIC. The battery life alone is amazing - I received it a week ago with 3/4 battery charge, been using it twice a day since then and still has two bars left, have yet to fully charge it. I was previously using an Oral-B Deep Sweep $25 rechargeable brush from CVS; charging took 16 hours and only gave you 1.5 weeks of use at most, and while it did a good job cleaning my teeth, it rattled my entire skull! The Sonicare lineup in that aspect is awesome - very intense but super-precise sonic vibrations, so it does not rattle your head while brushing. My teeth feel amazingly smooth and clean all day/night into the next morning, and does a good job massaging your gums. I also like that it flexes to get around the sides of your back-most teeth, which I have always had a hard time cleaning. Wish it came with a UV cleaner, but I&#x27;m very satisfied nonetheless. My teeth are at least 5 shades whiter, and it has also lessened the brown plaque lines I have between my teeth (GROSS!!) from all the coffee I drink each morning. Thumbs up all around! I will update again should anything change, or break...</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush when it performs, but I&#x27;ve gone through two in the last two years. They just died. (The second one, before dying, turned itself on in the middle of the night and couldn&#x27;t be turned off. That was fun.) I&#x27;ll probably still buy a Sonicare but I&#x27;m going to buy a less expensive one, since reliability is clearly an issue.</li>
    <li> This is a precision instrument that we can&#x27;t do without.  We like taking care of the teeth we have and this Philips Sonicare is the best we have used. ....believe me we have gone through a few &#x27;electric toothbrushes&#x27; in our day.  I believe you will be just as pleased with it as we are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used oral-B products for several years, but i believe this brush is doing a better job on my teeth. Currently, i have both brushes in use, but the flexcare plus is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush for a real clean!! Never going back to manual or spin brush!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price. I had my last one for 4 years.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great, very well made toothbrush.  Much better than an older model I used previously that needed to be recharged every three or four days.  I took this new one with me on a recent trip to Europe, and didn&#x27;t need to charge it.  This one has a comfortable handle and some nice features.</li>
    <li> This is our second Sonicare unit and we absolutely love it. &#x27;nuf said.</li>
    <li> This will be the third Sonicare HX692 toothbrush that I have purchased.  Every couple of years, the brush simply stops functioning, stops holding any charge whatsoever.  Obviously, I like the toothbrush or I would not continue to repurchase such an expensive item.  My rationale is that even with the short lifespan, the brush costs less than a trip to the dentist.  BUT all the same, such a high end product should not wear out so quickly.  It might even be wearing out within the warranty period, but it is so hard to keep track.</li>
    <li> I am very, very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve used a regular brush my whole life. Then, my hygienist explained what I was missing, and why. So I tried the Philips Sonicare (HX6921/02). My teeth, gums and mouth actually feel cleaner... it is noticeably different. I find there are some places where the sonic/vibrations can be overly &#x27;ticklish&#x27;. Fortunately, this sonicare has a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting which adequately takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Christmas shopping will be easier this year. I think I will giving these out to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have been a sonic toothbrush user since I was a teenager, when the cybersonic 2 came out. We bought a couple of them, I lost mine. However my moms is still working and its like 20 years old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists have always been very happy with the lack of tarter and cavities on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Eventually, I got a flexcare. Which lasted just under 1 year before it just stopped working/charging. Philips replaced it in warranty, and exactly one year and 2 days later that one had something in it break where it would turn on and make noise, but it wouldnt brush on its own. Sigh. I&#x27;ve always babied it, and didnt drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another huge issue, is cleaning/debris that gets on the toothbrush. If you dont clean the whole thing very well every other brushing (think, nooks &amp; cranies of the charging area, and where the toothbrush attaches) it gets gross and stinky. ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it does, nothing else considered, Id give it 5 stars. Due to longevity and price - I&#x27;d give it 2 stars so I had to settle somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the EasyClean version now. If it only lasts a year or two its not such a big deal on price.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!  Love you can really take care of your gums with this and the actions of the brush bring your teeth to a whole new level of clean.  Had the brush a couple months now and still impressed with the charge life of the battery.</li>
    <li> AWESOME.. Really does make a difference over the standard electric toothbrush.  and yes, it WILL whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> An electric toothbrush is new to me. My hygienist recommended that I use one so I bought this one thinking that it might save me the cost of some extra cleanings to keep periodontal visits to a minimum. What I found using it was that my mouth felt very refreshed and that I actually appreciate spending a full 2 minutes (or more) cleaning and stimulating my teeth and gums. I never really thought to use one before because none of my dentists or hygienists over the years recommended that I use one. I simply used the toothbrushes they gave me whenever I visited them. As a result I thought electric ones were simply gadgets. This is not a gadget. It&#x27;s almost like bringing an ultrasonic cleaner to your teeth and I know how well they work. If you plan on keeping your teeth for a while this is one investment in them that will return plenty on you investment.</li>
    <li> After needing LANAP gum surgery my Periodontist recommended I use a Sonicare toothbrush. I was skeptical at first but after using this for a few months I feel it&#x27;s far superior to the two Oral Bs I had been using over the years. It cleans my teeth quickly with less effort and harm to my gums. I wish I had purchased a Sonicare originally!</li>
    <li> REALLY good electric toothbrush!  I hesitated to spend this much money, but have thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of really cleaning my teeth well. It took only a little while to get used to....my mouth vibrated a little after the first use, but that feeling wore off quickly. Now I wouldn&#x27;t be without this aid to good dental health. I appreciate the different settings, but find I use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting almost always. I don&#x27;t think I ever brushed my teeth for two minutes at a time before I bought this brush....the quad pacer is a great help in getting to all parts of your teeth. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> After one week it felt like I&#x27;d just had a cleaning at the dentist. Just had my cleaning and the hygienist could barely find anything to scrape. Improved my oral health and teeth feel so clean.</li>
    <li> so far I LOVE IT  full disclosure this is my first electric toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too but I will say I have had mine for a month and I am hooked  I got mine on cyber Monday so I got a great price and free delivery. I love the timer option and the different cycle choices. clean, healthy gums, etc.....  I read a few review before I purchased this one and for me the complaint that it only lasts about two years is something I am a little concerned about but all and all I would say this was a great purchase and I got a fantastic deal on it.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is still the best electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush!  My previous Sonicare toothbrush died in mid-brush.  I needed a new one ASAP.  Found this one on sale.  Love the new head style and charger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a old dog; my dental hygienists were unable to convert me to modern habits that my grandkids take for granted. My first electric toothbrush was an Ora-B (also sold on Amazon) with a round bristle shape, but I never got into using it regularly and returned to manual toothbrushes. I finally tried this Sonicare, and was immediately hooked. I find it easier to clean around my wisdom teeth (I have all four!) way in the back, and my mouth feels very clean afterwards. Great product.</li>
    <li> great product helps with gum issues and cleans teeth very well</li>
    <li> The good news is that this is a great toothbrush.  The best, in fact.  However, it does not work for very long.  The motor on mine began disengaging first periodically, then permanently.  It would buzz but not vibrate and was thus useless.  Philips RMA&#x27;ed it for me on 10/1/13 and the replacement has since died with the same exact issue.  Now that I am trying to RMA it again, less than a year from receiving a brand new unit (not a refurb), they refuse to replace it because the warranty period applies to the first defective unit, not the BRAND NEW ONE they sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service left a bit to be desired, as when I asked to appeal this they said &amp;#34;My supervisor would tell you the same thing. Matter of fact, you can chat again and talk to another person you’d get the same answer. I just want to save you time here.&amp;#34;  Their consolation prize is 15% off a new full price unit.  I am sorry, but paying $100+ for a toothbrush more frequently than once a year is totally unacceptable.  I would never buy anything from Philips again.  I expected a lot more from a five-star toothbrush and expected this company to back their products, particularly not even half way through the standard warranty period, regardless of when the original purchase took place.  Absolutely shameful.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush. For me, it&#x27;s much better than the old way plus there&#x27;s a timer that let&#x27;s you know when to move to the next quadrant. The batteries last for over a week so there is no need to pack the charger for short visits. I have found the cheapest replacement brush heads on eBay.</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Not really using the different modes, but my teeth feel so clean!  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for over 10 years, this is my third one.  Really feel like they last and last, brush heads can be spendy, they have them at warehouse store a lot for a decent deal.</li>
    <li> Easily one of the greatest investments I have purchased off of Amazon. This cleans better then my Oral-B 360 toothbrush by 10x with less time.</li>
    <li> I had one that died, so this is my dentist-recommended replacement.</li>
    <li> Has many speeds and functions.  Works very well not only to clean my teeth, but also to massage my gums.  I just learned that my dentist recommends it.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoyed  my Philips sonic care toothbrush and got good results until my husband started using it as well. I guess the toothbrush is not designed to have the brushes switched  when you want to share the appliance. As a result,the toothbrush cuts out,has weak rotation/ vibration and just doesn&#x27;t do the job,after just 1 1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the Phillips company and was told that without my receipt, they would not replace or repair my toothbrush. I am very disappointed,especially since I told them that it was a gift and I never received a receipt. I also registered the toothbrush but they claimed they couldn&#x27;t find the registration,I placed online.&lt;br /&gt;So, in a nutshell....... The toothbrush is good as long as you don&#x27;t switch the heads much and customer service is awful!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the one I used for years. Produces great checkups&lt;br /&gt;I like the no frills and no plastic packaging and saved money to boot.</li>
    <li> Awesome product Its a upgrade from the old sonicare The old one lasted 6 years thought about  changing the batteries and get it going again But Its  time  Tech improves the new Flex quite a bit</li>
    <li> The first unit I purchased was July 13th, 2012.  On March 6th, 2014 the handle started vibrating randomly by itself with no button presses from me.  After a week it failed and no longer held a charge.  In fact when placing the handle on the chargers the green battery light did not even turn on.  I received a replacement unit on a week after.  The replacement handle exhibited the same symptoms as the first one and now will not hold a charge as of June 26th, 2014.  I&#x27;m 2/2 for failed handles that were not dropped or damaged.  Philips Warranty starts from the original purchase date of the first handle so they will not be sending me a new handle.  They offered me a 15% discount and free shipping through their online store.  At the rate I&#x27;m going I would need to purchase a new Sonicare every 1.5 years at a cost of $100.00 plus the cost of the replacement brush heads.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in Philips Quality Control as well as their support.  I&#x27;ll be spending my money with Oral B and not recommending Sonicare anymore.</li>
    <li> I love her smile  Buy it and you will be happy</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my Sonicare Elite, which lasted over 10 years. The Flexcare is equally good, with some extra settings too. It is lighter and more slender than the Elite - so far I&#x27;m enjoying it. The replacement brush heads are not quite as complicated as the Elite, so they are cheaper and easier to find.  I hope it lasts as long as my Elite.</li>
    <li> a little pricey but gets the job done.I would tell anyone who is interested in their dental health to purchase one.</li>
    <li> I have been skeptical about the whole electronic toothbrush thing for years, but as I get older my teeth aren&#x27;t what they used to be. I have a few cavities and my dentist said they were so small that she wanted to wait on drilling until they got bigger, maybe a few years from now. I thought I might be able to make it a few more years with better brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t recommend I buy an electronic toothbrush, but she had one in her office just sitting there. She was so gentle with my cleaning, I thought that maybe picking one up on my own will help me brush better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked one up and I am glad I did. It doesn&#x27;t come in a retail box though. The brush is in a special cardboard Amazon box, which is fine, it just through me for a loop. &amp;#34;Did I buy a used toothbrush?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I paid around $130 for this toothbrush. The warranty only lasted 12 months. I cannot afford to keep buying this high end piece of oral hygiene equipment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare for about 8 years but it was time to get a new one. My old one quit holding it&#x27;s charge. This one is lovely. Nice updates from my old one. Love the timer feature for switching quadrants &amp; the smaller charger. Also like that this one doesn&#x27;t have the larger compartment holding the brush that you need to clean all the time. By only attaching the brush itself it&#x27;s a cleaner arrangement. Nice sleek design &amp; love getting the Fantastic reports on my teeth &amp; gum health from my hygienist.</li>
    <li> This brush has greatly increased my ability to clean my teeth and it is fun to use. The built in timer is quite helpful.</li>
    <li> Ordered the HX6921/30 for a hefty price but was sent the HD6950 which is the same, older, less expensive model that I had used, stopped working after a year, replaced under warranty and broke again.  Noticed some other commenters had the same experience with no adequate explanation.</li>
    <li> I like this model a lot. It feels funny in your mouth at first, from all the pulsating, but really delivers a cleaning that you can&#x27;t achieve with a traditional toothbrush. Helped enormously to reverse the pregnancy-induced gingivitis I developed. No problems since! I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, came as promised.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush so far!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE CLEANING OPTIONS, WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush. I was skeptical about this, but am glad I bought it. It tickles at first, but after a couple uses, I didn&#x27;t even notice it. I&#x27;m brushing my teeth more and longer due to the built in timer. Highly Recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare Flexcare unit, and the second to come apart after a year of use:  the last one&#x27;s non-serviceable battery died; this one&#x27;s motor shaft wore out.  Interesting to compare this product with my 20-year-old Braun professional unit. Now I know why it&#x27;s heavier:  unlike the Sonicare, it&#x27;s built to last.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush helps keep my gums healthy and my teeth clean. Basically the phillips sonicare does the job for you. However I do need to brush my teeth a little longer than the two minute timer that it has. In order to get to all the areas that need brushing it is more of a 3 minute brush.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare. This was a replacement for my previous handle which quit charging after 5 years of use. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> works better than advertised.really like the way  it performs......</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to use and has many features on it which are exactly as described. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> work well. i&#x27;m glad i bought this toothbrush. Amazon does have a really good price on this item. look everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find any better price.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift. My friend loves the brush and uses it daily. They have no complaints.</li>
    <li> As always, another fantastic Sonicare product. An upgrade from my previous E-series and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing. Would recommend to all!</li>
    <li> We started using this unit at Christmas and could feel instant results  with cleaner teeth and fresher mouth!&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienist which I visited in mid-Jan even noticed the improvement with less plaque.</li>
    <li> Cleans thoroughly and reaches into tricky back of jaw areas, but vibrates with a jarring jolt if the non-bristle part of the brush head hits my teeth which inevitably happens. My dentist recommended this model of Sonicare for sensitive and/or receding gums. I agree that it gently cleans - as long as you don&#x27;t zap yourself!</li>
    <li> I love my new electric toothbrush! First of all, it arrived several days earlier than expected, which is always a pleasant surprise. I was replacing an older electric toothbrush that was a different brand. My dentist recommended this one and I love all the features it includes. It comes in a great carrying case for travel, which I do a lot, and am actually writing this review from Panama. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This was my second flex and it works every well.  Several speed options and clean very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like this so much better than my battery operated unit.  It stops running after two minutes, which is good.  Has 5 different settings so you can clean your teeth and gums, etc.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Love the two minute timer that lets me know that I am done.  Very pleased with this purchase as I am sure my dental hygienist will be as well!</li>
    <li> Just recieved this great toothbrush to replace an older one and wow it arrived in a flash on a Sunday no less. Who delivers in a Sunday? Nevertheless it&#x27; here with me and sofar so good no complaints!</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare for years before it finally broke. I used a manual toothbrush for a few months. my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all, so finally I broke down and bought a new Sonicare. My teeth finally feel squeaky clean again!</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of time to get used to it, but once you have, you&#x27;ll notice the difference.  It even makes flossing your teeth easier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I had an electric toothbrush and I treated myself before Christmas. So glad I did! Not only is this particular model lightweight and slick, it has many cleaning functions. While traveling for almost 2 weeks, the battery lights are still registering great power and nothing has changed pertaining to functionality. My teeth and gums are smooth and clear all the time. Best part of the toothbrush: the timer feature that alerts you to clean another section of your mouth. If you purchase this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The picture on the website did not match the item I received. The replacement item did not match the picture either. Returned all for credit.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush 3 months ago, simply amazing!  My teeth feel more clean and I really like the timer, helps me stay honest and not just brush my teeth for a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to buy them for my family for their birthdays I hope they will like them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I had sensitive and inflammed gums after a little mono outbreak and this is working great on the gum setting.</li>
    <li> over priced.. .greta toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve got one and bought this for my wife. The best on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, just louder than my previous Sonicare</li>
    <li> First electric toothbrush and i&#x27;m never going back! My teeth were visibly whiter within only a week of using this toothbrush. Love the timer although the different modes seem pretty superfluous to me-I rarely use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 5-year-old Sonicare Series 2 toothbrush, which was still serviceable but could no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days. This new one is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model runs more quietly, it&#x27;s lighter and thinner, it&#x27;s compatible with a larger selection of toothbrush heads that are better designed and use less landfill-filling plastic. My old model used the screw-on type of heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model also has a battery indicator light, a sleek, well-crafted charger base, and a compact carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium-ion battery holds a charge for a very long time, and is part of why this model costs so much and is so light, slim and quiet. As long as this toothbrush lasts anywhere near as long as my old one did, I&#x27;m happy to have paid the premium price for everything this model has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case is made of molded plastic, and I imagine that after a bit of use it will probably fall apart, but they can be bought on Amazon for around $10, so I&#x27;m not worried about that. The toothbrush&#x27;s several modes are useless to me; I just use it to brush my teeth, at full speed with the quad-timer. But for that it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews by people complaining that some Sonicare models force them to cycle through all the useless modes when turning off the device. That does not happen with this model. The switch turns it on, then turns it off, simply. The different modes are selected using a separate switch. This model also does not shut off automatically after the 2 minutes, which I appreciate because sometimes I want to brush for a little bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution about the product listing: The product description says this model comes with a charger AND a travel charger. This is not exactly accurate. The travel charger is a minimalist little charger that fits inside of a larger plastic base, which otherwise is hollow. The &amp;#34;non-travel&amp;#34; charger is just the travel charger with an extra plastic covering that has a larger surface with pegs to store a couple of extra toothbrush heads and a space to wind the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sharing this with someone and expect to have two complete chargers, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. When you take the travel charger on a trip, what&#x27;s left behind is a useless shell that cannot be used to charge anything. So if you leave town for a few weeks and take the travel charger with you, the person staying home with whom you&#x27;ve been sharing will have no way to charge her toothbrush until you return.l charger with an extra plastic covering that has a larger surface with pegs to store a couple of extra toothbrush heads and a space to wind the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sharing this with someone and expect to have two complete chargers, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.

    <li> It works great and is fast.  Teeth feel really clean after just 1 minute.  I wish I bought one years ago!</li>
    <li> Cheaper alternative to the diamond.  The lighting is so slick, i impressed people with it.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The feeling takes some getting used to.  It initially feels rather tickle-y.  But after less than a week, I don&#x27;t notice it any more.  My husband commented that it made his teeth feel cleaner than using another electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love the clean feeling my teeth have after using my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush. The gum care feature feel great too! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome-best buy ever in a toothbrush-my teeth feel like I just went to the dentist! My husband and I share-we just switch brush heads.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about this toothbrush.  It does everything I asked for.  Keeps my teeth clean and keeps the dentist happy.  I have and will keep recommending this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, my teeth are more clean, and I love the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend to anyone that wants a good electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> simply the best. I lost my first Sonicare when I was traveling out of the country. I missed it so much I didn&#x27;t mind spending the money again. It feels like your mouth is getting a massage. The cycle timer is a nice feature, I find myself doing two or three cycles because I like brushing so much with this. get one, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. My teeth &amp; gums are healthier as noted in my dental chart. Experiencing the &amp;#34;fresh &amp; clean&amp;#34; mouth you use to get from the dentist visit is a great feeling I now have on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;Deb in Delaware</li>
    <li> Have used a Rotodent for 15 yrs, but it was slowly dying. Tried to find a replacement Rotodent but could not find a dentist that sold them. Asked my peridontist for a recommendation. He is the one who recommended Rotodent. He now uses Sonicare Flexcare and said to use the smallest head available. Got the Sonicare and a package of small heads. First time I tried the Sonicare, I was startled at the amount of vibration. I did my teeth quickly and wondered if I would be able to use the brush. After 5 or 6 times I adjusted to the sound &amp; vibration and use it daily for over 2 mins. My teeth feel so much cleaner now.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tooth brush I have ever used.  Not sure I would pay for all the bells and whistles next time.  I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between the different settings.  I would recommend just going with the basic model.  This thing flat out cleans your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I was sold on the extra features and settings that this one provides but in retrospect, I don&#x27;t think I needed it because I don&#x27;t use the other settings ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for about 7 months and I can&#x27;t clean my teeth any other way. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in time expected, and was what was expected.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. (This one was a replacement.) I can&#x27;t imagine being without one. They seem to last about two years, so be prepared do the recurring cost.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I&#x27;m somewhat new to electric toothbrushes (it&#x27;s been over a decade) The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five it because it&#x27;s only been a week. But I&#x27;ll tell you what, it makes the 2 minute dentist recommendation go by real quick. I found myself doing 4 minutes.</li>
    <li> the best toothbrush ever!!!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had issues brushing too aggressively with a normal toothbrush, and this has a guard to prevent that.  Teeth feel way Cleaner compared to a normal brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries also last a long time without charging so I can travel with this easily</li>
    <li> Perfect. Relatively quiet for an automatic and compared to regular toothbrushes this is far superior. A must buy.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is the exact Sonicare product I have, as I purchased mine here in Beijing.  However, they seem to be close in features, appearance and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using inexpensive off-the-rack electric toothbrushes off and on for several years, I thought I would plunk down some serious change for this beast.  And it is a beast.  When I first used it and ever so gently touched my teeth, I thought my teeth would shatter, my face crack and the top of my head explode.  I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t hurt myself as the toothbrush went one way and I went another. I am sure that seismometers all across the globe registered the vibrations that occurred at that split second.  Images of jackhammers flooded my brain. My immediate thought was, &amp;#34;I can never use this thing!&amp;#34;  Back to the serious change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had spent so much on it, I gave it a second try.  And then a third.  Finally, over time, we reached a working form of detente.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about a year later, I can confidently say that it remains a beast, but a kindly one at that.  I have grown used to the construction-zone vibration and seismic activity that occurs in my mouth when I use it.  And, to be sure, it gets the job done.  It is, in fact, one of the best long-term purchases I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and purchase one. I highly recommend it. However, when you first use it, be sure there are no sharp protruding objects nearby.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare Flexcare Plus.  This one does not seem to clean as well as the others.  The head does not vibrate as much, therefore my teeth do not feel as clean.  Considering returning</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an identical model that we had for years and finally gave out on us. This one works just the way I was expecting, came packaged nicely and in good condition. If you are seeking a nice Sonicare with some options then I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this electric toothbrush.  I enjoy using it and she gives me 5 star reviews, so I&#x27;ll give this the same.</li>
    <li> I have no other experience with an electric toothbrush, so I can;t compare brands, but I love this one for the price and comfort of use.  My periodontist recommended it because I was not keeping up with my &amp;#34;rubber tipping&amp;#34; which is supposed to help tighten gum tissue.  I avoided electrifying my toothbrushing experience for years.  But as soon as I tried this, I find it easier to reach hard-to-reach areas, I love the gum massage feature, and my perio hygienist says she can see improvement.  I also love how clean my teeth feel compared to a manual brush. Just be sure to follow your dentist&#x27;s instructions on how to brush, as there are various videos on the internet which my professional says are NOT the correct way to brush my sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> YOUR TEETH WILL FEEL LIKE YOU JUST LEFT THE DENTIST OFFICE FROM A PROFESSIONAL CLEANING.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, has a nice massage feature, easy to keep clean and comes with a nice travel case.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is the best toothbrush out there. I just upgraded to this one after my last sonicare finally gave up after 10 years of use. Seriously, it lasted for 10 years. I expect the same from this one. The extra features on this aren&#x27;t really necessary though. I only use the main cleaning setting.</li>
    <li> Engineers look at functionality in a simplistic mechanical way.&lt;br /&gt;Designers look for artful symmetry in design.&lt;br /&gt;Both failed to collaborate to design a functional piece that takes into account human anatomy as well as basic physics. To place on/off/change buttons at the singular location, the fulcrum of our toothbrush lever, which is where the human hand needs to balance the forces of pushing against the teeth while still holding, shows a lack of creative collaborative thought.&lt;br /&gt;Offsetting them slightly to either side would solve the problem of accidentally hitting those buttons. Having a programmable disable feature once brushing begins is another solution. Having buttons slightly recessed with a thin slide to cover is another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting that manufacturer testing &amp; research of how quickly the non-replaceable enamel is worn down by our now more abrasive head speeds that information is not being shared and makes me wonder what teeth will look like after years of use. Especially when combined with the more abrasive \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes that have been out these past few years.</li>
    <li> Have used a sonic elite for years getting compliments from my dentist on the healthy condition of my gums and teeth.  So when it stopped charging I decided to upgrade rather than order a new charging stand.  Package arrived today, Thanks Amazon, fast delivery.  But have to say, for the upgraded price couldn&#x27;t Sonic include at least 2 brush heads?  I received 3 when I ordered my first one.  Have things gotten that tight?  Truthfully, I think I will return and simply buy a replacement charger for $14 since I still have several replacement brush heads for my older machine.  They make a quality product and it does the job (especially since our teeth aren&#x27;t suppose to last into our 70&#x27;s) but geeeez you couldn&#x27;t include an spare brush head?</li>
    <li> After using Oral-B for years, I decided to give Sonicare a try since both brands of brush heads now cost just as outrageously high... After using this brush for about a week, I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth feel MUCH cleaner. When I floss afterwards, hardly any \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; comes out, unlike while I was using the Oral-B. The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibrating mechanism feels much stronger and the pointyness of the brush head feels like it&#x27;s really getting in there.</li>
    <li> This does what it needs to do, but I will be honest, my husband and I think it can be a little strong, using the gum sensitive setting till your teeth are used to the pressure would be best.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good price and works great</li>
    <li> great price, great quality,  arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years, but this new model is the BEST ever.  My dentist suggested it and he saw a marked improvement after only two weeks.  I love it and the new charger doesn&#x27;t have a place for goop to collect.  Also, changing heads is much easier and cleaner that the old model. A little expensive, but worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great. It has helped my receeding gums and my teeth are much cleaner than with the old handheld brush.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush which I purchased on dentist recommendation. Still not used to it but my teeth certainly feel cleaner. Best price I have seen.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I&#x27;ve been getting great dental check ups since I started using Sonicare.  I have used Sonicare since 2005!</li>
    <li> A one Item and seller</li>
    <li> MY periodontal hygienist has insisted on electric toothbrush and recommended Phillips. The product is fine.  I  find the vibration irritating but will use it.</li>
    <li> My teeth are way cleaner than before Sonicare.  This brand and model were recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> Sept 13th 2014  and I have had no problems with it.  I have only had to charge it twice since I bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s taken me this long to get a Sonicare toothbrush but I can honestly say I&#x27;m am very satisfied with my purchase. Brushing with a Sonicare compared to traditional brushing (even with those disposable, battery operated ones from the grocery store) is like comparing night to day. Spend the extra few bucks and get this toothbrush. Your mouth will thank you every morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: keep your manual toothbrush if you have one. If you are a tongue brusher like me, I use the manual for the tongue and keep the Sonicare head strictly for cleaning my teeth and gums. Extends the life of the head just a bit more.</li>
    <li> Until robots can wash my teeth for me, this product will have to do, and it does seem to do it well. I recommend and so does my dentist.</li>
    <li> This really cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> Can anyone really live without these? I had my old one for 5 and half years with no issues. It just stopped working and the lights were flashing orange. I went and got one of those $5 vibrating ones from Target and was horrified by the difference! After using it for two days my entire jaw was sore. I ordered this with Amazon Prime the next day and I&#x27;m back in heaven. Never again will I try the cheap ones. It&#x27;s amazing! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I like the 5 different options of brushing on this Sonicare. Specially the gum care. Also has a sensitive setting. I have periodontal disease since the birth of my daughter. My dentist recommended this brush for a nice clean that I can&#x27;t get with a manual brush. A few weeks after I started using this, my dentist really noticed my teeth were really clean, then I told her I bought the tooth brush she recommended. This is my first electronic tooth brush but I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My teeth are cleaner than ever before.</li>
    <li> I had one of this quality, dropped it and ordered another Philips Essence toothbrush for less price with great reviews. I was just not satisfied until I purchased this one again.  The Flexcare Plus is a really good brush. Now I feel as though I just came from a dental cleaning. I am so satisfied with this brush, Also try purchasing the 2 brush pack for Diamond toothbrush which I could not afford. The brushes for the Diamond will fit the Flexcare Plus. Check the label first.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush along with my water irrigator (flosser) make a great team.  My teeth and gums never felt better. When I go to the dentist,  they always say I make their job really easy. Ever since I&#x27;ve owned one of these toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had no problems with my teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  I use Sonicare toothbrush for years, upgrading them to higher and higher model.  This one is the best thus far.&lt;br /&gt;Gum massage option is a nice addition to the previous model I had.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I have bought. My other one wore out after five years.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> A very effective device. Technologically sound and the version I would most recommend. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and has all the features you might want. And my dentist has noticed quite a change for the better in my teeth since I&#x27;ve begun using it. Even had a small cavity reverse itself as a result of using the Sonicare. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great when it works.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd right now.  They just stop working.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used !</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast! I love this toothbrush. A few new features that I like better than my old version of this same toothbrush. Each choice for brushing has a light so you can tell what you&#x27;re doing. Easy to select a different choice, even while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
    <li> Works great. Unfortunately I am on my second one. First one refused to charge after a few months. Company replaced it with no charge and is working fine. Still gets 5 stars since company was responsive and corrected the problem.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush will change your life. I hate brushing my teeth with other Busch league toothbrushes. It is truly euphoric!!!!</li>
    <li> I had Sonic E series that needed replacing.  I did not want to wait for new one so I started shopping locally for replacement.  Could not find a Sonic at a price I was willing to pay so I chose another brand that was on sale w/o all the bells and whistles.  Got that one home charged it (took a very long time) and immediately knew I wasted time and money.  That tooth brush was harsh on my gun and I had a hand massage after each use which is not something I needed twice per day.  My gums were sore after couple uses I knew I would not keep it.  Sore gums do not bode well for denture wearers.  Within a couple of days I saw this one on Amazon and the reviews were good.  It cost much more than what I returned.  When I saw the coupon for additional savings on top of the offering of additional 10% off Sonic products I started shopping and decided to try this one.  Oh my how happy my mouth is.  Gums not sore, teeth feel dentist clean.  It has several options all of which I have tried and absolutely love.  I use the clean setting first, when I am finished I use the gum option then sometimes (time permitting) I use the massaging option.  It has limited hand vibrations.  This sounds like a lot of brushing but it makes my mouth feel wonderful and I want to use the toothbrush for all its features after all that is why I bought it otherwise get the less expensive one.  I look forward to years of using this toothbrush and hopefully my dental check ups will get better and better.  Did I mention it is an attractive toothbrush worth display....Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to receive my Philips Sonicare so quickly from Amazon!  The product is very good and effective, and I like it very much!</li>
    <li> A great electric toothbrush, the sonicare is amazing.  I originally purchased this model over the others because of the more narrow handle on it, but I much prefer it over the lower-end model my girlfriend has.  It has a clean, professional, and adult look to it and fits the hand like a solid toothbrush should instead of like a Dremel tool with a toothbrush attachment like the lower-end models do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t very clear from the product description when I first ordered it, but one of the buttons on this device is a mechanical button (the power button) and the other is a capacitive touch button (the mode button).  The capacitive touch button is extremely well designed, requiring a very deliberate touch while the brush is off in order to change the mode.  There are a handful of modes the brush can run in, with a couple giving a pulse pattern instead of a constant run.  Largely the difference is the amount of time the brush will run, but if the &amp;#34;quadra-pacer&amp;#34; setting is used, the mode being used changes when the pacing is signaled.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to these modes, there are two settings that apply to every mode that aren&#x27;t selected the same way.  The first is a &amp;#34;quadra-pacer&amp;#34;, and the second is a beginner mode.  The &amp;#34;quadra-pacer&amp;#34; is a feature that when turned on will cause the brush to pause briefly in it&#x27;s normal routine to notify you that 1/4 of the cycle is done when, and how frequently this actually occurs depends on the mode selected however.  The beginner mode is intended for those unused to electric tooth brushes and supposedly starts with a weaker sonic brushing, ramping up over time as the brush is used again and again.  Beginner mode can be reset to start over again, or it can be turned off completely (like I did), but is enabled by default when the brush is received.&lt;br /&gt;Of the modes, the most basic is the standard brushing one.  It runs for 2 minutes before automatically shutting off, and if the quadrapacer is enabled it will pause very briefly every 30 seconds. Another mode is a gum massage mode that slightly changes the pulse frequency the brush runs at, and sets the time for 1 minute.  In this mode the quadrapacer notifies you every 15 seconds.  The mode I use for my regular brushing is one that combines both of these.  The brush runs each of the two modes back-to-back without pause, for a total of 3 minutes of running time, and if the quadrapacer is on it will actually provide 8 notifications, the first 4 in 30 second intervals, then the last 4 in 15 second intervals.  Additionally because its running the different modes back-to-back, the pulse frequency of the brush changes slightly for the last 1 minute.  This isn&#x27;t really a significant change though and is barely detectable even when waiting for it.  There are also a couple other modes, including a refresh mode that runs for 1 minute with the normal brushing pulse frequency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;The battery is a sealed internal rechargeable battery that recharges wirelessly from an included base unit.  The actual base unit is only a little bigger than the base of the brush, and about 1/2&amp;#34; thick.  It has a small stud that fits loosely with the bottom of the brush to orient it.  Included is also a larger plastic case that the charging unit fits into that provides a larger and more stable base, small mounting studs for 2 extra brush heads, and hooks/space for wrapping the cord to keep it out of the way.  The really major selling point of this though, isn&#x27;t how easy it is to charge (which is incredibly simple and fast), but the fact that it almost never needs to be charged.  The usage time listed is 2 weeks between charges, but using it in the longest (3 minute) mode usually once a day, but occasionally twice a day, I easily make it closer to 3 weeks between charges.  This makes it an absolutely perfect travel companion since you just need to make sure it&#x27;s charged before you pack it and then don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing the charger.  At the bottom of the brush is a set of 3 battery lights that clearly indicate the battery level whenever the brush is used and for a few minutes after.  Putting it on the charging base will cause all the battery lights to fade on and off while it&#x27;s charging until they all stay solid on when it&#x27;s fully charged.  When the charge is low, it will pulse only the lowest battery light whenever it would show the battery level, and when it&#x27;s critically low the light color changes to orange instead of yellowish-green and the brush will occasionally pulse strangely while being used (clearly an indication to the user to check the battery level and charge it).  Charging it seems to only take 30 minutes to an hour from a nearly empty charge, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage &amp; Additional Parts&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Knowing this was clearly going to be used in a wet environment, the entire brush is sealed and waterproof.  I use mine in the shower, so I keep it laying sideways on a shower rack when I&#x27;m not using or charging it, pick it up to use it while I&#x27;m showering, rinse it in the shower when I&#x27;m done, then put it back on the rack (laying on its side).  The only gap in the entire unit is where the replaceable brush head attaches, there being a small gap between the bottom of the brush head and the top of the motor unit when it&#x27;s fully seated.  This isn&#x27;t particularly noticeable since it&#x27;s right below the colored band on the brush heads, but it does mean that the top of the unit needs to be slightly cleaned of build up whenever the brush head is replaced (just to keep it clean, not because functionality is in any way affected).  In the package for this brush, you receive one brush head, the hand unit, a charging base that plugs into the wall, a plastic cover for the charging base (described above), and a travel case that fits the hand unit (without an attached brush head) and up to two brush heads.  The travel case has been unbelievably nice in my experience, making it very easy to take the whole thing with me in my luggage without having to worry about getting dirt on my brush heads or somehow destroying the short metal drive shaft that extends from the hand unit into the brush heads when they&#x27;re attached.  The ability to carry two brush heads seems like overkill to me, but the case clearly isn&#x27;t extended or the design modified so two could be handled instead of just one so it&#x27;s hard for me to fault the design.  Brush heads are rather standard, you don&#x27;t need to buy OEM despite what some reviewers have said, you just need to find brush heads that specifically fit this model of unit, and they generally last 2-3 months before they need replacing.</li>
    <li> Paid for the newest model the HX6921, but received an older version HX6950. Love sonicare toothbrushes. Snooker is the only reason I still have my teeth at age 61</li>
    <li> Huge fan of the Sonicare Flexcare series. Enjoying the different time and vibration/cleaning options. A few years back, my boyfriend tried mine and loved it so much that he ordered himself one immediately. The only problem with the fabulous feeling Sonicare gives your mouth is that a manual toothbrushing will never compare again.</li>
    <li> I also bought one for my son and grandson. I think that says it all.</li>
    <li> Good product but a bit pricey. I owned 3 of these longevity is an issue. When the internal battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore it&#x27;s off to the trash can. If I didn&#x27;t stock up on brush heads I would have tried the Oral B.</li>
    <li> Former oral b user... It&#x27;s different but it felt great... Really cleans.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush for the money. The options available are tremendous.</li>
    <li> This replaces my old E-Series handle which is going on 10 years old now.  This Flexcare is awesome in comparison to the old handle (and that&#x27;s saying something since I&#x27;ve loved my Sonicare since I got it).  I was impressed with the different settings, not only for cleaning, but gum care down to massaging.  I&#x27;m not sure I need all those things, but the massage does feel good.  The other great side effect is that the brush heads are much cheaper than the old E-Series heads (4@$17 vs. 3@$35).  The design is great, very easy to hold, and I find myself not applying as much pressure as I did with the heavier E.  Much easier to travel with (lighter, slimmer, and the charger is smaller).  And best of all, my teeth feel even cleaner now.  All in all, a great replacement or a terrific first time purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the third Flexcare Plus I bought after using 2 in 10 years.  So their longevity is long.  The brushing process is just about the same as the previous ones however with this brush if I want to go to a different setting I have to turn it off and then press the button for the desired setting.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift. I&#x27;ve used this model and can attest to how great it is. But, beware the expensive replacement heads. I suggest Target&#x27;s brand or another generic. They&#x27;re harder to put on the wand, but are half the price.</li>
    <li> Weird at first, but now I look forward to using it because I know it is helping me and my mouth, teeth and gums feel great!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist, and I really like it.  Never really used an electric toothbrush before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to.  With that in mind, I have been very happy so far.  It seems to do a really good job of cleaning and has a lot of different settings that I haven&#x27;t even used yet.  Comes with a travel case too, nice features.</li>
    <li> Effective.  Better than earlier versions.</li>
    <li> Just after 2 years warranty, bottom of the back of the unit start peeling coating of silicon I think Sonicare wants you to buy new toothbrush every 2 years? Too expensive , I think</li>
