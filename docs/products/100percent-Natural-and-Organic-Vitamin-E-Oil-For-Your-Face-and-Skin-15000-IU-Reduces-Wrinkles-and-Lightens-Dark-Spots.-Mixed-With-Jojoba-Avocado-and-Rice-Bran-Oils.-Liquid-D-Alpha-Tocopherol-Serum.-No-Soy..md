      <li>It&#x27;s important that it is non-synthetic because there are lots of Vitamin E&#x27;s out there that are synthetic.</li>

      <li>When the 1/2 oz bottle arrived I was excited to have been asked to test it out and give my honest opinion because I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time in the sun this summer and my skin was starting to show it.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to others works on fine lines.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is unusual.</li>
      <li>It is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first because I was brought up not to put oil directly on my face or it could break out.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality cosmetic-grade Vitamin E Oil</li>
      <li>Received this item to review it and would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting the cheap stuff, but they put real vitamin E in this along with other oils.</li>
      <li>This luxurious oil goes on smooth with minimal residue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice a day after cleansing my face and started to see results in just a few days with more supple skin.</li>
      <li>I gave this vitamin E oil to my wife so that she could try something new in hopes of lightening her stretch marks.</li>
      <li>It is also great for the scars that are left behind from the acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to skip it a few mornings when I had meetings with clients because it is quite strong.</li>
      <li>Soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>Using it for only a week and my skin already feels much smoother.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
      <li>I feel fresh after applied on my face and neck, also can stay longer than other serum.</li>
      <li>ITS BEEN ALONG TIME SINCE HER SKIN HAS BEEN SO SOFT AND NOT DRY .</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin super shiny or oily.  </li>

    <li> Very awesome product,highly recommended</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift, and she already wants more</li>
    <li> i got a deal on them to give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;i like this item.make skin more smooth and shine.&lt;br /&gt;will recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I found this oil to be a little heavy to use by itself on my face so I mix it with a light serum before applying.  But I love what it does to my hands.  It gives them a super softness that lasts.  The fragrance is unusual. It is strong and doesn&#x27;t smell very good if you smell it from the bottle, but it has a light oily citrus smell when you rub it in.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! Improves overall texture and quality of my skin. Love that is natural and organic!It is light and not greasy! Def recommend this serum!</li>
    <li> It is nice and has a soft smell.Easy to put on.I been using it under my eyes to help keep the skin hydrated.I also put some in my bath water while I soak to help moisturize the rest of my skin. It is very relaxing. Apply Vitamin E oil on any kind of scar, like pigemntation scars, keloid scars, scars made by cuts, scrapes, wounds, surgeries etc. It can also be used for acne scars, but it could  break you out. But it is great to have at home. I RECEIVED THIS  PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Received this item to review it and would highly recommend it.  Using it for only a week and my skin already feels much smoother.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Soft and silky.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for your skin and I love it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I was expecting the cheap stuff, but they put real vitamin E in this along with other oils. The only flaw is the smell. It is a bit strong, but it&#x27;s still pleasant. My skin is oily so I can&#x27;t use this but it is perfect for my wife&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> This luxurious oil goes on smooth with minimal residue. Soaks into the skin nicely. No smell. I used it on some of my scars on my face from an accident. I could see vast improvement by the time the bottle was done. It&#x27;s a great bang for your buck. I also used this as a shaving gel base and it also worked wonders. After I put this on my face scars I would run the rest through my hair. That also looked amazing and not greasy. I would recommend this product as a great buy with luxurious look and feel.</li>
    <li> This complimentary bottle received to review is great. This is really is a great solution for my the sporadic acne that I get on my face no matter what I try (and I have tried so many oils and creams). It is also great for the scars that are left behind from the acne. It&#x27;s important that it is non-synthetic because there are lots of Vitamin E&#x27;s out there that are synthetic. I feel confident about the ingredients and I don&#x27;t mind the lavender smell. I read about others using it on scars so I&#x27;m going to give it a try on my surgery scars and also adding it to my hair conditioning routine. So many ways to benefit from this vitamin E.</li>
    <li> I gave this vitamin E oil to my wife so that she could try something new in hopes of lightening her stretch marks. As she started putting on the Vitamin E oil about 3 weeks ago, we can already tell a difference. Before she started, her stretch marks were purple/pink in color and now they have faded into the color of her surrounding skin. We also noticed that the oil helped tighten the extra skin that was stretched out from having the baby. The oil has little to no smell and feels great to the touch. I would recommend this oil to any mommy looking for a stretch mark treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE* I received this product at a discount or for no cost in exchange for my honest review. If you found this review helpful, please let Amazon (and myself!) know by clicking &#x27;yes&#x27; underneath this review. (ô&amp;iquest;ô)</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It came very quickly and it is wonderful. I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel. I use it day and night. I received a discount to review this product.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to others works on fine lines.</li>
    <li> For my observation cause i let my wife test it, well she said she love the smell of it like its not that strong , then if you will try it the product has 100% natural &amp; organic Vitamin E oil for your face &amp; skin - 15000 IU and it reduces wrinkles &amp; lightens dark spots. Infused With Jojoba &amp; Avocado Oils.This is for repairing damaged skin and reduce the effects of aging, it reduces fine lines too and wrinkles and improves skin tone and texture.</li>
    <li> WHEN I ORDER THIS PRODUCT I ORDERED IT TO SEE IF IT WOULD HELP THE FINE LINES AROUND MY EYES . WHEN IT CAME IN THE MAIL MY MOTHER WAS AT MY HOUSE AND OPENED IT. SHE SAW IT WAS VITAMIN E AND DECIDED TO TRY IT ON HER ARMS. MY MOTHER HAS HAD SKIN CANCER AND HAS VERY DRY ARMS . SHE  PUT A DROPPER FULL ON HER ARMS AND RUBBED IT IN. SHE LOVED THE WAY HER SKIN FELT AFTERWARDS . ITS BEEN ALONG TIME SINCE HER SKIN HAS BEEN SO SOFT AND NOT DRY . I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for doing this review. The instructions say to put 5 drops on your face and neck morning and night. I do not like the smell of this product and it left my face feeling greasy. I appreciate the fact that it is all natural, but the smell and feel are too bad for me to overcome. I will probably be giving this product away.</li>
    <li> I feel fresh after applied on my face and neck, also can stay longer than other serum. Very good product. A++</li>
    <li> When the 1/2 oz bottle arrived I was excited to have been asked to test it out and give my honest opinion because I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time in the sun this summer and my skin was starting to show it. I&#x27;ve used this twice a day after cleansing my face and started to see results in just a few days with more supple skin. It definitely showed it was being hydrated. That&#x27;s a good thing. I was hesitant at first because I was brought up not to put oil directly on my face or it could break out. This is a high quality cosmetic-grade Vitamin E Oil so it does its job doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but my husband and daughter aren&#x27;t fond of it. I&#x27;ve had to skip it a few mornings when I had meetings with clients because it is quite strong. But, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for beauty!</li>
    <li> i really love this stuff. i used it n made my skin so soft when normally my skin is really dry. this is a great product to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin super shiny or oily.  It moisturizes without the slip and slide feel or sweaty shine.</li>
