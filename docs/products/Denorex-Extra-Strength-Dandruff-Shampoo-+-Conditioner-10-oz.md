    <li> I love this product! the tingling took my off guard but makes me feel like my scalp is getting clean. I was worried about what would happen if it got in my eye but there was nothing to worry about. there will just be a tingling feeling that won&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Please do not stop selling this product!! It is literally the only thing that works for me and the stores have stopped selling it for some stupid reason. This stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> What I was looking for right to my door step</li>
    <li> good price and good shipping</li>
    <li> Great for people with stress related flakes and dermatitis.</li>
    <li> Works well for itchy scalp. Use on all ages monthly for a good cleanse.</li>
    <li> Nothing against the seller, or the brand, just the main active ingredient: It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Coal Tar Solution is the only one that actually stops the itch AND prevents it from coming back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Coal Tar Solution since 1995, and once, when the store was out of the Coal Tar solution, I opted for this, simply as a compromise.....it did nothing. Spent the rest of the week in agony O.o</li>
    <li> recv&#x27;d on time, works as expected</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with it, it keeps my scalp clean.</li>
    <li> Everything&#x27;s fine, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This is a great Shampoo for Psoarsis sufferers! highly recommend! It&#x27;s a great product, inexpensive and it actually works! I love the tingle it gives on the scalp whn applying it helps me feel where I actually applied the shampoo. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dandruff shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used it for close to 40 years, everyday.</li>
    <li> This is the only Shampoo that works on my Dandruff.</li>
    <li> Hubby had an issue with his scalp and this help within days. Seriously worked on the infection and smell</li>
    <li> The only thing that really eliminated my teenage son&#x27;s problem.  Worth the extra money than other brands.  Also don&#x27;t need to use a lot each time do a bottle lasts a good while</li>
    <li> Just what we expected. On time, good price.</li>
