      <li>Just as good as the expensive brands, easy to use, and smells great!</li>

      <li>conditioner is great if you also have hair that tends to go flat like mine does.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely - not too overpowering but still strong enough to give a nice experience when showering.</li>
      <li>This Suave Professionals is a straightforward conditioner that needs no gimmicks to get the job done.</li>

      <li>I have used Suave products for years and in general am very satisfied with their products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is true.  </li>
      <li>I found that it didn&#x27;t offer me much in the way of detangling assistance, which meant more breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s kind of a masculine scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It conditions the hair really nice!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this line! Leaves my hair feeling fresh, clean and healthy!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a devotee of Pureology for over 10 years, and I think I like this just as well! In fact, I think it does a better job of preventing breakage.</li>
    <li> Quality product does the job well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the mid-range line of Suave products with their improved conditioning ability at a reasonable price. The line that is in these gold containers is generally a good one (the Moroccan oil infused one is the best in my experience, but others are also quite good). This one seemed to fall a bit shorter on the merits than some of the others that I&#x27;ve tried and I have no idea why that should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary point that I had issues with was the amount of frizz it controled and the lack of shine enhanceent. It did a great job of boosting body and maintaining wave. Combing my hair out, which can be a chore without conditioning because it is very long and think, was not problem either. The texture of my hair was also nice and soft. The scent was a bit too perfumey for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and perhaps this one just didn&#x27;t play as nice with mine as some of the others have. I would choose this over other conditioners, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose it over other conditioners at the same price point in the same line made by Suave.</li>
    <li> I paired this with the matching shampoo. The results were fabulous! The conditioner is thin enough that is easily distributes throughout one&#x27;s hair. And, it rinses super clean (with such a great scent!). My hair was left light, bouncy, shiny, and gorgeously smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, I love the design of the upside-down bottle ... it makes getting those drops of the conditioner a breeze to get. (No more adding water, shaking, and then using diluted conditioner ... you know what I mean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Suave has produced an effective, inexpensive product that everyone can enjoy. Bravo, Suave!</li>
    <li> This has a really nice smell and works well for my somewhat curly/frizzy hair. The scent is lovely - not too overpowering but still strong enough to give a nice experience when showering. I really like the Suave lines and will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length hair, and conditioner is an important part of my haircare regime.  Since breakage is a huge problem when your hair constantly gets caught and snagged, I was immediately drawn to this anti-breakage conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a bit thicker than other Suave conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, and has a light floral scent with a hint of ginger spiciness.  The scent lingers a little after the conditioner has been washed out, giving the hair a pleasant, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this conditioner, my hair was in rather sad shape thanks to another Suave product that did absolutely nothing to hydrate and protect the hair follicles.  I did see an immediate improvement to my hair within a few days, which I honestly hadn&#x27;t expected - I had believed that these Suave conditioners were all more or less the same, with the only difference being the fragrance assigned to the bottle.  Not true!  After two weeks, my hair felt much glossier and stronger - at least, I was noticing fewer strands of hair breaking off when I combed or brushed my mane.</li>
    <li> I have used Suave products for years and in general am very satisfied with their products. This conditioner has a nice fragrance. The fragrance is pleasant and not to strong. This conditioner did a good job of conditioning my hair. My hair felt nice and soft. Overall, this is a good conditioner at a good price.</li>
    <li> I really never thought I would say this about a Suave product, but this conditioner actually works really well. I don&#x27;t need a ton of it too work, either. It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the scent stay on your hair after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair highlighted, and the pieces that were bleached for the highlights were really dry and rough feeling. As soon as I used this conditioner, I could tell the difference - my hair felt better. The dry, rough highlighted sections started to feel much better and the texture was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on the hair or weigh it down. It rinses easily and leaves your hair hydrated, soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair smelling so fresh and clean.  It has a nice scent that is a pleasure to use in the shower.  It&#x27;s not fruity or sweet smelling, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe for color treated hair and was formulated to help with hair breakage.  I am hoping that with continued use, my hair will be stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, my hair feels very soft but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It still has a lot of bounce.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner for when you&#x27;re looking for regular conditioning to make hair smooth without weighing it down. It&#x27;s not overly thick, so even those with fine or thin hair can use this without it leaving hair limp. After using this I&#x27;m able to curl my hair easily and the curls stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light floral scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I&#x27;m not a fan of products that have strong in-your-face flowery scents. This isn&#x27;t one of those. It&#x27;s light and sweet and has a great summertime smell to it. It washes out cleanly and leaves my hair smooth and fluffy.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner that I have used for the last few years has recently changed their formula and it no longer provides the moisture that I need.  I have now begun shopping for a new favorite product.  While I enjoy this one because it has a nice scent, it does not provide the amount of moisture that I need.  I have tried almost this entire line because it is comparable to pureology within their description.  I don&#x27;t know if that is true.  While pureology is too expensive for me to buy on a regular basis, it does have a tendency to give my fair, limp hair bounce.  This does not.  It is a little too thin and doesn&#x27;t give me the moisture and volume that I would prefer.  On the plus side, it does not dry my hair out either.  This would be perfect for someone with normal hair that wants a daily conditioner.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the bottle, the scent was pleasant with the aroma of spicy ginger and sweet honeysuckle. The texture is somewhat thinner than other conditioners I have used, but it is Suave. When I used it, it was okay. It definitely conditioned my hair, but I felt like it left a film and the next day, my hair was slightly greasy. I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair everyday and use dry shampoo in between washes because otherwise I get split ends, but with this conditioner, I would have to wash everyday. I have very soft, but thick hair (it&#x27;s not coarse, but is thick).</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about all of the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Shampoos and Conditioners now, and I really enjoy what they do for my hair. They are a step above the standard Suave products in the clear plastic bottles. They are a little thicker and seem to be a little more effective. This particular conditioner is thick and creamy out of the bottle and spreads well throughout my hair. It hels to keep my locks tangle-free and it has a nice floral scent that&#x27;s not remotely overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I have medium-length hair that isn&#x27;t too thick.  I still deal with tangling at times so I look for conditioners that help with that.  This conditioner still found me tugging at my hair after getting out of the shower.  I prefer not having to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light floral scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s nice and clean and I liked it a lot.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t stay most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came taped up which is a HUGE plus as I&#x27;ve had Amazon items like this come to me, sans tape, in a huge mess!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive brands, easy to use, and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this product (and I have used other Suave products in the past).  The conditioner has a good amount of thickness, the scent is REALLY nice smelling, and it seems to condition my hair well.  It&#x27;s nice to get good hair care without busting your budget!</li>
    <li> I love the smell! My hair is soft without being weighed down. I&#x27;m having more luck with this conditioner than brands where I&#x27;ve spent 3x as much...</li>
    <li> Too soft and didn&#x27;t feel washed as a base shampoo, and my hair is on the fine to normal side. The conditioner the same, had to use globs of it to detangle half my hair. Once detangled it had no volume to it.  The smell is nice though and Suave is a good affordable name brand. I think they have other ones I tried that worked better then this. Then again, every ones hair is different and the texture, so it has to be taken into consideration.</li>
    <li> Wow, this conditioner smells really good!  It has a warm, spicy scent, that is just delightful.  I wish it lasted longer on my hair.  It does a fine job of conditioning.  This conditioner is meant specifically for anti-breakage.  I don&#x27;t have huge hair breakage problems, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that, but it did do a good job of conditioning, which is the main thing I want from my conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love Suave products and buy them all the time for our household. And happily I&#x27;ve gotten to try out numerous Suave Shampoos and Conditioners -- experimenting on my family and myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Awapuhi Ginger &amp; Huneysuckle is a lighter conditioner than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s perfect for my daughter&#x27;s shorter hair, but for my now long hair I prefer more conditioning and detangling help.  The sort I&#x27;ve found with [[ASIN:B00GTC0346 Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Seaweed and Lotus Blossom Conditioner]] or Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00AVWJUA8 Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has a light fragrance and is the typical white color. I found that it didn&#x27;t offer me much in the way of detangling assistance, which meant more breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you only want light conditioning without a lot of lingering scent, this would probably be a nice choice.</li>
    <li> All I use is suave products on my hair because they are affordable and do the same if not better job as their expensive salon brand competitors. This particular product is my favorite. The scent is very fresh and natural smelling, and the way it leaves my hair is amazing. I am African American and have used suave products to transition my hair from relaxed to natural. I am now 100% natural (though I do flat iron weekly and never do wash and gos)and this product has helped me retain length. My hair is past my bra straps and is healthy because of this product! It easily helps de tangle my hair and leaves minimal hair shed in my brush/comb/hand. I use it once weekly and it has given my hair so much moisture life and less breakage. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Honeysuckle is probably my favorite flower scent and it combines well with the ginger in this new Suave line of hair products.  And the conditioner will smooth and detangle hair though  for me it leaves my hair feeling a little heavier than I like.  Of late I have found I prefer the many new leave in products to improve hair quality to these more old style conditioner that are rinsed out.  Like all Suave products the price is right but you get what you pay for as better if slightly more expensive products are available.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product.  The fragrance is light and wonderful and it really softens my hair making it silky soft and feeling great.  My hair seems to have more bounce and volume also.  My only problem with this was my eyes got itchy and puffy afterwards which could mean a mild allergy to it but I will try it again once my cold is gone to see if mayhap it was that which caused the problems and not the conditioner.</li>
    <li> A miracle for your hair and better than the expensive stuff,</li>
    <li> I love the thickness of this conditioner. It leaves my hair nice and smooth and shiny, something that surprised me. I have thick long wavy hair and in the past Suave hair products have not been a good match for me. The scent is wonderful too, just a hint of honeysuckle. I am quite impressed with this line, I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I like the ginger and honeysuckle scent of this conditioner, although I don&#x27;t really pick up on the honeysuckle. I do notice the ginger and it&#x27;s not overpowering. It&#x27;s not my favorite scent from the Natural Infusions line, but it is nice. It seems to rinse out well, but it does weigh my hair down a little. I have found that I can&#x27;t use it often because of this, so I use it occasionally. I don&#x27;t know why this conditioner has that effect when others from this line seem more weightless on my hair.  I&#x27;ll use it, but I won&#x27;t replace it when it&#x27;s gone. However, I will buy other varieties from this line.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully on my hair.</li>
    <li> great stuff for his money</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which becomes very tangled after shampooing. I would never think of going without conditioner unless I want to spend a lot of time trying to comb out tangles before drying it. There are only a few conditioners that work as well as this one and make it very easy to comb through right after toweling my hair. And the nice thing is that it leaves my hair soft without weighing it down. It also eliminates static electricity. Two of my other favorite conditioners are by Suave as well. [[ASIN:B00A0IWRU8 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner 28 oz]] and [[ASIN:B0000530G6 Suave Professionals Conditioner, Humectant - 12.6 Ounce]] . I like that these are reasonably priced and work as well or better than the expensive hair salon brands which I never buy anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the three products in this line for several weeks now. I love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakage is a huge problem for me because I keep my hair very long so I&#x27;ve been making use of the system together and so far I can&#x27;t honestly say I&#x27;m seeing a huge difference in how much breakage there is but my hair texture has significantly improved. It&#x27;s smoother and each strand feels much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is great if you also have hair that tends to go flat like mine does. It&#x27;s nourishing but doesn&#x27;t make my hair so heavy it flattens in an hour post shower. For the price this is a great conditioner if you have long straight hair and I haven&#x27;t noticed any trouble with it affecting my hair coloring either.</li>
    <li> Pretty good conditioner, but I have used other products that leave my hair both smoother but yet less oily than this one. It detangles hair well though and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair a little oily</li>
    <li> This conditioner is inexpensive - and it&#x27;s one of my favorites, serious!  I have a automatic supply coming now as it&#x27;s just a great deal!</li>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair soft, but a little limp. It&#x27;s a fairly heavy conditioner with a light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger after drying (too bad, because it&#x27;s a nice scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on detangling. My hair is long, a little frizzy, and prone to knots, and this helped me comb through it without problems. Worth a try, considering it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is the third set of shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;ve used from this line. (I was provided the conditioner for review, but I bought the shampoo in order to having a &amp;#34;matching&amp;#34; set.) There was one set that was WAY too perfum-y for my tastes, but this one has a pleasant smell that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the shampoo from this set, my hair felt odd, and I ended up shampooing twice, because I thought maybe I&#x27;d used more styling product than normal. I soon learned that it left my hair feeling that way every time. It feels almost dry, like it will break at the slightest touch. I can look at my hair and it looks dry and dull. I&#x27;m greatly unhappy with the way my hair looks and feels while I&#x27;ve used this shampoo/conditioner. I almost never waste anything, but I&#x27;m going to have to throw this set out and buy something else!</li>
    <li> Wish I could order a case of 100. I go through conditioner like crazy.</li>
    <li> For the price I was amazed at how well this worked</li>
    <li> I love Suave and love that I can just order it off Amazon instead of running to the store every time I run out. I like that this conditioner works well with color treated hair and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> Many conditioners advertise their abilities to fix elements of your hair and fail to deliver. This Suave Professionals is a straightforward conditioner that needs no gimmicks to get the job done. The fact that it smells great comes as an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conditioner, it works great. My hair is left feeling amazing in ways achieved typically only by deep conditioners. As someone who takes great care in his selection of conditioners, I can say that this is one that will be in my repertoire for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell works as an added bonus for keeping the conditioner in your hair a little longer to allow it to properly work its magic. Suave has really stepped out its game over the past year. This product follows their pattern of excellence in quality haircare.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner with a shampoo free of sulfates and very mild scent - different brand.  My hair is fine-med and tangles while shampooing.  It is wavy and can get droopy very easy if the conditioner is too heavy.  I like this conditioner because it is not heavy and has a nice scent.  I was concern that the honeysuckle smell would be too strong but it’s subtle and pleasant.  My hair is not super shiny after this conditioner but it is soft and nice.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent conditioner with a nice scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. Since my own preference is for hair products that don&#x27;t interfere or clash with my cologne, that&#x27;s  a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my straight, fine hair soft, and the tips feel conditioned without being weighed down or limp. On my daughter&#x27;s frizz prone, curly hair- it stays fluffy and full of body without frizzing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells delicious and it really makes my damaged, mature hair feel healthier. Works as well as Nexxus for me.</li>
    <li> I loved using this conditioner. It worked to coat every strand with conditioning. My hair felt and looked fuller and more healthy after just one use. I put the conditioner on and left it on for about 5 minutes, rinsed it out and the got out the blow dryer. My hair felt soft, as though I had air dried it. I loved the scent and it gave the product a more expensive feel. You really cannot beat the value of the Suave professionals line.</li>
    <li> Leave for 1-3 minutes. Rinse.  Plus I use with a Light Leave-In Cream.  I have less hair breakage today then I did decades ago before I started using a conditioner after shampooing. Also a conditioner that is only a condition produces less split ends one that is part of a 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner combo. It works fine to soften my thick curly highlighted 50 year old hair, enabling me to run a comb or brush through it for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger isn&#x27;t my favorite scent but after drying and adding a styling product, or 2 or 3 (lol) it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
    <li> I love the Suave Professionals line of conditioner. I have natural hair and this conditioner is very inexpensive and the best for my hair type. It conditions, makes my hair very soft and has excellent slip - good for wash and go&#x27;s. I also leave a little in my hair before styling. My entire family uses this conditioner and I am so glad I found this product line!</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner for the price. I usually order couple a month to share with granddaughter</li>
    <li> works great smells good not a lot of shampoo or conditioner required with this product</li>
    <li> Bad scent and not that great.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, basic conditioner. It has a light scent that leaves my hair smelling nice but not overly strong. My hair is slightly dry, and this conditioner works well. It&#x27;s also a great price and available on Subscribe and Save, so I never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Smells great and leaves hair feeling really soft. Great price too</li>
    <li> it smells weird. it&#x27;s kind of a masculine scent. but it made my hair feel nice.</li>
