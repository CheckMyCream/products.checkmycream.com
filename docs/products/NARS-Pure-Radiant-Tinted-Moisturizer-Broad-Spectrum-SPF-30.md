      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this formula!</li>
      <li>I  love this stuff!</li>
      <li>However, I liked the way it looked on before the reaction.  </li>
      <li>The best thing I can tell about protection and great consistency is sometimes in the mid day</li>
      <li>This is good for evening out the skin and creating a healthy look.</li>
      <li>Nars is really lightweight, has the best coverage ever.</li>
      <li>Laura Mercier TM Nude, Laura Mercier Moisturizng foundation in Warm Ivory, Silk foundation in Medium Ivory, Clinique Even Better foundation in Buff, Stilla Illuminating Foundation</li>
      <li>I was worried at first, but honestly, once I put it on and blended it, it looked great.</li>
      <li>Application is very smooth</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of a strong sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased.</li>
      <li>Theres no reason your daily foundation shouldn&#x27;t look flawless too!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is not greasy, light coverage and stays all day!</li>
      <li>Perhaps it will work better for you.</li>
      <li>I love it&amp;#34;.......</li>
      <li>took one star away because of the price, and when I applied more layers for beter coverage</li>
      <li>For sure this tinted moisturizer makes skin more even.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>It has a yellow undertone, which is perfect for redness.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this because the color of it really matches my skin tone perfectly; it just doesnt lay on my skin right.</li>
      <li>The medium was the perfect color for my blonde hair and light eyes.</li>
      <li>great skin and no make up look, because it doesn&#x27;t mask skin completely</li>
      <li>This has the smoothest, creamiest formula, and spreads so easily.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I use it over bare skin and it looks great.</li>
      <li>No smell and smooth application.</li>
      <li>this is probably one of the darkest shades of light medium that I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
      <li>So that justified the purchase.</li>
      <li>It is light but still has coverage.</li>
      <li>However, the pros (easy application, nice sheer-to-light coverage, decent SPF, doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to flake, 8 hour wear, no parabens) outweigh the yellowish shade issue.</li>
      <li>But this is personal and I am pretty sure most of the ladies would love this product.</li>
      <li>I am fair but with yellow undertones.</li>
      <li>Provides nice, natural coverage.</li>
      <li>30 Watt, Korres Wild Rose WRF1, Tarte Recreate foundation #6 and Tarte TM Agent 10).</li>
      <li>The product has a very light but pleasant floral scent (it disappears minutes later, don&#x27;t worry), it blends remarkably well, and covers minor blemishes better than I had expected.</li>
      <li>I have tried several brands from the cheap drug store kind, to forty dollar products from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and hope that NARS expands this line to include more neutral shades in the medium tone spectrum.</li>
      <li>Good staying power, unless I will touch things with my face (like kissing and playing with my son), it will last the whole day.</li>
      <li>this is worth to try.</li>
      <li>To be honest Nars TM feels totally like Lorac Breakthrough foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives protection, hydration and just the right tint.</li>
      <li>30 is very good additional protection (because itcan be layered or  touch up later on), but without white cast on face (important- regular spf is needed under because make up spf is not considered as primary defense from the sun).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to try tinted moisturizers as I generally need more coverage than they can offer.</li>
      <li>Also very moisturizing, it leaves healthy natural glow without looking oily (like Laura Mercier&#x27;s TM).</li>
      <li>I would recommend trying it in a local shop to be sure you purchase the right shade for your skin.  </li>
      <li>my make up fades, I kiss my toddler son a lot;)</li>
      <li>Love that option, fast, convenient and actually saves money</li>
      <li>The coverage is perfect - more than a tired moisturizer but not as heavy as a foundation.</li>
      <li>really like this product/not my first time purchase.  </li>
      <li>I was not sure what color would be a good match...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been falling in love with NARS products as of late and discovered this amazing little product in a monthly subscription box and was in love.</li>
      <li>It provides smooth , light natural color all day long.</li>
      <li>colors are great for me, as a like yellow base, because it&#x27;s great to cover redness.</li>
      <li>I can use either Finland (winter time) or Alaska (summertime), they match me really well</li>
      <li>the descriptions were very helpful</li>
      <li>It costs almost as much as I spend on my Chanel foundation.</li>
      <li>but it was kind of heavy.</li>
      <li>someone likes decent coverage and almost no feeling of make up</li>
      <li>There is a definite yellow tone to this shade - wish it were a bit more neutral/beige.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use powder over it, not even in my T-zone, but I have a normal skin.</li>
      <li>I apply Nars TM and have refreshed look with protection, very natural.</li>
      <li>I usually use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer in 60 (Neutral to Tan).</li>
      <li>My current skin shade is exactly in between Alaska and St. Moritz.</li>
      <li>Doctors have no trouble finding my veins.</li>
      <li>This summer I have change my make up base for this moisturizer, I ussually use NC25-30 and this matches with my skin tone perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d heard about this tinted moisturizer on several beauty blogs and decided to try it, since I was in the market for a paraben-free and retinyl palmitate-free product with decent SPF coverage.</li>
      <li>but it also gives it this weird powdery look that just isnt very cute.</li>
      <li>Especially when the price is similar to 1oz high end foundations, but the tube is 1.9 oz and you can squeeze last drop, unlike glass containers (I actually cut the tubes in half with any product and there is always decent amount of product left; cover bottom part with the top one and keep it in a ziplock bag to prevent drying or transfer leftover to mini jar from used cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Use as a moisturizer, but I find I can generally skip foundation and barely need concealer with it!</li>

<li> there&#x27;s no more</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product will order again</li>
    <li> I love it&amp;#34;.......</li>
    <li> Big fan of all Nars products, especially the Radiant Moisturizer. It provides smooth , light natural color all day long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard about this tinted moisturizer on several beauty blogs and decided to try it, since I was in the market for a paraben-free and retinyl palmitate-free product with decent SPF coverage. My current skin shade is exactly in between Alaska and St. Moritz. I usually use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer in 60 (Neutral to Tan). I debated which NARS shade to get for a long while then decided to go for St. Moritz since it is now summer and I&#x27;ll probably tan a shade up. Application is very smooth (I do wear moisturizer under this product, though). The product has a very light but pleasant floral scent (it disappears minutes later, don&#x27;t worry), it blends remarkably well, and covers minor blemishes better than I had expected. I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so tan-yellow...this is probably one of the darkest shades of light medium that I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I think I&#x27;ll probably purchase Alaska and blend the two. There is a definite yellow tone to this shade - wish it were a bit more neutral/beige. However, the pros (easy application, nice sheer-to-light coverage, decent SPF, doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to flake, 8 hour wear, no parabens) outweigh the yellowish shade issue. Highly recommend and hope that NARS expands this line to include more neutral shades in the medium tone spectrum. If you are on the fence about this shade, I&#x27;d recommend, especially if your skin has a definite yellow-tan undertone. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> Great tinted moisturizer by Nars. IMO the best and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch. They usually don&#x27;t have a good coverage, have weird colors, makes you shiny or like ghost etc.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Laura Mercier one,very good but it was kind of heavy. Nars is really lightweight, has the best coverage ever. Almost like a foundation, but without heavy feeling and cakey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creamy consistency and blends beautiful. Sometimes I use it over bare skin and it looks great. Also very moisturizing, it leaves healthy natural glow without looking oily (like Laura Mercier&#x27;s TM). I don&#x27;t use powder over it, not even in my T-zone, but I have a normal skin. Good staying power, unless I will touch things with my face (like kissing and playing with my son), it will last the whole day. It might be other story on oily complexion or heavy moisturizer under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great for me, as a like yellow base, because it&#x27;s great to cover redness. I can use either Finland (winter time) or Alaska (summertime), they match me really well (MUFE HD foundation 120 which is perfectly between Finland and Alaska), Lorac Breakthrough Foundation SMS 4, Laura Mercier TM Nude, Laura Mercier Moisturizng foundation in Warm Ivory, Silk foundation in Medium Ivory, Clinique Even Better foundation in Buff, Stilla Illuminating Foundation 30 Watt, Korres Wild Rose WRF1, Tarte Recreate foundation #6 and Tarte TM Agent 10). To be honest Nars TM feels totally like Lorac Breakthrough foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone can not wear yellow tone make up I&#x27;d stay away from this TM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how well that would cover dark melasma spots. I had some in the past but got rid of them 95%, and my skin tone is not flawless (also acne scars, a bit of spider veins). For sure this tinted moisturizer makes skin more even.&lt;br /&gt;For this problem i would still use this TM, just cover problematic areas with either concealer or dab of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spf 30 is very good additional protection (because itcan be layered or  touch up later on), but without white cast on face (important- regular spf is needed under because make up spf is not considered as primary defense from the sun). The best thing I can tell about protection and great consistency is sometimes in the mid day my make up fades, I kiss my toddler son a lot;) Lately I use Make up for ever and when we go for a walk in the afternoon or go to the store etc. I apply Nars TM and have refreshed look with protection, very natural. Love that option, fast, convenient and actually saves money (I don;t have to remove make up, use spf cream and foundation again; and applying just spf moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t give this little coverage I like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look: great skin and no make up look, because it doesn&#x27;t mask skin completely so I can still see rosy cheeks through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone likes decent coverage and almost no feeling of make up this is worth to try. Especially when the price is similar to 1oz high end foundations, but the tube is 1.9 oz and you can squeeze last drop, unlike glass containers (I actually cut the tubes in half with any product and there is always decent amount of product left; cover bottom part with the top one and keep it in a ziplock bag to prevent drying or transfer leftover to mini jar from used cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star away because of the price, and when I applied more layers for beter coverage there&#x27;s no more \\&quot;no make up\\&quot; look. But this is personal and I am pretty sure most of the ladies would love this product.</li>
    <li> really like this product/not my first time purchase.  I would recommend trying it in a local shop to be sure you purchase the right shade for your skin.  Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 20, so it&#x27;s difficult to find tinted moisturizers which provide enough coverage for me. However, this was the ONLY product I used on my face all summer! I do find that not to be true for the past few months, though, and that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m not rating this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Have been a fan for 4 years!</li>
    <li> Provides nice, natural coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this formula! The coverage is perfect - more than a tired moisturizer but not as heavy as a foundation. No smell and smooth application. The medium was the perfect color for my blonde hair and light eyes. I am fair but with yellow undertones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely a tinted moisturiser girl and this works wonders. I am a Stromboli on Nars Sheers Glow and got the St. Moritz which is similar match, though St. Moritz doesn&#x27;t have much yellow to it. This compares close to Laura Mercier, and they both work beautifully. This is good for evening out the skin and creating a healthy look. It isn&#x27;t too dewy or matte. Always going to repurchase this!</li>
    <li> This tinted moisturizer is the best I have ever used!!! I have tried several brands from the cheap drug store kind, to forty dollar products from Macy&#x27;s. This stuff is not greasy, light coverage and stays all day! Best to top off with some sort of a powder for night wear, but just for day time it is perfect!!</li>
    <li> It is light but still has coverage. I have oily skin, but I don&#x27;t like cakey makeup.  It is great!</li>
    <li> This summer I have change my make up base for this moisturizer, I ussually use NC25-30 and this matches with my skin tone perfectly. It has a yellow undertone, which is perfect for redness. I use it with a neutral powder to reduce the brights because it has a glowy effect. For me it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to try tinted moisturizers as I generally need more coverage than they can offer. I had previously tried a couple BB creams. Which seemed to cover a bit better but were always a weird shade off from my skin tone.. Or any skin tone that resembles a human. I&#x27;ve been falling in love with NARS products as of late and discovered this amazing little product in a monthly subscription box and was in love. I had a bit of sticker shock when I saw the price. It costs almost as much as I spend on my Chanel foundation. And this would be my M-F daily wear foundation for gym.errands etc.. But it also has TWICE the amount of product. So that justified the purchase. It has lasted longer than expected and I plan to re-purchase when I run out. Theres no reason your daily foundation shouldn&#x27;t look flawless too!!</li>
    <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product and had to throw it away.  However, I liked the way it looked on before the reaction.  It took me awhile to realize that this product was causing the problem.  I used powder over it, and it stayed on all day. I liked the idea of a strong sunscreen.  Perhaps it will work better for you.</li>
    <li> This product is literally the easiest to apply. No primer needed and it lasts all day without feeling too dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the hot Az. sun!  Gives protection, hydration and just the right tint.</li>
    <li> Feels great, smells great, and looks great! I am so pleased. I was not sure what color would be a good match...the descriptions were very helpful</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Use as a moisturizer, but I find I can generally skip foundation and barely need concealer with it! Feels great, not greasy, good sun protection, and seems to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the St. Martiz. I am fairly pale, and have thin skin. Basically, you can see through me. Doctors have no trouble finding my veins. I have yellow undertones, though this shade is even yellow-er than I am. I was worried at first, but honestly, once I put it on and blended it, it looked great. No orange line at my jaw or wherever I stop. I get compliments on my complexion and just overall &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again and making it my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> 😊👍 I  love this stuff! It has Great coverage and perfect for those always on the run. SPF 30 is</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about the quality of NARS tinted moisturizer.  This has the smoothest, creamiest formula, and spreads so easily.  I don&#x27;t use a foundation anymore, since discovering NARS. The best way to describe it is....perfect.  You get it all in a one step application.</li>
    <li> This tinted moisturizer somehow makes my face look dry and oily at the same time. It makes my face shiny but it also gives it this weird powdery look that just isnt very cute. I wanted to love this because the color of it really matches my skin tone perfectly; it just doesnt lay on my skin right.</li>
</ol>
