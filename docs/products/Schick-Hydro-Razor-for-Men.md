      <li>Nice smooth shave just like the commercials say.</li>

      <li>Shick Hydro blade provides a nice, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>love the edger compared to the gillette model.</li>
      <li>I also like the lubrication strip on the Schick more, and feel it does a better job and lasts longer than the Gillette Fusion.</li>
      <li>It still feels comfortable to hold and gives a really nice close shave.</li>
      <li>- I received this item free from Schick for an honest review.  </li>
      <li>start, I love the grooming part of this razor.</li>
      <li>Love this thing works well</li>
      <li>Great trimmer - a bit bulky for a razor but fantastic as a trimmer and the right size in the hand</li>
      <li>I liked the original Hydro 5 and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
      <li>It makes for support clean edges and even does a nice eyebrow trim.</li>
      <li>They are some of the best blades around, so I was more curious about that nifty groomer end.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cost effective for my needs and trims my goatee to the right length after I mow the lawn surrounding it.</li>
      <li>The blades are sharp and the weight of the Schick is perfect.</li>
      <li>For one thing the vibrations seem to taper off very quickly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
      <li>Comes with 2 lithium batteries that are still going strong for me after about 3 months.</li>
      <li>overall though it provided a great smooth shave and edge combination</li>
      <li>so being waterproof is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>but the glades provided a smooth shave</li>
      <li>Here is my detailed breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this product free from Bzzagent.</li>
      <li>Close shave and smooth skin are the end result.</li>
      <li>I received a free razor from Schick  to try</li>
      <li>got this product free from schick.</li>

      <li>The regular face shaver razor works great</li>
      <li>I used this razor after my husband recieved it from bzzagent as a free trial.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
      <li>The Hydro 5 has left me with a very good first impression that could unseat the Slim Twin from its throne.</li>
      <li>More so than most, this razor and trimmer combo comes highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Battery install is quick and easy.</li>
      <li>This thing makes trimming up sideburns support quick and easy, which is the biggest weakness of the hydro 5 blade in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Despite all of the positive reviews, it feels bulky in your hand, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim very well, and the razor isn&#x27;t that good of quality.</li>
      <li>With a good shave cream, this thing barely feels like it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>Interesting Fact: The first electric razor was patented by Jacob Schick.</li>
      <li>This is great when I don&#x27;t have a beard, but I deducted a star for the width, which would make beard trend take twice as long.</li>
      <li>First off I love this razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still viable, though, and had a nice adjustable guard, so it&#x27;s at least a great travel</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still viable, though, and had a nice adjustable guard, so it&#x27;s at least a great travel</li>
      <li>and I like to clean under the clipper part anyway</li>

      <li>I received the Schick Hydro® 5 Groomer from Schick and I must say that I loved the Schick Hydro® 5 blades but with the groomer on the other side, it&#x27;s become my favorite when I travel.</li>
      <li>I just bought the Schick Hydro 5 Groomer this morning, and I honestly must say that it is by far</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re really into beards you&#x27;d be better off with a dedicated trimmer.</li>
      <li>The true test will be the Hydro 5&#x27;s longevity.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great razor I just wish it had the vibration built into it too.  I have a schick that does but I wanted this for the trimmer.  Still gets the job done and a great price</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer on this is much better than expected for it being so small and inexpensive. Blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t tug. And the green lotion strip or whatever it is called definitely eliminates irritation.</li>
    <li> Male version of the Hydro Silk. Don&#x27;t pay for pink tax ladies! Cheaper, just a different colour.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Schick Hydro 5 Groomer this morning, and I honestly must say that it is by far the BEST razor/groomer I have ever used! Smoothest shave I have gotten. No nicks or razor burn!!,for the first time in YEAR&#x27;S! and I only use water to shave (due to sensitive skin issues being allergic to all shaving cream) it is truly amazing!!! And the beard/body trimmer is amazing! BEST OF ALL ITS WATERPROOF!!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;It is also reasonably priced because the 5 in one combo is a steal!  I AM A USER FOR LIFE!! IF THIS PRODUCT GOES AWAY I&#x27;LL BE A LOST SOUL!! HAHA (that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m going to stock up incase my nightmare were to come true!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope I was able to help someone with my review!! THANK YOU SCHICK DOR THIS AMAZING PRODUCT!!!! YOU HAVE A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!</li>
    <li> Nice... the best shaver I ever had.</li>
    <li> I ordered this during my last deployment and it worked ok. Then I returned home and didn&#x27;t use it as much but kept it clean. After a few months of being home I began growing my beard again and went back to use it. I put a fresh battery and everything but it did not turn on. It is less then a year old and just stopped working. I give it a three star only because when it did work it got the job done.</li>
    <li> Love it!  And saved a few bucks from ordering the woman&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> I have used the 3, 4, and 5 blade cartridge razors before. None of them have REALLY added up to a shave that would justify me spending more money that I typically do on my trusty Schick Slim Twin razors. The Hydro 5 has left me with a very good first impression that could unseat the Slim Twin from its throne. I have very sensitive Irish skin that razor burns very easily, so I was expecting to be left more of the same. It just didn&#x27;t happen. The hydrating strip has seemed like a gimmick to me in the past on other razors, but this time it really does do what is advertised. My face was very smooth. I didn&#x27;t nick myself once and there was no razor burn. The Flip Trimmer did help a little when I was trying to get those hard to read hairs right next to my ears, but that wasn&#x27;t anything super special. The true test will be the Hydro 5&#x27;s longevity. Will it last past the 6 shave mark? *I received this product free from Bzzagent.*</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is a great product! The blades are sharp and the weight of the Schick is perfect. I also like the design and colors. The product is also great for grooming!</li>
    <li> I used this razor after my husband recieved it from bzzagent as a free trial. It came with two blades so we both tried it. We both agree that it gave a super close shave with out the irritation of our disposable Gillette. This will be our new brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great shave trimmer!  I love the 5 blades and the trimmer is perfect - no snags or catches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used blades before that could not get hard to reach places under nose, etc. This has a flip top trim blade to get those places and the trimmer works great too.  Got this product from Schick on a promo from BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Pretty cool. Worked well. The buzzer plastic piece keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have been looking for a razor that really shaves.  I have tried electric and many blade razors.  All left at least stubble.  This razor excels in shaving.  Absolutely the best I have ever used.  The groomer is just a plus.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro® 5 Groomer from Schick and I must say that I loved the Schick Hydro® 5 blades but with the groomer on the other side, it&#x27;s become my favorite when I travel. I am very picky about straight sideburns and the excess hair around the ears and I always carry a battery operated groomer with me in my toiletry bag when I travel. This is just the perfect combo.</li>
    <li> Great razor, good price.  Blades last a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for my husband&#x27;s light beard and mustache. also, good for sideburns trim with the groomer portion. However does not trim well for full head of hair or heavy beard. Great shaver and trimmer in one. Thank you Bzzagent for letting us try!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Schick Hydro 5 Groomer 4 in 1!! I received a free razor from Schick  to try and I was a little skeptical at first since I have mainly used Mach 3 in the past. Schick Hydro 5 Groomer leaves the closest shave possible and the trimmer is very precise. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a lot of other razors I have tried in the past. I will definitely make Schick Hydro 5 4 in 1 my new razor of choice!!</li>
    <li> I have to say that usually products that try to do two things at once fall short in some way, but that isn&#x27;t the case here. The groomer works great for trimming sideburns, beards and the razor is good for a nice close shave. Comes with 2 lithium batteries that are still going strong for me after about 3 months. Really recommend this set to anyone who needs to so both trimming and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free from schick.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free trial from shick as party of the shick hydro challenge. Going into this challenge, I already knew what a great shave the hydro 5 blades give. They are some of the best blades around, so I was more curious about that nifty groomer end. It sounded gimmicky, but actually is pretty legit. Here is my detailed breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort ****1/2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shick Hydro blade provides a nice, smooth shave. The hydrating reservoir actually works pretty well, and the razor glides over the face. I tried a shave without cream, with just wetting the blades after each pass and the shave remained comfortable and fairly close. With a good shave cream, this thing barely feels like it&#x27;s there. Also, I have yet to cut myself with this razor, which is a nice bonus. The shave feels equally nice going cross-grained or with the grain, and you can get a nice, close shave in either direction. My one complaint us that the length of the handle makes an upward pass under the chin awkward and sometimes results in scratching yourself with the trimmer end if it&#x27;s uncovered. The trimmer itself works well with no pinching or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of shave ****1/2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing cuts close. Seriously close. Like skip-a-day in the shave routine close. It definitely cuts closer on the upstroke or against the grain, and I found that an initial downstroke followed by the upstroke after a relather of cream provides the closest shave, one that is seriously close to a safety or straight edged shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for sideburns, the trimmer is actually pretty powerful for it&#x27;s single battery. The battery has lasted about 4 weeks thus far with no significant decline in power. This thing makes trimming up sideburns support quick and easy, which is the biggest weakness of the hydro 5 blade in my opinion. It makes for support clean edges and even does a nice eyebrow trim. This is great when I don&#x27;t have a beard, but I deducted a star for the width, which would make beard trend take twice as long. It&#x27;s still viable, though, and had a nice adjustable guard, so it&#x27;s at least a great travel option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a double-edged safety razor, this razor is at least twice as fast, even when making two passes. This thing will make quick work of any beard, including my week-long honeymoon stubble, which it breezed through with no more effort than usual. Not having to dig out the electric trimmer names it even faster when I have a day I need to trim it edge up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. I&#x27;ve put about a dozen shaves on this, and it is just finally starting to get full. Not bad for a cartridge razor, definitely no worse than any others that I&#x27;ve used. The hydrating gel reservoir does seem to be getting low, but still is working fine at the moment. I took off one star just because of the price. A typical safety razor replacement is about $0.15, so it&#x27;s definitely a pricier proposition even with the added longevity thrown in. The trimmer, as mentioned previously, is still running strong.for the width, which would make beard trend take twice as long.

    <li> I got a sample of the Schick Hydro 5 Groomer about 3 weeks ago. To this day it has been through a lot and it keeps amazing me after each use! I love the groomer attached. The shaver itself is amazing. Close shave and smooth skin are the end result. If you&#x27;re looking for a great shaver that comes with a groomer, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer - a bit bulky for a razor but fantastic as a trimmer and the right size in the hand - I received this item free from Schick for an honest review.  My son and husband both tried this and found the razor lacking but the trimmer worked great with their sideburns and stash.  Not a bad product at all.  Very close trimmer when needed or not</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Groomer in the mail on Friday from BzzAgent and used it for my first shave this Sunday evening...the aloe was very sticky and gooey after the razor end was rinsed in water a few times, something that doesn&#x27;t happen with my Schick disposable Slim Twin razor...but the glades provided a smooth shave, the groomer end provided a really nice neat slim cut on my sideburns and the edger helped me shave the small unreachable areas under my nostrils...only drawbacks were the movement of the razor itself, as my disposable is stationary and I feel more control that way, and the groomer console itself is very bulky in my hands...overall though it provided a great smooth shave and edge combination</li>
    <li> Better then I expected</li>
    <li> The regular face shaver razor works great however I find the body groomer too weak to do anything except slight touch ups and the size of the groomer is so small it takes forever to get anything done.</li>
    <li> I received this item from Schick to test out and share my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I love the grooming part of this razor. It&#x27;s cost effective for my needs and trims my goatee to the right length after I mow the lawn surrounding it. The guard has 3 levels you can adjust it to, which I had some problems with, but luckily I like it just right on its shortest setting. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain when you try to change the setting because it feels like its stuck and when you try to remove it to clean the little hairs off, the cap pops off. This can easily be snapped back on and I like to clean under the clipper part anyway so its no big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Schick Hydro 5 Razors, it&#x27;s pretty much the same but only with the added benefit of a beard trimmer that uses a single AAA battery. The cartridge is interchangeable with all other Hydro 5 Razors so you can choose to make this a sensitive razor as well if you&#x27;d like. It still feels comfortable to hold and gives a really nice close shave. Unfortunately, I will no longer be a user of this feature since I suffer from the unsightly razor bumps. If you happen to be a sufferer as well, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently learned from my dermatologist that I will continue to get razor bumps as long as I shave with a razor and that it would only get worst with every blade added to it. In this case, Schick has 5. I believe this is no fault of the razor itself, but instead the wrong option for grooming my facial hair. When the hair follicle is shaved so close and sharp, the hair in turn becomes a mini razor. And since my hair is curly, it curls around and punctures my skin resulting in a nasty looking bump of ingrown hair. I have tried different products which have helped a lot, but it never completely eliminated it and was always too costly. Tend Skin was probably the best but way too expensive. I always wanted to switch over to a foil shaver since I always heard amazing things about them, I just didn&#x27;t want to plop down a ton of money for the one I wanted yet. Since the benefits outweigh the initial cost and I need a smooth face for the Fire Academy, I finally bit the bullet and bought a Braun Series 7. Its still too early to write a comprehensive review on it but I can tell you that I am already seeing very positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting Fact: The first electric razor was patented by Jacob Schick.y for the one I wanted yet.

    <li> I have a light beard and goatee and this razor works great. I liked the original Hydro 5 and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The blades last longer than most, and it gives a smooth, close shave with no nicks or bumps. I like the fact you can flip back the top of the blade reservoir to trim areas you couldn&#x27;t with it down. Very handy. This razor is also water resistant,  so you can confidently use it in the shower and rinse it with no worries. The grooming part does a nice job with side burns and longer hairs. Also works nice on detailing the beard and goatee. The size of the trimmer is great for getting under the nose and behind the ears. It only takes one lithium battery and is still pretty powerful. It hasn&#x27;t yanked  my hair yet. With the replacement blades being so affordable. More so than most, this razor and trimmer combo comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great Combo! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I bought the same razor 3 years ago and am now replacing it, the new one is crap the groomer broke the first time I used it,now the button will not stay down and to use it I have to manually hold the button and try to trim at the same time. Shame on you Schick.</li>
    <li> Love this thing works well</li>
    <li> This is the male version of the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer for women. Use it in your normal routine for face shaves and the trimmer for sideburns or mustache/goatee work... but if you&#x27;re really into beards you&#x27;d be better off with a dedicated trimmer. Or keep it in the shower (it&#x27;s waterproof) for grooming and shaving your nether regions. I wish it came with a suction-cup wall mount like some other Schick razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer stays on if you long press the button, but the motor is only at the trimmer end, so it does not add any vibration to the shaving side. The battery included is a lithium ultimate, and I suggest you continue to use them over other brands, but even that seems to die too soon - maybe after about 3 weeks of use. Regular alkaline die in 2-3 weeks. The problem isn&#x27;t that they are dead, just that they don&#x27;t have enough voltage to run the little motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick hydro 5 is a large 5-blade head, due to the current market trend to increase blade-count under the guise of less irritation, albeit at slightly costlier razor cartridges, but the lubrication strip can be flipped up to make the razor somewhat smaller.  It does not offer the detail work of the single blade on the Gillette fusion. The entire razor/trimmer feels big in the hand compared to normal razors, but there are lots of bumps for grip and handling it isn&#x27;t difficult. I find it works well for body shaving. I just wish the battery lasted longer (like in a Gillette Fusion). I also like the lubrication strip on the Schick more, and feel it does a better job and lasts longer than the Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is nice. The razor is great. I wish it had the vibration function for the razor though. Without that I can only rate it 3 stars</li>
    <li> this was 5$ cheaper than even in walmart , I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye out for the blades now too</li>
    <li> Nice smooth shave just like the commercials say. Haven&#x27;t cut myself once either knock on wood.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor- I have shaved probably ten times already with the same blade and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
    <li> Received this product free from Schick and was happy to give it a try. With the two in one design, it&#x27;s cleared up some space in my drawer in the bathroom as i don&#x27;t have to keep my groomer and old razors. The groomer is powerful enough to keep my sideburns and eyebrows in check, while the razor is everything i expect from Schick.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a battery and is ready to go out of the box. Battery install is quick and easy. If you&#x27;re looking for something that travels well and gets the job done, give this product a try.</li>
    <li> First off I love this razor. It gives a very smooth shave. I use it in the shower so being waterproof is a huge plus. HOWEVER, I am now on my third one in under 6 months as the inner mechanics seem to fail. For one thing the vibrations seem to taper off very quickly. Meaning with a new battery its a strong vibration but that rapidly moves to a weaker pulsing within a couple uses. More disturbing, the contacts for the battery seem to be a pro design. Often times the razor won&#x27;t turn on unless you open and close (by twisting) the battery compartment. After playing with it that does the trick usually. But like one reviewer noted, the ON/OFF button is not the best and makes for some frustrating antics standing in the shower trying to twist the housing while pushing the button in the hopes of getting an ON unit. My last one completely died after two months whence the third unit I&#x27;m getting. I&#x27;d be tempted to go elsewhere but I like this product but I really wish they had a next generation where these annoying faults were corrected. I have every other day my face and head so it gets a lot of use.</li>
    <li> These blades suck I used it one time worked great then you throw it in the trash after first use it just combs your facial hair I prefer shick quatro hate trying new things but trying to save money cause we had a cupon doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star but it&#x27;s required don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> The perfect travel shaver / groomer</li>
    <li> FINALLY A RAZOR THAT CLEANS MY NECK. THE TRIMMER WORKS GOOD. AMOZONS PRICE IS GREAT. I NOTICED THE MULTI BLADES ARE FARTHER APART. IF I DONT SHAVE ONCE A DAY I HAVE TO USE A CHEAP 2 BLADE FIRST . ALL OTHER BLADES YANK THE HAIR. NOT THIS ONE 3 DAYS AND IT SHAVED LIKE  A OLD STYLE SINGLE BLADE. Some complained about it emptying the aloe after a few weeks, but the blade lasted 3-4 more weeks. COME ON GUYS ! 10.00 for replacement blades. Best shave I have ever given myself. And im 50.</li>
    <li> Mediocre. I&#x27;m really not impressed with this razor/trimmer combo. Despite all of the positive reviews, it feels bulky in your hand, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim very well, and the razor isn&#x27;t that good of quality. The gel on the lubricating strip sometimes gets caked up and is raised up off of the razor, preventing a close shave. I&#x27;ve been using Schick products for awhile now but I think it&#x27;s time to make the switch to something else.</li>
    <li> Love this razor compared to the Gillette 3 in 1 groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main reason is the razor and groomer are on opposite sides so i don&#x27;t need to change out the tip to shave, trim, and groom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the gillette 3 in 1 had everything on the same end so you need to take things off to access different features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives a really clean shave and the moisturizing reservoir is much larger in capacity than leading competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the power button is a little tough to press in order to get it into the &amp;#34;stay on&amp;#34; mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the edger compared to the gillette model. It takes the guess work out because the razor is on the actual edge of the razor, whereas that gillette is slighty lower than the edge, so you would have to guess where you are trimming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of groomers, I really prefer this one as it is very efficient and I can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this razor</li>
