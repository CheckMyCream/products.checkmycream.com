      <li>i find it amazing that anyone has had success with this gel.</li>
      <li>Great product for the price and does not hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>

      <li>i have use this product before and it worked ok and if you thinking about getting its worth the money you spend to buy this product</li>

      <li>I saw a huge difference after just 1 use; actually didn&#x27;t have to use it more than 2 more times to get where I wanted.</li>
      <li>def takes multiple 1 hr sessions to get good results</li>
      <li>w/ twice daily use, this is a good whitening gel.</li>
      <li>It sounds too good to be true, but it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price, but no four stars because of the discomfort factor - stings and causes some swelling on gums, something I haven&#x27;t encountered with other gels.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>but at the same time, I think it&#x27;s just better to spend more money for something that sticks to the teeth.</li>
      <li>great, did 3 weeks, my teeth really turned white</li>

      <li>It is fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I try this gel for the first time and it works!</li>
      <li>Works great, inexpensive, I use everyday before my toothpaste and my teeth are whiter.</li>
      <li>It does seem to whiten quickly, though, so if you&#x27;re willing to endure some discomfort</li>
      <li>but it comes right off.</li>
      <li>I could see a difference right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d reccommend buying your own soft mouthguards instead of wasting your time on the whole kit, the gel itself is way cheaper and the rinse doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
      <li>I love how white it leaves my teeth and how fast it is!</li>
      <li>funny thing i bought like 2 of them</li>
      <li>(2 x day for first 2 wks)</li>
      <li>I only ever experienced sensitivity if I left it on much longer than recommended - 30</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had so many different people ask me how I get my teeth</li>
      <li>I agree with one reviewer that this product produces a bright white, not a blue-ish white like some strips.</li>
      <li>buy one of those little blue light mouth guards and your good to go.</li>
      <li>So much cheaper than anything else out there</li>
      <li>shipped fast too.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really work because i saw no difference.</li>
      <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
      <li>PlusWhite 5 Minute whitener is absolutely the easiest and fastest tooth-whitening gel on the market, bar none.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses this product after noticing how well it works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking and looking for a reasonably priced whitener for a while.</li>
      <li>Really work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are one of those unfortunates that still use tobacco, it will take much longer to see results.</li>
      <li>PlusWhite is the happiest medium: a gel (so it covers the whole tooth and gets into crevices)</li>
      <li>When picking up this product I was more scared about getting sensitive teeth than actually getting my teeth whiter and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an awesome teeth whitening gel. Every time I go to the dentist I always get asked if I have done their bleaching treatments, since my teeth are so white. I use the product every other week to remove the stains from coffee, tea and wine. It works incredibly well...highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
    <li> Works great, noticeable difference in a week or so if you have your own teeth trays. If you are one of those unfortunates that still use tobacco, it will take much longer to see results. Not a miracle drug just a product that delivers as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this forever and loveee it! Good price! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Used three times and have seen great improvement already!</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time last night. I could see a difference right away. I only left the gel on my teeth for 5 or 6 minutes and found my teeth to be 3 shades whiter. I don&#x27;t think I need to apply every day but this is definitely worth more than the price!</li>
    <li> It does the trick, but it makes your teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> great, did 3 weeks, my teeth really turned white</li>
    <li> I think it removes stains, but doesn&#x27;t whiten so well.  I like it because it&#x27;s inexpensive, quick, and does brighten my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is fast and easy to use. Just add a little to a toothbrush and brush where you want it. Leave it on for a few minutes, then rinse. I love how white it leaves my teeth and how fast it is! It is inexpensive too, which is a plus! A tube lasts a very long time, as a little bit goes a long way. I probably use it every two weeks, as I am a heavy coffee drinker. This is the best whitener out there for the money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. The change was noticeable within a couple uses, and I actually received compliments on the whiteness of my teeth, which never happened while using Crest 3D white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;- easy&lt;br /&gt;- fast&lt;br /&gt;- effectives&lt;br /&gt;- little to no sensitivity (though my teeth aren&#x27;t extremely sensitive to start with. I only ever experienced sensitivity if I left it on much longer than recommended - 30+ minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- messy</li>
    <li> Best whiteness ever received!</li>
    <li> Like the teeth whitening product.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t complain,appears to have a whitening effect when used regularly.will buy again,have at least 7  tubes left that have to be used before  another order.&lt;br /&gt;  one of the few firms on the market that uses peroxide is plus white,unobtainable from  british retailers here in the southern counties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  quite satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Price is right for basic whitening.</li>
    <li> i put on this on my teeth twice a day for at least 20 minutes not 5 minutes but 20. It didn&#x27;t really work because i saw no difference. i do have a bit of yellowing on my teeth nothing to bad thats why i tried it. i even used it with a mouth tray and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother was like &#x27;&#x27;you want the thing to work instantly?&#x27;&#x27; i was like of course they said 5 mins i gave it 20-30 minutes twice a day. Waste of my time. funny thing i bought like 2 of them ugh WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> Slight improvement-one shade lighter on teeth.  Prompt shipping,</li>
    <li> Great price, but no four stars because of the discomfort factor - stings and causes some swelling on gums, something I haven&#x27;t encountered with other gels.  (This only happens if you whiten twice a day - use it once a day and you won&#x27;t notice stinging or tooth sensitivity.) It does seem to whiten quickly, though, so if you&#x27;re willing to endure some discomfort w/ twice daily use, this is a good whitening gel.</li>
    <li> I will confess I have only used this a few times but I can see a difference already. I applied with a q-tip being careful to keep it off my gums. I just can&#x27;t afford white strips anymore so i can&#x27;t wait to get on schedule with this stuff. (2 x day for first 2 wks) I can&#x27;t believe the low price too!</li>
    <li> PlusWhite 5 Minute whitener is absolutely the easiest and fastest tooth-whitening gel on the market, bar none. Other gels like Rembrandt can (and have) caused things like chemical burns and lesions in the mouth from being too intense, while other varieties like Crest don&#x27;t work at all, and only serve to whiten the flat surfaces of teeth (leaving unseemly hello lines between teeth, as those crevices are deep). PlusWhite is the happiest medium: a gel (so it covers the whole tooth and gets into crevices) that works well, works quickly, and works safely. No burns, no spots of lighter or darker enamel, and WHITE TEETH. The gel can be applied using a tray (recommended) or by simply brushing it on with a toothbrush. I add a small amount to my toothbrush a few days a week (with toothpaste), and it works just fine. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great, inexpensive, I use everyday before my toothpaste and my teeth are whiter.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have a calcium deficiency causing my teeth to become almost two-toned (darker at the top). This product not only evens out the color of my teeth, it brings them at least two shades lighter. I love this stuff. I always receive compliments on how white my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try it!!</li>
    <li> It sounds too good to be true, but it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive gums, be sure you buy the sensitive version (I have found it works equally as well).</li>
    <li> good product. works good</li>
    <li> Used it once and noticed a difference already !! :)&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy!&lt;br /&gt; Shipped quick!</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be better than the strips. I agree with one reviewer that this product produces a bright white, not a blue-ish white like some strips. The tray is soft and comfortable. I don&#x27;t usually use the rinse. I had compliments after the first use. This is very economical compared to the $trips. My whole family uses this product after noticing how well it works. No problems with sensitivity, even when I leave it on a little longer than the recommended time.</li>
    <li> these gels are all useless, just peroxide in a past form. Its not good to use peroxide on your teeth regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m recommending this whitening product to people who want brighter teeth.  I started on a Monday and began seeing results by Thursday. I use the blue mouth guard featured on the side of the box. (purchased at Walmart). I use the product anywhere from 5-20m., two times a day, depending on how busy I am.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any tooth sensitivity, it&#x27;s fast and neat to use with no messy strips to dispose of.  It gets to all my teeth, unlike the strips, which only work on the front.  For me this routine is faster and cheaper. I brush afterward using my regular toothpaste along with a squirt of Colgate Optic White. I hope to see more as the week progresses.</li>
    <li> Product does not work. It says 5mins, but you actually have to leave it on for 20+ mins.</li>
    <li> Seeing a slight inprovement. However, my teeth are not that stained to begin with. Great product for the price and does not hurt my sensitive teeth. Be careful not to leave it on too long, especially if you get it on your gums.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product by researching online. I&#x27;ve been looking and looking for a reasonably priced whitener for a while. I use this with a mouth guard, and am amazed at what a good job it does. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> Have used product before! Very effective in whitening teeth&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy/use product as long as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO REGRETS!!!!!</li>
    <li> This does nothing for me but maybe, after a week+ of constant use for over 20-minutes (read reviews; they recommend leaving it on for that length of time) with perfectly fitting trays removing the very yellow stains by my gums; but they&#x27;re still not white WHITE.  The stains come back quickly.  I am not a die-hard coffee drinker, but I do drink tea, soda, am a big fan of chocolate, etc.  No smoking though but I guess I have porous teeth.  This just isn&#x27;t doing it and it&#x27;s my second attempt with the stuff; tube is almost finished.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My friend had her teeth whitened at her dentist and they didn&#x27;t turn out half as well as mine.  She started using this too and loves it.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s good product. .i still use it and i will tell you  a bout it</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as stated</li>
    <li> i have use this product before and it worked ok and if you thinking about getting its worth the money you spend to buy this product</li>
    <li> I saw a huge difference after just 1 use; actually didn&#x27;t have to use it more than 2 more times to get where I wanted. Surprising, because the area under my crowns was pretty yellow! This bleached all that right out and cost less than those whitestrips.</li>
    <li> I try this gel for the first time and it works! My teeth got much whiter after just 7 days, and the price is great. I highly recommend this  product.</li>
    <li> best price I have ever found this product for. shipped fast too.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product i&#x27;ve been using it for 8 years</li>
    <li> Thank-you, it arrived promptly &amp; I Love this product. It works well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
    <li> Good, no  sensitivity.</li>
    <li> works great, super cheap, don&#x27;t get on your gums!  buy one of those little blue light mouth guards and your good to go. I have my kids use it too</li>
    <li> As advertised. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference, and it has been almost 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am giving this three stars because it works, however there are side effects that are really annoying. One thing I noticed is after using my gums become very sensitive and even slightly inflamed. Second it causes Cracking on the corners of my mouth aka (Angular Cheilitis) the first time I used the product the next morning I had a cut on the side of my mouth, I ignored it thinking it was something else and it only got worse. When it finally cleared up, I tried the product again, thinking it was only coincidental but alas, within an hour I had a crack on the side of my mouth again, which is painful and takes forever to heal. So if you have sensitive skin I would skip this product. I took care to not get any on the side of my mouths when using but strangely I still got the cracks....but if you want white teeth and don&#x27;t care to have irritated gums/lips...this will whiten your smile.</li>
    <li> I am always getting compliments on my teeth and I credit Plus White. I did make my own mouth guard and I think that&#x27;s the key to the best results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite sometime now. When picking up this product I was more scared about getting sensitive teeth than actually getting my teeth whiter and the low price made me even more nervous about this product; however, this I&#x27;ve used the whole gel tube and it left with me no sensitivity and actually left my teeth a shade whiter! Only problem I have with this product is that it caused sores in my mouth and made my lips raw and it is very hard to avoid getting the gel on anything but your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, it&#x27;s cheap and left me with no sensitivity, and the only problem I have with this product is that it can cause sores and raw lips.</li>
    <li> For the price, this works well but at the same time, I think it&#x27;s just better to spend more money for something that sticks to the teeth. I bought trays to go with this but it still didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I had trouble with this one.  My teeth are still aching and it&#x27;s been days on end since I&#x27;ve used this product.  If you want white, try the dentist.  It&#x27;s more expensive but worth it.  I&#x27;m off to get some Sensodyne toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening product on the market and its less expensive than other products too.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  One tube lasts so long that I cannot tell you how long it lasts.  Whitens nicely with the trays I got from my dentist.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Need a mouth tray with it.</li>
    <li> does NOT work. been using this product for four days now. i apply it twice daily for 15 minutes using separately purchased mouth trays. the product is very messy and has produced zero results thus far. i find it amazing that anyone has had success with this gel. i&#x27;ll be making an appointment tomorrow with my dentist to have a professional whitening for $99. i&#x27;d rather pay that amount for instant results than have to go thru this everyday and see no change. i would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service. A++</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. So much cheaper than anything else out there and it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. I use those sports guard things that you boil in water as trays and use it while I&#x27;m in the shower so I don&#x27;t get all drooley. Don&#x27;t use the tray that comes with the kit, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve had so many different people ask me how I get my teeth so white and I tell them to use this! Don&#x27;t use it for too many days in a row or else it can irritate your gums. You&#x27;re not supposed to get it on your gums anyway but sometimes a little gets on anyway. It&#x27;s nothing compared to the sensitivity the crest white strips can cause. Can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough.</li>
    <li> Nice bleaching he. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> if i had a pic i would send you my teeth GREAT</li>
    <li> Works great.. Can also be purchased at the Dollar Tree for 1$!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I am including these next few words becasue Amazon requires it. That needs to be changed.</li>
    <li> Item came in a torn open container. I was excited to try the product but don&#x27;t want to use a possibly opened used item.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Really work.&lt;br /&gt; Is it amazing.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years, and it really does work! Use as directed, and you&#x27;ll see fast, great results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over five years now. It is cheap and effective. If you just follow the directions on the tube, you will get results!&lt;br /&gt;I just bought mouth trays from amazon for $3.99, boiled them and now have my own custom trays</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly 10 years with awesome success. I add it to EVERY brushing (twice a day). Kept my teeths sparkling white and clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the gel again and not the runny liquid.&lt;br /&gt;It def takes multiple 1 hr sessions to get good results and I don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee, but I do drink tea once a day.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great, especially if you are looking to brighten your teeth without having them look too crazy blueish white. i&#x27;ve tried those crest whitestrips in the past and after only 1 use my teeth were KILLING ME. they felt like i&#x27;d brushed my teeth with a brick, they were throbbing and sensitive and stayed that way for almost a week. not the case with this gel, you can leave it on the max time which is 20 mins every single day and you won&#x27;t feel any pain or sensitivity. the whitening is also noticeably better than any other method, you notice IMMEDIATELY and it only has to be touched up maybe once a week after you get the result you want. just be careful of your gums, it will bleach them a bit if it gets on them but it comes right off. I&#x27;d reccommend buying your own soft mouthguards instead of wasting your time on the whole kit, the gel itself is way cheaper and the rinse doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
    <li> Best price on Teeth Whitening.</li>
