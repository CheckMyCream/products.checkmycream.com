      <li>Fabulous cleanser!  </li>
      <li>I have asked Amazon for a refund on this, I love the texture and the smell but</li>
      <li>I need to buy more</li>
      <li>and I have seen a difference in my skin texture being better since I started using it.</li>
      <li>but gd to use:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Compare to Bobbi Brown, Eve lom cleans better.</li>
      <li>I use it most every night and use the morning cleanser every morning.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It feels very nice applying and does melt make-up including really stubborn eye make up off in seconds.</li>
      <li>Very clean smelling.</li>
      <li>The peeling from using retin a was greatly reduced and my skin feels so baby soft.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable, has continued to buy good stuff.</li>
      <li>Viola, you feel a difference even after the first use (ok, you have to follow all the steps in the direction, no cheating!)</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Coupled with a good night sleep, you gonna find a nice glow when you wake up next morning!</li>
      <li>It is not as strong as I</li>
      <li>/&gt;The container came and the package was beautiful, white and rich-looking.</li>
      <li>This is good natural product!</li>
      <li>my skin feel so comfortable when using the product.</li>
      <li>My Skin feels so smooth after using it.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>If you are not acne prone or have sensitive skin, this may be a good fit for you.</li>
      <li>me just say one good thing about it, it does seem to take off your face makeup very well, which is another reason why I was so interested in it.</li>
      <li>After a week of using this, I had such an amazing glow!</li>
      <li>I love this product and used it last many, many years ago when I was still living in London.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much!</li>
      <li>I bought this product after trying a sample and initially liked it but after using it daily for more than a week I found the cleanser to be quite drying on my skin.</li>
      <li>I simply clean my cloth after I clean my face with a castile soap bar and it looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling refreshed, glowing and super smooth.</li>
      <li>This Eve Lom cleanser proved to me that my acne prone face needed a more gentle non-stripping wash that balanced my skin instead of drying it out.</li>
      <li>Cool.</li>
      <li>Once you apply on your face, and makes circular motion as directed, you will feel a bit of warm sensation and the grainy part actually exfoliates your skin gently and feels kinda nice</li>
      <li>and I believe this cleanser is one of the main changes I made that has improved my acne tremendously!!</li>
      <li>After using this product for a week I had no new breakouts which was amazing!</li>
      <li>I know, I know, this product&#x27;s first ingredient is mineral oil!  </li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth price.</li>
      <li>and I rarely have that problem with any skin cleansers.</li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny</li>
      <li>it does as claimed and came pretty quick</li>
      <li>Then I rub the product in a bit more gently, then wash off normally with muslin cloth.</li>
      <li>I only use it when I wear make-up, and it does a great job of removing every last trace.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant and first because it is like rubbing oil on your face, but it comes off easily and leaves my face feeling clean, and balanced with no residue left on the skin.</li>
      <li>Cannot live without it, gets my skin so clean without drying it out and leaves me with glowing.</li>
      <li>I have this one and also from Sephora, the product is very different in consistency, color and texture than the one I know to be authentic from Sephora.</li>
      <li>The next day she brought me a sample and swore I would love</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else ever;)</li>
      <li>leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I take a bowl and put hot water in it, put the cleanser on my face and work it in gently.</li>
      <li>money is not a problem for you, I would strongly recommend it for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did use the accompanying muslin cloth as well as a regular wash cloth and both worked fine to remove the cleanser.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this product after trying a sample and initially liked it but after using it daily for more than a week I found the cleanser to be quite drying on my skin. The texture is a thick solid balm that melts into an oily substance upon application. It feels very nice applying and does melt make-up including really stubborn eye make up off in seconds. I did use the accompanying muslin cloth as well as a regular wash cloth and both worked fine to remove the cleanser. If I wasnt wearing much make-up I could just rinse my face to remove it. However, it was quite dehydrating and left my oily prone skin feeling parched and dry with some flaky patches even though I was still producing oil like a Texas refinery.  This might work for a different skintype but it didn&#x27;t work for mine, The seller was great though. Fast and as promised.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without it, gets my skin so clean without drying it out and leaves me with glowing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this cleanser but my skin has never been better. I have always used high end skin care and makeup but the pms breakout got me every month. Also my BB Cream seemed to make me breakout if used everyday and I almost quit using it.  It&#x27;s been two months since using Eve Lom and NO breakouts. Not even a pimple. Love love love!</li>
    <li> Loved this cleanser. Made my skin feel very soft. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am really questioning that this product is real Eve Lom.  I have this one and also from Sephora, the product is very different in consistency, color and texture than the one I know to be authentic from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I have asked Amazon for a refund on this, I love the texture and the smell but&lt;br /&gt;it causes my skin to breakout and I rarely have that problem with any skin cleansers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. My face feels great after using. I have combo skin.</li>
    <li> Please do yourself a favor if you have acne, save your money and just go see a good dermatologist. It will save you a lot of time, money and disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, REALLY wanted this stuff to work. And I tried, I really, truly tried. I am 34 years old, and break out like a pubescent 15 year old. Not just at \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;. I break out all the time. I was about to give up, when a coworker recommended this product to me. She didn&#x27;t just recommend it to me, she ranted and raved about it. The next day she brought me a sample and swore I would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say one good thing about it, it does seem to take off your face makeup very well, which is another reason why I was so interested in it. If you are not acne prone or have sensitive skin, this may be a good fit for you. It does not take off mascara or heavy eye makeup very well at all, use eye makeup remover for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the sample, which contained about 2 applications. I woke up the next day, no new zits. Cool. So that day, I researched Eve Lom online and there were TONS of great reviews. Sure, there were some bad ones, but you can&#x27;t please everyone. I decided to order the smallest container to see if I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container came and the package was beautiful, white and rich-looking. I could have sworn the box was even \\&quot;scented\\&quot;. So far so good. I dove right in, started using the stuff that same night. The next morning I woke up, no new zits. Coool.... so that day, around lunchtime, I was feeling my face and felt a small painful lump in my cheek. GREAT. Another zit. Oh well, I figured, it was just clearing out my pores. I continued on with the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I woke up with a new ripe zit on my cheek (from the one that was forming the following day) and a new one above my left eyebrow. Awesome. I kept going, as I read reviews saying \\&quot;the skin has to purge\\&quot; and whatnot. I also consulted my coworker who insisted I keep going. The next morning I woke up with 2 new whiteheads under my bottom lip. I had it. I know maybe I am \\&quot;purging\\&quot;, but I got scared! My boyfriend&#x27;s party was next weekend and I can&#x27;t be all broken out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did what I should have done since day 1, is go see a good dermatologist. A DOCTOR. Not an esthetictian, not a holistic hippie, a doctor. She prescribed me some topical prescriptions and my skin is well on the way to recovery. It has only been a week with the prescriptions and already it is working miracles. As I said before, if you have acne, save your money and go see a doctor.s under my bottom lip. I had it. I know maybe I am \\&quot;purging\\&quot;, but I got scared! My boyfriend&#x27;s party was next weekend and I can&#x27;t be all broken out!    I did what I should have done since day 1, is go see a good dermatologist. A DOCTOR. Not an esthetictian, not a holistic hippie, a doctor. She prescribed me some topical prescriptions and my skin is well on the way to recovery. It has only been a week with the prescriptions and already it is working miracles. As I said before, if you have acne, save your money and go see a doctor.</li>
    <li> Good quality but still too pricy</li>
    <li> i quite liked it. I&#x27;ll have to use more</li>
    <li> I am 70 years young and this is the best cleanser I have ever used. The only thing that removes dry skin, makeup, etc. and keeps the face feeling soft and luxurious, 24-7. I use it most every night and use the morning cleanser every morning. Sometimes I just use the morning cleanser twice a day. I absolutely love it. Very clean smelling.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product for awhile before I saw it here and the price was within my budget. I love this product so much! I feel like it gets my dry skin really clean and I have seen a difference in my skin texture being better since I started using it. I found Eve Lom with this shipper for a great price and they also got it too me quickly!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price but it really is the best cleanser out there. Since it is so expensive, I can only use it once or twice a week, but it is so worth it - Those days my skin looks it&#x27;s best. Amazon is by far the cheapest way to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing face cleanser. The best I have used ever. I even recommended it to my friend and she ordered one for herself and loved it. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> my skin feel so comfortable when using the product. also, smell is soothing.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this cleanser!  I only use it when I wear make-up, and it does a great job of removing every last trace.  Do yourself a favor and get some extra muslin cloths with this so that you don&#x27;t have to keep washing the one it comes with (look for cheaper cloths on this site).  I find you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to clean your whole face, so this 50ml has lasted me several months (also I don&#x27;t use it nightly).  I will be repurchasing this.  Even though it is definitely a splurge item, I feel that this is a product that does what it claims to very well, treats my skin well, and has improved the texture and quality of my skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling refreshed, glowing and super smooth. I love the natural smell of essential oils it has. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a one-time splurge, but this has a new home in my cabinet from now on. The beauty &amp;#34;ritual&amp;#34; takes no more than five minutes IF you&#x27;re being leisurely, and is soothing after a long day. I&#x27;ve used Eve Lom every night since I bought it, and my skin was so improved that my hard to impress relatives are buying it now. I did buy another three pack of the muslin cloths here on Amazon; they may only be woven cloths, but they are gentle on the skin and don&#x27;t overwork my pores like my Clairsonic did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that the product contains parabens, but this is the one cleanser my skin has responded to--I&#x27;ve spent years trying ProActiv, Beauty Control, Bare Minerals, organic products, Clairsonic, and I never would have left the house without makeup. I did last weekend, and my mom didn&#x27;t believe it was my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it: maybe it works for you too.</li>
    <li> Star product, I often buy a cleaning product. The price is reasonable, has continued to buy good stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleansing! This is good natural product! I will highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Look no further. I see my skin looking more radiant and youthful after only a few days. I have dry skin sometimes and oily skin other times. This seems to work all the time. Worth price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I am 30 and have acne prone skin. For the last year I have been using the obagi nu derm system with retin a to try and get rid of the skin discoloration and acne. The foaming cleanser included in the obagi system was too harsh and drying. This Eve Lom cleanser is perfect. I was hesitant and first because it is like rubbing oil on your face, but it comes off easily and leaves my face feeling clean, and balanced with no residue left on the skin. After using this product for a week I had no new breakouts which was amazing! The peeling from using retin a was greatly reduced and my skin feels so baby soft. The muslin cloth that comes with this cleanser is the perfect amount of exfoliation for the skin, you really don&#x27;t need anything else. This cleanser removed ALL blackheads from my face in only the first 3 days!! I was totally shocked. I use this once in the morning and once at night. After washing I use my toner and then my regular skin care system. Once a week I take my time at night washing with this. I take a bowl and put hot water in it, put the cleanser on my face and work it in gently. Then I lean over the bowl with a towel over my head and steam for 3 minutes. Then I rub the product in a bit more gently, then wash off normally with muslin cloth. If you have acne you probably have a face wash that is supposed to strip the oil off your face. This Eve Lom cleanser proved to me that my acne prone face needed a more gentle non-stripping wash that balanced my skin instead of drying it out. If you are not sure, sephora carries this and you can go into one by you and ask them for a sample to try. LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> I really like all Eve Lom products; this cleaners smells, cleans and feels wonderful on my skin. Like the  TLC Cream a little goes along way. This product is worth every penny</li>
    <li> Fabulous product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time and she has very sensitive skin. It seems to work like a charm. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Smell kinda odd but gd to use:)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been looking for, leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. After a week of using this, I had such an amazing glow!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT IN EVERY ASPECT, except it is more expensive than other similar cleansers, such as Bobbi Brown and Shu umuera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to admit that I am very picky when I choose a cleanser as I have sensitive and combination skin. I like something that does not irritate my skin and at the same time remove my make up (I usually put on BB cream, mineral powder, blush, eyeliner, eye shadow and mascara) COMPLETELY. This cleanser with its cloth do it perfectly. My skin feels nourished and cleaned after using it. It does not dry out my skin and my skin feels supple. It creates NO IRRITATION OR REDNESS on my skin. No allergic reaction the next day. Thank you. I simply clean my cloth after I clean my face with a castile soap bar and it looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL: I like the smell. It is not as strong as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASE OF APPLICATION: Easy to apply. I like to massage my face with it. You cannot massage your face with other cleansing oil, like shu umuera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money is not a problem for you, I would strongly recommend it for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare to Bobbi Brown, Eve lom cleans better. No make up residue left on face.</li>
    <li> I love this product and used it last many, many years ago when I was still living in London. I love it, the only down side for me is that it&#x27;s a little time consuming, I like to wash and go as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li> I know, I know, this product&#x27;s first ingredient is mineral oil!  But my skin LOVES it!  It totally cleared up my adult acne.  A little bit goes a long way, so the 50ml lasts me well over a month of 1x daily use in the evening. It really melts off any makeup and the massage directions that come with the cleanser are relaxing and seem to have helped with facial puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I wish this wasn&#x27;t made with cheap-o mineral oil?  Of course.  But my skin hasn&#x27;t been happier, so I&#x27;ll keep on using it until I find something that works as well!</li>
    <li> The best cleanser I have ever had. My Skin feels so smooth after using it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser feels like a facial every day! I have been battling adult acne and I believe this cleanser is one of the main changes I made that has improved my acne tremendously!! I won&#x27;t use anything else ever;)</li>

    <li> LOVE EVELOM for winter! I was first introduced to this product at the spaceNK Apothecary store, it is a store I LOVE because they curate and stock products they believe in, and I have quite some happy purchases with them! Ok, back to the product, the consistency of the product at first kinda turned me off a little, it looked/felt like solidified fat (with some grainy parts in it), it has a bit of medicine smell but not potent. Once you apply on your face, and makes circular motion as directed, you will feel a bit of warm sensation and the grainy part actually exfoliates your skin gently and feels kinda nice, I usually take at least 3 to 5 minutes for this part until it feels kinda dried up, then I lather on some water, and magically the oily texture (which makes your face glistering in the mirror) then turns to a soapy consistency, and then I use the muslin cloth provided to pat my face (while the cloth is hot), and then use the cloth to gently rinse everything off and then splash some cold water on my face to close the pore! Viola, you feel a difference even after the first use (ok, you have to follow all the steps in the direction, no cheating!), my face felt really soft, smooth and tight (probably because of the cold water for this one).  I usually just use some very light balancing lotion (almost like a toner but with some nourishing effect, CDP is the one I currently use and LOVE) after I wash my face (I only use Evelom for the night time face cleaning), I think the product itself had some moisturizing effect by itself so I do not need the extra face creme for skin to stay hydrated. Coupled with a good night sleep, you gonna find a nice glow when you wake up next morning!</li>
    <li> Thee most amazing cleanser I have ever used. The results are stunning Ill never useanother ive spent so much money trying to find the right product this is amaze balls</li>
