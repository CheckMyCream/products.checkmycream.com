      <li>The attachments are easy to put onto the hair dryer and the size of the diffuser is perfect for maintaining curls or making waves.  </li>

      <li>Good dryer like the cord</li>
      <li>It dries my hair in a fair amount of time</li>

      <li>/&gt;Third of all this blow dryer has SO many settings!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the retractable cord!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister&#x27;s awhile ago!  </li>
      <li>The retractable cord is really nice.</li>
      <li>Still nice.</li>
      <li>The cord retracts nicely into the handle when finished.</li>
      <li>My wife really liked this product</li>
      <li>However, what I really liked was the retractable cord feature--</li>
      <li>This has a good amount of power and I love the cord keeper feature.</li>
      <li>The cord does kind of get caught every now and then, but</li>
      <li>It works well, dries my hair nicely, just as Conair dryers have always done for me.</li>
      <li>The Cool Shot is great for locking in curls, so it&#x27;s a must-have for me.</li>
      <li>The cord itself is very easy to take out and retract.</li>
      <li>(although I&#x27;m sure my stylist would have a BIT more to say on that topic)!</li>
      <li>it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power.</li>
      <li>The three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand.</li>
      <li>As you may already know, most women use one hand to hold the dryer, and one hand to hold a brush.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The air does not add static to the hair.</li>
      <li>Two things I love most about this dryer: The color and the retractable cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>A better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons</li>
      <li>I am so glad Conair is still making this model and that Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>I asked my hair dresser if the ceramic tourmaline thing was a big deal or just impressive advertising.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will loosen up a bit with use, however.    </li>
      <li>*, with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution.  </li>
      <li>Love retractable cord</li>
      <li>I love the 2 attachments.</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I love, love, LOVE this feature.</li>
      <li>i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>but I miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed.  </li>
      <li>So glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love about this hair dryer</li>
      <li>any case, this would make an excellent hair dryer for a guest bathroom or for the men folk who just need a quick, good dry.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer; the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it&#x27;s the most quiet hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
      <li>The cool shot button is handy to help set your style.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed at all!</li>
      <li>* Able to easily style while drying&lt;br</li>
      <li>hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish, or fine hair and are not in a rush.</li>
      <li>Like the flat one they use in hair salons that give you that perfect silky smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Not a bad dryer!</li>
      <li>Dries my wifes curly hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>The filter on the back is removable, and thus easy to clean - yet more insurance that the dryer will give you many years of great service.</li>
      <li>The attachments are easy to attach and remove.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It felt well balanced in the hand and was easy to hold and work with.</li>
      <li>I liked that it had a cool setting and didn&#x27;t have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  </li>
      <li>There is also a warm setting and hot, and two speeds.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is light, quiet, and best of all, the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button.</li>
      <li>It has all the heat and speed settings you could need for a blow out and the retractable cord is the best feature because it prevents a dreaded tangled mess.</li>
      <li>The cord keeper (retractable cord at the push of a button) works perfectly and keeps the tangled mess out of the way.  </li>
      <li>Some people may find that a huge plus, I don&#x27;t know, but I did notice that both the diffuser and the concentrator (which also comes with it) snap on the front and</li>
      <li>(and no longer appears to be available here).</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had to buy a new hairdryer because my adorable puppy chewed the cord in half on the Conair model I&#x27;d had for years. When I saw that this one with the retractable cord, it seemed to be the perfect solution. Now when I&#x27;m finished using it, I press the button and the cord retracts--so much nicer than wrapping the cord around it. It&#x27;s the little things, you know?! And the gorgeous color is just a bonus. It works well, dries my hair nicely, just as Conair dryers have always done for me. I have curly hair, but I don&#x27;t even need the diffuser because this one doesn&#x27;t blow my hair around like an open window. It&#x27;s hot and precise, and I love it. I&#x27;d even say it&#x27;s puppy proof, but I still keep it up high where the little fur-face can&#x27;t get to it, just in case.</li>
    <li> The power of the dryer seems less than I would have thought.  Still nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact hairdryer more than 5 years ago and I had to buy it again. It&#x27;s efficient and travels well!</li>
    <li> First the positive: this hairdryer is just the right weight, not so heavy that your arm gets tired during blow drying and not too light either. The color of the model I got is a sort of shimmering raspberry and is beautiful. The cord keeper feature is also pretty handy and so far, after using this dryer every day for almost a week works well. it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call it ultra powerful. I have another hairdryer at home which is a little more powerful. It dries my shoulder length hair, start to finish in around 10 minutes. This conair dryer is not hot enough or powerful enough to do that and has taken almost 20 minutes everyday to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish, or fine hair and are not in a rush. I will use it on weekends or evenings, but I don&#x27;t want to get up 10-15 minutes earlier in the morning to get my hair dried.</li>
    <li> Very nice features in this dryer. Spouses who sleep in will like how quiet it is, and it has a cool setting, as well as a cool shot button. The retractable cord is much preferable to having a pile of cord in the linen closet where it can knock over the bubble bath, etc.There is also a warm setting and hot, and two speeds. It&#x27;s called a \\&quot;styler\\&quot; rather than a dryer. The attachments are easy to attach and remove. It doesn&#x27;t have the strongest air flow, but very nice, anyway, especially if your hair is prone to getting flyaways from too much air blasting.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer - I have had one for many years and when it finally died I bought another. I was really happy to see this on Vine as it&#x27;s always good to have another dryer in the house.  The cord retracts easily, the dryer is powerful and cuts down on drying time. I have very thick and curly shoulder length hair and it only takes about 20 min max to dry.  Hi/Low power settings along with 3 temp settings and a cold shot button make this the unit for everyone. Not too heavy, either.</li>
    <li> Ionizes and retracts. It has great power.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t buy hair dryers often as I tend to use them till they die, but this one may be the exception. I have thin hair but this still takes a good 7-10 minutes to dry because the high setting feels like low was on my old crappy Conair cheapo one I had. Its pretty but not very strong motors and the cord doesn&#x27;t always want to go back in the handle. It is relatively lite though ad it gets the job done so I&#x27;ll keep it awhile, but once it starts getting weaker I&#x27;ll definitely pay more for a better hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Sent it back. Not powerful</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about this product.  My reasons for a 5-star rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;* Powerful and efficient - hair dries quickly without being blown wild&lt;br /&gt;* Able to easily style while drying&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with two attachments AND they stay in place wonderfully&lt;br /&gt;* Retractable cord eliminates hassles between uses&lt;br /&gt;* For a hair drying styler, this is not excessively loud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;* No complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister&#x27;s awhile ago!  I finally confirmed the type to purchase.  Then, I found it on Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Today&#x27;s Deals&amp;#34; (daily deals) - even better!  This is a fabulous hair drying styler at an extremely reasonable price (as listed or with a deal)!  Over my lifetime, I have used many hair dryers, with a wide price range, and had not ever been super pleased with any one in particular....before using this one.  I was so looking forward to getting it and was super excited to use it....I was not disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying the same dryer as my old one.  This one takes much longer to dry my hair and the cord is not as long.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after using my daughters. The Conair hair dryer dried my hair really fast. I would think this Conair hair dryer would be powerful enough for anyone.</li>
    <li> First if all, the cord is retractable. That alone makes my life 50% easier. Now I don&#x27;t have to do that weird thing where I wrap the cord around the handle or wherever I can which only causes it to tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all this comes with changeable heads. Like the flat one they use in hair salons that give you that perfect silky smooth finish. Now I can do this at home! I&#x27;m still working on managing how to reach the back of my head BUT IM GETTING THERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third of all this blow dryer has SO many settings! I&#x27;m a simple person. The only hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used was a Tokidoki one that had one setting and my moms that she NO JOKE got in the 80&#x27;s. she STILL has it. Like you could reach into the head and touch the coils guys. That hair dryer is so burned out that it only blasts cold air. No joke. I should get her a hair dryer for Christmas! I love how this dryer has several settings and there&#x27;s a cool blast option that is helpful and not a sign that your dryer is done for the decade.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this hair dryer creates massive tangles in long hair, even when used very carefully. Never had this problem with any of my previous blow dryers. It doesn&#x27;t put out very hot air and the attachments reduce the air flow too much, so hair doesn&#x27;t dry very well. The controls and retractable cord are nice, but not worth pulling my hair out trying to detangle. Might work for those with really short hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! The retractable cord is really nice. The air does not add static to the hair. I wish it came in other color options.</li>
    <li> It says it is 3 speed/2 heat temps. Unless we are now counting &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; as a speed, it only has 2 speeds, low and high. I have been looking for a 3 speed dryer and that was why I purchased this. Used it once and don&#x27;t care for it. On the positive side, I really like the color and the cord retractor is convenient.</li>
    <li> My wife really liked this product it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> This hair dryer performs exactly as expected and advertised.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has a good amount of power and I love the cord keeper feature.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. I have one like it myself and bought for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It is lightweight &amp; has 3 heat settings.  I love the 2 attachments.</li>
    <li> This Conair hair dryer works great. It runs smooth and quieter than my last hair dryer (an old Remington). The cord retracts nicely into the handle when finished. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I have ever owned! Loved the solid feel and design!</li>
    <li> Good dryer like the cord</li>
    <li> Anything to make my bathroom more organized because I destroy it with makeup, brushes, etc almost every time I get ready. I place it in a cabinet &amp;#34;hanger&amp;#34; and this cord keeper style is freakin&#x27; awesome when storing! The power on it is great also. I have extremely thick hair and it works for me. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Quiet and powerful, cord retracts well.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it, so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the GFCI plug I knew I had to purchase it again.  The retractable cord is just brilliant -- every hair dryer should have this feature.  The cool shot button is handy to help set your style.  And the diffuser attachment is just *fabulous*, with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution.  I am so glad Conair is still making this model and that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> Very good blow dryer . retractable , good quality and its not very noisy.</li>
    <li> Definitely reduced frizz. This hair dryer is heavier than my previous one, but it works great and dries fast!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light, quiet, and best of all, the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button. I love, love, LOVE this feature.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. My wife really loves it and all the accessories that come with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer.  It is my second one.  I had the first one for years and when it finally broke, I tried a few other blow dryers but returned them all and went right back to the Conair 1875.  The cord keeper is a great feature for me, since I keep the dyer in a drawer.  It stays in there compactly.</li>
    <li> Received exactly when promised. Product is exactly what I was looking for and met or exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> I used this blow dryer for 4 years until it randomly broke one day but it always gave my hair a silky, smooth, and shiny finish (I have straight hair). I would say the noise level is average, not too loud but not whisper quiet either. It has all the heat and speed settings you could need for a blow out and the retractable cord is the best feature because it prevents a dreaded tangled mess.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer; the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it&#x27;s the most quiet hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The only drawback for me is the placement of the on-off switch; it&#x27;s located at the very bottom of the handle so I have to use two hands to turn it on or off.  A better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons so it could be turned on/off easily with my thumb; currently, the speed/temperature button is easily reached with my thumb, but I don&#x27;t change that very often.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.  Nevertheless, I still highly recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Dried my long straight fine hair in a reasonable amount of time. Did a faster job than my old dryer. We&#x27;ve been using that one to roast green coffee beans, so I was needing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different temp settings were accurate and the cool shot button worked fine. Left my hair looking full with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt well balanced in the hand and was easy to hold and work with. Not too noisy, big plus. No weird plasticky smell on first use. Even bigger plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is genius!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new hair dryer I think this one is a very good value. Works great with all the features you need.</li>
    <li> Nice and does not fry hair!</li>
    <li> preforms as described--wife loves retractable cord and dryer performance</li>
    <li> It is quiet and works great. I like the cord keeper when traveling.</li>
    <li> It is heavy and somewhat cumbersome.  But it does have 3 heat setting, Hot,Medium, Cool.  For others like me with fine hair and/or scalp sensitivity the option to dial down the heat and even cool down are welcome features.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy.</li>
    <li> Cons: a bit heavy, not quite as powerful as I&#x27;d expect and the cord is short. My hair is frizzy from use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit disappointed given the great reviews by others.</li>
    <li> The retractable cord is easy to use and very convenient. If it doesn&#x27;t go back in all the way pull the cord out again and slowly glide it. Works like a charm every time. I have thick wavy hair and this dryer dries quickly and relatively quietly (for a hair dryer). It&#x27;s not overly heavy and the handle grip fits my hand perfectly. So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> So I bought this hairdryer like 3 years ago...and I&#x27;m buying it again! The cord does kind of get caught every now and then, but oh well! I&#x27;ve dropped this thing, packed it back and forth to college and trips...I&#x27;ve accidentally throw it before, but by a miracle it survived!! So like any amazing product...I will burry it and buy the same thing! Oh and my defuser do dad never caught on fire/melted....but I never left it on for a super long time...caution it does get hot!</li>
    <li> The Conair 1875-Watt Cord Keeper is, well, a keeper. After several years with heavy ceramic hair dryers with winding the cord after use, The Conair is a breath of fresh air. The cord itself is very easy to take out and retract. Making it pretty much usable with any plug in our bathroom vanity. When you turn it on, you notice how quiet it is compared to your past hair dryers. Comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning. How well does it work? Longer, thicker hair seems to dry much faster and with it&#x27;s lightweight use, it is much easier to sustain longer positions when drying thicker hair. The three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand. With the retractable cord, ease of use and the lightweight features of this, I can highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars. At 1875 watts, this really is just your average hairdryer. It comes with two attachments, one a diffuser for curly hair and one a flow director. Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but I had a very, very hard time getting the attachments on the hairdryer itself and broke two fingernails trying to get them on, ouch. The retractable cord is a boon, of course, and so is the cool button which stays on when pushed. There are low, medium, and high heat settings rather than just low and high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is just about average for the price point. It depends on what you want for *your* hair. If you have a short, easy to dry style, this may work perfect for you. If you have longer, easier to damage hair, you might want to research some higher-end hairdryers. Just like styling tools such as flat irons, there are lower end tools that damage hair easily but are more affordable and higher end tools that cost a lot more but the results show (and are much easier on your hair). Hair dryers are the same. If that might apply to you, you might - maybe - be better off saving your money here and putting it towards a higher end hair dryer that would dry your hair in half the time and be less damaging in the long run. Do some research on it, ask your stylist and find out what they use and advise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this would make an excellent hair dryer for a guest bathroom or for the men folk who just need a quick, good dry. No cord, no mess!</li>
    <li> Not a bad dryer! Yes, heavy, but sleek as can be and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
    <li> 3 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer has some great qualities and could easily have earned 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the most awkward button positions ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this hair dryer is that it has an incredibly quiet sound during use. The low setting, which is what I use all over my hair to help it dry before using a round brush, is so quiet, I can still hear my husband talking to me from the room over! This is a big positive. I also like that the cord is retractable and easy to store without getting tangled in with other cords from my flat iron or curling irons. My final positive and feature that I really like is that the nozzle where the air comes out of is quite narrow and concentrates on the area I want to dry without blowing the rest of my hair all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for what made this dryer lose 1.5 stars: the buttons. This hair dryer uses two &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; buttons. One for &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;  levels and one for &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; levels. 1. I wish these buttons were reversed. I use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; levels every time I dry my hair and these buttons are located on the most bottom part of the handle. This means that it is almost impossible to slide the button on to dry my hair without using two hands. As you may already know, most women use one hand to hold the dryer, and one hand to hold a brush. This is a hard task with this dryer. I know that this is also a new dryer but I find the slider buttons to be extremely hard to slide up and down. I am hoping with use they become less stiff.  2. I wish the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button was in the middle of the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; options. It adds an extra step when I go from &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; to turning it off. The dryer has to go through the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting first and when you&#x27;re fumbling with the buttons already, it makes this seem like an unnecessary extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I enjoy the sound and weight of this hair dryer as well as its drying capabilities. The major cons are that the buttons most used are located in a very awkward position that makes drying my hair more laborsome than it should be.he sound and weight of this hair dryer as well as its drying capabilities.

    <li> When wife is happy with purchase, husband is happy with purchase</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite dryer. I love the built in cord retractor, especially for traveling, which we do often. I have so many gadgets I need to bring, my suitcase is always a mess of cords. In addition to that, it dries my hair SO fast. I have fairly thick hair, though it&#x27;s thinned over the years a bit, and it would take me in upwards of 20 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time. The cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you&#x27;re in a hurry, too! My hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries, so I really like the diffuser attachment as well. It works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy. I still like to follow up with my straightener because it makes my hair really shine and glow, but the diffuser makes the job much easier. I&#x27;ve been using tourmaline ceramic dryers for years and I have MUCH less breakage and a huge reduction in split ends since making the switch, so at this price, this dryer/styler is a must have!</li>
    <li> Great for the price!! Glad I didn&#x27;t spend hundreds like I&#x27;ve seen on others!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a really great blow dryer. I bought it to replace another one that died.  It has lots of power and works great!!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I love the color and it dry my hair so quick!!</li>
    <li> Size is a little large but it works really well love the retractable cord.</li>
    <li> Two things I love most about this dryer: The color and the retractable cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good points: It is very quiet, but in my brain, because it is quiet it isn&#x27;t doing as good of a job. My daughter would run from the sound of the previous dryer. This one she tolerates enough to allow me to dry her bangs before she runs away. The amount of air is much less than my previous dryer, but my old dryer was, well, old. There is no medium speed, it is high or low. There are three temp settings, plus the cool shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed a difference in dry time for my hair. But my hair is VERY thick and usually doesn&#x27;t dry for four to five hours (underneath) if I towel dry and go. My hair is only chin length, so that is a lot of drying time. With this dryer, to get my hair almost dry, (approx 85%,) it takes 10-15 minutes, not much difference than my old dryer. But, I can tell this one isn&#x27;t frying my hair. I asked my hair dresser if the ceramic tourmaline thing was a big deal or just impressive advertising. She said it provides a very big difference in dry time and keeping healthy hair. No false advertising in her opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I like it, I gave it four stars because the drying time is the same. Other than that, this is a pretty great dryer!</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my long-haired daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have had the non -cord keeper version of this and the cord storage really improves it.  This is a good basic dryer . My previous one lasted 3 years with almost daily use which I feel is a good result for the price.</li>
    <li> Ok so i have thick coarse hair and i was looking for something that can tame this head of mine. First let me start by saying I do like the retractable cord. Must have now. I like that five settings this offers, (hot,warm, cool, low, and high) i do wish there was a medium  but its not bad. My only thing is i can not use either of the attachments and i know that because of my hair, however there is always at least one attachment i can use, not this time. It gives you recommendations based on your hair what settings to use. Overall its not a bad dryer. Has many nice features just wish it came with more or different or even other attachment options.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  The cord keeper (retractable cord at the push of a button) works perfectly and keeps the tangled mess out of the way.  The attachments are easy to put onto the hair dryer and the size of the diffuser is perfect for maintaining curls or making waves.  There are 3 different heat settings - cool, warm, hot, and 2 different speeds.  There is also a cool blast button, but I absolutely love that there is a cool heat setting as well.  I used the cool blast button on my previous hair dryer all the time, and it hurt my hand to keep holding it down, because there was no cool heat setting.  Problem solved with this Conair model!  Now when I&#x27;m trying to set my curls with cool air, it&#x27;s so much easier!</li>
    <li> At the beginning of the year I reviewed another Conair blow dryer here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3FC82PIHNUT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00GLS519U  As noted in that review we were pleasantly at how good that hairdryer was, but my wife didn&#x27;t like the placement of the buttons.  When I saw this model that had a different style of buttons and in a different place, I thought she may like it more.  However, what I really liked was the retractable cord feature--too many a hair dryer has met its demise from the everyday wrapping of the cord around the body.  I figured this would eliminate the problem (time will tell, and I intend to post back later with updates).    I don&#x27;t dry my hair with a dryer--there is no need since it is so short.  My wife, however does on a daily basis.  It is important to me that she not have to hold a whirring jet engine right next to her ears each day, so for me, a quiet hair dryer is the only kind worth considering.  This dryer is extremely quiet, so I&#x27;m happy there.  In fact, it may be the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Note, however, that the fan doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as the other dryers.  She has shorter hair, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal to her, but I suspect there will be many who disagree.  I&#x27;ve taken 1/2 a star off for lack of power.  Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t do 1/2 a star, so I had to round my rating down to 4 stars.    Unlike the other Conair I reviewed, this model comes with a diffuser.  Some people may find that a huge plus, I don&#x27;t know, but I did notice that both the diffuser and the concentrator (which also comes with it) snap on the front and they are just a little bit difficult to pop on and off--I felt like I was going to break it.  I&#x27;m sure they will loosen up a bit with use, however.    Like all the hair dryers I&#x27;ve seen recently (but unlike any from yester-year), this model has a removable filter so that when (not if) it fills up with junk, you can easily take it off and clean it to keep the blower goin&#x27; full throttle.    As my wife and daughters use the dryer more, I&#x27;ll update with anything of note that they find, but for now, everyone is perfectly happy with the dryer... and I even like the color.    Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, about 4 inches past my shoulders, and my hair stylist says it&#x27;s very fine hair but I have a lot of it. I love this hair dryer. Not only is it a pretty purple/magenta color, but with this dryer I can dry my whole head in five minutes. There are three temperature settings, cool, warm and hot, and two speeds, low and high. The cord retracts as advertised. When I use this I find I don&#x27;t have as much frizz as I do if I air dry. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was a good replacement unit for the one my wife wore out.</li>
    <li> The puppies love it after their daily refresher cleanup.</li>
    <li> I picked this up on lightening deal as I needed a new blow dryer. It&#x27;s as good as my last conair but a bit less powerful - which is fine for me because I couldn&#x27;t use the highest setting on my last one since it blew my hair to much - I have fine hair so it just tangled my hair on the highest setting. I love the retractable cord!</li>
    <li> It what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer works well although not as powerful as the Revlon one I am replacing this with.  It dries my hair in a fair amount of time but I miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed.  The curved handle on this does not allow you to do this.  Other than that I like it and I like the retractable cord although the cord could be a tad longer.</li>
    <li> Love retractable cord</li>
    <li> i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  Much easier to store.  My old Conair cord keeper (less expensive, 2 speed, 2 heat settings) wore out at the plug.  Couldn&#x27;t be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty Amazon.  I saw this model and read the reviews.  I liked that it had a cool setting and didn&#x27;t have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  I also like that it has the cord keeper.  But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.  If a quieter blow dryer is what you&#x27;re looking for, with 1875 power, this is your dryer.  Worth the extra money!!!  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  Super fast delivery!  Ps, use the concentrator nozzle, cuts down on frizz.</li>
    <li> You might say \\&quot;a hairdryer is just a hairdryer\\&quot;, and that would be pretty accurate for the average customer (although I&#x27;m sure my stylist would have a BIT more to say on that topic)! ;) But, for me, it&#x27;s the little things that take a reliable, quality hairdryer a bit further, putting it at the front of the pack. The features and functionality with this dryer help to move it to the top of the list for the dryers I currently have at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this Conair 1875 Cord Keeper to replace a reliable, still functional Conair Ionic Pro dryer that I got 4 years ago (and no longer appears to be available here). That dryer is still working great for me a few years after first getting it, but I have to admit that, as with most hair appliances, that cord just bugs me every time I use it! I guess, really, if that&#x27;s the only qualm I have with it, it&#x27;s doing a bang-up job, but the little plastic tab that is used to keep the cord in place after wrapping is always just a pain to deal with. Thankfully, with the cord keeper feature of this dryer, that&#x27;s no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the functionality of my previous dryer is still here with this one. The rocker buttons on it allow you to select hot (for if you either have really thick, coarse hair - or are just a masochist, and decide to concentrate the heat via a soft bonnet curler dryer attachment, like I use  ;)  ), warm - the setting that I prefer with my mass quantities of fine hair rolled on curlers and tucked under said bonnet, or cool - which I often use to finish out my 45 minute hair drying sessions. The Cool Shot feature is also another great one for a blast of extra cool air (kind of amazing to me, considering the hot air my dryer&#x27;s just been blowing out, followed by the A/C cold air that this button activates). The Cool Shot is great for locking in curls, so it&#x27;s a must-have for me. The filter on the back is removable, and thus easy to clean - yet more insurance that the dryer will give you many years of great service. Add to that the fact that now you don&#x27;t have to FIGHT with yet another cord after your styling session is over, and the great condition that my hair comes out when I&#x27;m done using this dryer, and there&#x27;s my reasoning for moving this dryer to the top of my list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord rewind on mine isn&#x27;t quite as strong or great as that on my typical cord rewind vacuum (my hair dryer pulls almost the entire cord up, but leaves just a little less than about a foot hanging out). It&#x27;s easy enough, though, to just gently push the remainder of the cord into the channel, and push the cord rewind button again for the dryer to retract the remainder of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG story short (sorry - I have a tendency to do that! ;)), Conair has put out yet another quality dryer here, with that last remaining convenience that I&#x27;m sure will find these in many a household to come! Pair that with the gorgeous, sparkly, ruby red nailpolish color it comes in, and it&#x27;s pretty and sleek enough looking to happily hang it on display in your bathroom! Love it! 4 1/2 stars!s of great service.

    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t really sound like a normal hair dryer, it sounds more like a vacuum.</li>
    <li> A very good value for the money.  The on/off switch is a little hard for arthritic hands to use, but not a deal breaker.  Dries my wifes curly hair very quickly.</li>
