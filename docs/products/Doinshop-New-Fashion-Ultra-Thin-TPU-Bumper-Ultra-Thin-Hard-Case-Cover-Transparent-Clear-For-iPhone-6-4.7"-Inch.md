<li> This thing is so flimsy if you give it a mean look</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap! I have been through two and they both broke! Once you try to put the case over your phone the edges start to peel off! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this phone case for about 2 weeks now and I love it. Got it in the blue color, really nice. It actually glows in the dark, which is kinda cool. The only bad thing is that shipping took forever, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. It fits perfectly and its very light weight and it was suprised tk find out the case is actually glow in the dark!</li>
    <li> Really cute and thin case. But not much of a lip to protect screen</li>

    <li> Came quick and was what i expected!</li>
    <li> Waited a month to receive this and finally got it....it&#x27;s absolute crap. This thing is so flimsy if you give it a mean look it breaks. It&#x27;s so cheaply made that the &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; bumper is barely hanging on to the &amp;#34;plastic back&amp;#34; and this thing doesn&#x27;t even fit my iPhone 6. I requested a refund since I can&#x27;t use this and they respond with &amp;#34;well your responsible for shipping which is expensive so we can send you a new one or you pay for shipping&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t want another cheap flimsy case that doesn&#x27;t fit and have to wait another month to get it! Guess I&#x27;m out $10 after shipping. Buyers beware! Not worth you time.</li>
    <li> Nice case, but broke in the sides after a week.</li>
    <li> Cute but broke when I took it out of the package</li>
    <li> really slim case and I got so many compliments on it! the part that covers my lock button broke though but it&#x27;s still on the case. it&#x27;s a good case and fits nice!!</li>
    <li> Received the case &amp; it was broken on the bottom left hand corner near the speaker. Cute case, but was disappointed ..</li>
    <li> love how it glows in the dark. not much of a number to protect it though.</li>

    <li> Great product ! It just takes so long .....</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this case in my hand , it fits great and doesn&#x27;t add any bulk to my phone, power button and volume controls are easy to use ,you don&#x27;t have to push to hard for access , I&#x27;m very careful with my phone and really don&#x27;t care for other bulky more protective cases. This case is purely for looks with minimal protection</li>
    <li> I ordered this case on April 11th,said it wouldn&#x27;t be here until June 1st. I just got it today May 4th, so I&#x27;m pretty satisfied! It wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting but the case is pretty cute for it being so cheap.</li>
    <li> Great case for the money. Glows in the dark and when your flash is on the blue on the edges lights up.</li>
    <li> The case took about a month to get here and  he it did it left my screen exposed no protection at all</li>
    <li> I want my money back. The case was for a six plus not a six</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all ! It&#x27;s not hard , but a soft plastic. And when I put it on I could see bubbles on the back but I guess that is what I get for the low price .</li>
