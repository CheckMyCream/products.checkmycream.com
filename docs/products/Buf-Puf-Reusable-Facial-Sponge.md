      <li>this has worked the best.</li>
      <li>Work great!</li>
      <li>My skin looks great!</li>
      <li>Great for blackheads problem.</li>
      <li>Great exfoliator.</li>
      <li>Still the best for smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>The most efficient exfoliation sponge there is!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>wonderful to feel that strong clean feeling when using the puff.</li>
      <li>Love them and my face feels great and clean!</li>
      <li>&#x3D;) I like them better than loofahs-they seem to stay mildew free and are great on knees, elbows and heels.</li>
      <li>my pores are shrinking and the clogged pores seem to be getting better.</li>
      <li>It is better than any blemish control scrub on the market and leaves no grainy residue..</li>
      <li>okay, I like the way they feel on my face.</li>
      <li>I have tried many things to exfoliate ..</li>
      <li>Great to clean your face and feel like new!</li>
      <li>Using it for a while and my face feels more clean and shines then ever before.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m worth it!</li>
      <li>My face feels and is super smooth and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>To my excited surprised I see one model using a Buf Puf.</li>
      <li>But i&#x27;m certainly going to use these while I have them.</li>
      <li>They are very abrasive so be gentle.</li>
      <li>And this 2-pack is very well priced.</li>
      <li>This has really helped my skin by exfoliating every day ..</li>
      <li>The other day I was watching a program(Mirror, Mirror) where they featured top models and their beauty regimen.</li>
      <li>The puff seems to last for a long time and I&#x27;m thrilled to have something to wash my face with that doesn&#x27;t stink after just one use.  </li>
      <li>The sponge is amazing to take out all the dead skin!</li>
      <li>Used these in high school and thought they were not made anymore.  </li>
      <li>What keeps me from a better review is the Buf-Puf&#x27;s texture which, though not overly harsh, still makes me feel as if I&#x27;m washing my face with fiberglass.</li>
      <li>i love how they get rid of my black heads!</li>
      <li>My initial concern was that these may not be hygienic to reuse, but I found that they&#x27;re actually quite easy to wash and dry quickly which is a nice change from the waste that comes from regular disposable face-cloths.</li>
      <li>They work really well to remove dead skin, and they make your skin feel really, really smooth.</li>
      <li>I love these little things and would be lost without them!</li>
      <li>Glad to receive this hard to find product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using 3M Buf-Pufs for nearly 30 years.</li>
      <li>For me, my skin, especially on my face, always feels extra soft and smooth after a Buf-Puf wash-and at nearly sixty, half of that in sunny Florida, that&#x27;s high praise.</li>
      <li>Rough at first, but after use get softer.  </li>
      <li>4 stars because it is a little more rough than I would like</li>
      <li>They dry out fast.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say I am thrilled and recommend them to anyone even with sensitive skin like i have.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty rough, so next time I&#x27;d opt for the &amp;#34;gentle version&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I personally would recommend against using these for the purpose of daily exfoliation (although I do have particularly sensitive skin)</li>

<li> I could feel those dead skin cells sloughing off and after only one use my skin felt cleaner than after  any clay.mask I have removed.</li>
<li> After a few weeks, they compact down, but you can pull them apart and fluff them up to make them last a bit longer.</li>
<li> I ran to Google and found them being sold on Amazon and some other retail stores.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a really firm scrub, but the cleaning and exfoliating are unbeatable.</li>
<li> Little expensive though,</li>
<li> I call these sponges the poor man&#x27;s microdermabrasion.</li>
<li> Amazon was the least expensive and I purchased 6.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>

    <li> these rock! i love how they get rid of my black heads!</li>
    <li> These pads work okay, I like the way they feel on my face. However, I have yet to notice an improvement with my complexion.</li>
    <li> I remember these from my teen age years, marriage, raising my children and then they disappeared. The other day I was watching a program(Mirror, Mirror) where they featured top models and their beauty regimen. To my excited surprised I see one model using a Buf Puf. I ran to Google and found them being sold on Amazon and some other retail stores. Amazon was the least expensive and I purchased 6.&lt;br /&gt;How wonderful to feel that strong clean feeling when using the puff.

    <li> Repeat buy. I love these little things and would be lost without them! I exfoliate once a week and these are great to have!</li>
    <li> Just like I remember. They are very abrasive so be gentle.</li>

    <li> Glad to receive this hard to find product. Nothing else does the same job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using regular Buf-Pufs for 26 years. My skin looks great! Everybody comments on it -- both men and women. It&#x27;s a really firm scrub, but the cleaning and exfoliating are unbeatable. And this 2-pack is very well priced.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years! Love them and my face feels great and clean!</li>
