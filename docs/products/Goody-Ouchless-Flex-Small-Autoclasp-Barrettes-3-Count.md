      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>Granted, not too many barrettes work optimally for me, but this one takes a dive in functionality.  </li>
      <li>Love it, I have a bunch of them.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>

      <li>I used to be able to buy these awesome barrettes way back in the day).  </li>
      <li>These barretts work great, stay where you put them and really hold, and dosn&#x27;t hurt your hair.</li>
      <li>:):)  wish they made some even ssmaller size.</li>
      <li>So I was pleased when Goody came out with these.  </li>
      <li>They are perfect for making buns if you have long hair.</li>
      <li>And without all that metal in most barrettes, I can even comfortably wear it when I sleep.  </li>
      <li>They are the most comfortable clip I have found.  </li>
      <li>I totally love this clip comfortable to wear with out snapping or pulling my hair strands out.</li>
      <li>Easy to close.</li>
      <li>--they fall apart so easily.  </li>
      <li>so I can easily put my hair in a twist and have it stay up.</li>
      <li>I have fine but curly hair, and cannot use a lot of product without making my curls droop and flatten.  </li>
      <li>Great for long hair that most clips will not close around, or else break.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy, no pinching, goes up in a second, and always looks great.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pain free.</li>
      <li>Use them all the time -- comfortable.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, these are another cheap product made in China.  </li>
      <li>They also work great for a low pony tail and for getting hair out of the way in the kitchen or for face washing.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll need to secure it with a pony tail holder and then clip it up if you want to do that,</li>
      <li>Comfortable, but falls out of my hair (medium weight, curly),</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull out hair and securely holds in place.</li>
      <li>and I need to have my hair secure when working in the hospital.</li>
      <li>This barrette is made of relatively cheap plastic, and looks really cheap too.  </li>
      <li>How good could a completely plastic barrette be?  </li>
      <li>They are easy to use for a quick up do.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use</li>
      <li>First, they are flexible and durable, much more so than metal barrettes in my experience.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like it when I first received it.  </li>
      <li>This works great for thick hair, and I love that it&#x27;s so light.</li>
      <li>Mostly I wear it at night to keep my hair from tangling up too much.  </li>
      <li>Even though my hair is super straight and super fine, this clip holds my hair in place- ALL DAY.</li>
      <li>I really think this would be best for thick hair.</li>
      <li>The spot where the crosspiece slips under the oval part is beginning to wear, but it still works and is definitely worth the cost.</li>
      <li>These are worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>it worth it</li>
      <li>Perfect for natural/Afro textured/curly hair, or if you just have really thick straight hair, maybe???</li>
      <li>I bought these for my naturally kinky/curly hair because of kim love of kimmaytube but at the moment I&#x27;ve been using it to keep my braid extensions off my face</li>
      <li>The Flat smooth latch part slides through my hair without catching or tangling and the tiny plastic teeth on the main clip hold it nicely in place without damaging my hair.</li>
      <li>Wanted to wear as pictured on the side (side swept bangs), but the girl pictured must have a bizarrely large head!</li>
      <li>This is the best hair clip ever, I have thick naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think It would hold all my hair, but the flexible clip works very well!</li>
      <li>I was able to pull my hair back (even without combing out) and it stayed with all the curls.</li>
      <li>In real life - nope!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering several more --- some for me and some for my long-haired family members.</li>
      <li>I first purchased these through Target</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Great for thick hair, doesn&#x27;t damage hair</li>
      <li>I have very heavy hair, but it is not thick and these barrettes work perfectly for holding it all in place and not slipping out....</li>
      <li>Happy to report this sucker works like a charm!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Make sure you have thick hair and it will work just fine for you.</li>
      <li>guess this is one of those hit or miss depending on how much hair you have.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Won&#x27;t hold all day but looks nice in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this because it is made from some type of rubber/plastic material.  It will not hold my thick hair for long.  Price was good, but if you have very thick hair, I would go with the traditional spring clip for a secure hold.</li>
    <li> love it. wear it everyday. bought two in case. and gave one as a present.</li>
    <li> Just what I need for my sensitive head of long hair. It&#x27;s a good design that holds well.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and these are so nice for days to throw your hair up in a ponytail. Probably wouldn&#x27;t work out for thinner hair</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a second one and found it on Amazon. I love it</li>
    <li> really holds a lot of hair.  durable.</li>
    <li> This is the dumbest hair accessory I&#x27;ve ever owned. I read the other reviews and thought it was worth a try. Let me tell you, I wasted my money. It&#x27;s cheap stupid plastic and doesn&#x27;t grip my hair at all. I have medium length strait hair and it won&#x27;t do anything with my hair, won&#x27;t even clip it up. Seriously- Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> This barrette is made of relatively cheap plastic, and looks really cheap too.  I was hoping for something functional, but that looks a little unique compared to a typical ponytail binder.  It also slides out.  I have mid length thick hair, but it&#x27;s also silky, so I was hoping that the &amp;#34;flex grip&amp;#34; feature of this product would hold well, but it doesn&#x27;t for my hair type.</li>
    <li> If you have thick or long hair, this simply isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold your hair. My mom has thin hair, and I have it to her. It seemed to work alright for her.</li>
    <li> I love this barrettes, I wear them all the time and it&#x27;s pain free. The only down side is that sometimes after I attached my hair, the barrette comes right of and would not hold my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this barrette. I didn&#x27;t think It would hold all my hair, but the flexible clip works very well!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clip ever, I have thick naturally curly hair and it holds it all up no problem!</li>
    <li> No pinching, pulling or tearing of my hair.  Love them.  Glad I know where to get them now.  Pleasantly surprised</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s comfy and does seem to hold my hair pretty well. I took off one star for durability. The flexible part that the bar hooks under has already pulled away from the edges a bit. That piece is molded as a single rubbery layer that lines the entire back. So, maybe it won&#x27;t rip completely. The rubber also provides a bit of &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to keep it from sliding. My hair is shoulder length and I do a loose french twist with this barrette.</li>
    <li> I totally love this clip comfortable to wear with out snapping or pulling my hair strands out.So I would say it meets the rave that everyone has been giving it. It&#x27;s wort purchasing &amp; it worth it</li>
    <li> Very comfortable on my natural black hair ponytail, no snagging.</li>
    <li> Perfect for natural/Afro textured/curly hair, or if you just have really thick straight hair, maybe??? It work wonders for my hair and I have 3c/4a type curls.  It gives you a nice relaxed ponytail, without all the pulling.</li>
    <li> This clip is made of thin, flexible plastic.  Based on previous reviews, I thought it would do a better job of holding up my fine, thick, wavy, mid-back hair, but even using two of these isn&#x27;t enough to hold up my hair.  They&#x27;re nice quality, but my fine hair slips out, so I think that they&#x27;re better designed for those with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like it when I first received it.  How good could a completely plastic barrette be?  As it turns out, very very good indeed.  I find that if I twist my hair and insert the barrette, it will hold all day.  And without all that metal in most barrettes, I can even comfortably wear it when I sleep.  I&#x27;m ordering several more --- some for me and some for my long-haired family members.</li>
    <li> Apparently this is one of those Goody hair doohickeys that work for a few people with just the right kind of hair.  Mine is long, sleek, and midweight.  Granted, not too many barrettes work optimally for me, but this one takes a dive in functionality.  I put it in my hair, and a couple of minutes later it falls out.  It hangs on a little longer if I twist my hair up, but not long enough to consider it dependable.  Mostly I wear it at night to keep my hair from tangling up too much.  At least it&#x27;s not as uncomfortable as metal barrettes.</li>
    <li> Great for long hair that most clips will not close around, or else break.</li>
    <li> Favorite clip for thick/long  hair, hard to find.</li>
    <li> Best hair clip! Holds a twist of hair that&#x27;s thick and down to my elbows. And Amazon is the only place I could find them!</li>
    <li> I can wear this during yoga and lie on my back without a torturous metal device digging into my scalp. The spot where the crosspiece slips under the oval part is beginning to wear, but it still works and is definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected.  Too small to be of use in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great for my long thick Afro textured hair. Doesn&#x27;t pull out hair and securely holds in place.</li>
    <li> I already had one these and really liked it. So I ordered this one and it is twice the size of the one I have. I am not really happy with this one because it is so big.</li>
    <li> Great for thick hair, doesn&#x27;t damage hair</li>
    <li> I love these clips.  They are the most comfortable clip I have found.  At the end of the day when I just want to get my long hair up off my neck, I twist it up and clip it near the top of my head, kind of like a messy bun.  These clips lay flat against the head so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to lean back against it, I&#x27;ve even slept with my hair up in one of these.  I can&#x27;t find them in any stores anymore, so I am stocking up from Amazon before they got away for good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with barrettes, even as a new born baby (hairy baby) because they just don&#x27;t make them to accommodate thick hair.  For most of my grown life I&#x27;ve used those leather ones with a stick you push through your hair since they do stretch a bit and you can sometimes get the leatherworker to make you an extra large one.  But the stick will come out if you sleep in them, and they don&#x27;t do well when wet.  So I was pleased when Goody came out with these.  Sure, they still aren&#x27;t large enough to accommodate my dry hair wound around in a semi-bun--just way too much hair for them.  And I no longer wear ponytails.  I use them to hold my hair when I shower, and I use them to keep my hair twisted around on my head as the purple shampoo (for white hair) gets it&#x27;s 2-3 mins of saturation time on my hair.  Since there is no metal involved, there&#x27;s nothing to rust.  HOWEVER, these are another cheap product made in China.  The circular teeth piece comes unglued within about a month or sooner so I&#x27;ve had to glue every single one of these I&#x27;ve owned (maybe 12 so far).  The back &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; part rips.  The part that &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34; rips or tears so it starts catching on your hair.  Once the thing starts tearing, I toss it out because I can&#x27;t do fix it so it&#x27;s useless.  It&#x27;s just so sad.  But I&#x27;ve had trouble with all the metal ones too--they fall apart so easily.  So do the other all plastic barrettes.  Like I said, they don&#x27;t make barrettes anymore for thick luscious hair anymore (they used to, I used to be able to buy these awesome barrettes way back in the day).  And now you know why not so many females are growing their hair long, long, long anymore.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Hair-friendly.  Use as clip on dry hair or to separate and secure hair during my wash routine.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic but it will work until it breaks.</li>
    <li> This barrette can hold lots of hair.  May be use for buns &amp; ponytail.  Does not pull hair.  Easy to close.</li>
    <li> love this barrette.  came in the mail yesterday and I have been wearing it ever since.  all my hair fits in it and it stays up.  plus it is truly ouchless.  need to order more, just wish they came in different colors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently in nursing school and I need to have my hair secure when working in the hospital. I bought this so I can easily put my hair in a twist and have it stay up. I would say I have normal thickness and it does loosen up after awhile. I really think this would be best for thick hair. I also wish it came with some hairstyle ideas. I think goody discontinued this clip so I couldn&#x27;t find suggestions on their website either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Make sure you have thick hair and it will work just fine for you.</li>
    <li> I have very thick straight hair that generally refuses to stay in place. This clip works wonderfully to hold my hair in an updo. The Flat smooth latch part slides through my hair without catching or tangling and the tiny plastic teeth on the main clip hold it nicely in place without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> The best hair clip EVER. This clip is practically indestructible. It holds my hair up when it is twisted up and folded over (so- twice or three times- though I have medium long fine hair). I love that it doesn&#x27;t create this massive lump on the back of my head like a pony tail or other hard plastic clips (think about those head rests in your car while you&#x27;re driving- or when you&#x27;re trying to relax with your head against ANYTHING). Even though my hair is super straight and super fine, this clip holds my hair in place- ALL DAY. If I tie it up when my hair is wet, I can do aerobics or go running and it will stay. Clipping it when dry, it will stay all day- but not during a lot of jumping or bouncing- you&#x27;ll need to secure it with a pony tail holder and then clip it up if you want to do that,</li>
    <li> perfect for holding up a messy bun w/o irritating your scalp</li>
    <li> These barrettes are just what I&#x27;d hoped for!  I have very long, thick, fine hair and I can braid it, and use one of these to clip it up.  Perfect!  They also work great for a low pony tail and for getting hair out of the way in the kitchen or for face washing.  They don&#x27;t pull like a claw clip or a regular barrette, and their flexibility makes them very forgiving of less and more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the two-pack and received one black and one brown barrette.  Count me very pleased!</li>
    <li> These barrettes don&#x27;t stick to your hair!</li>
    <li> Photo shows black, but you might receive any color.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!  Exactly what I wanted.  I have thick hair and need a barrette to hold without POPPING OFF and/or pulling the hairs out.  I was able to pull my hair back (even without combing out) and it stayed with all the curls.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love it but it&#x27;s not terrible.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  Maybe my hair is too thick.</li>
    <li> I love these but cannot find them in the store.  They work well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product!  The size of the barrettes are perfect for women with a lot of hair like myself.  I have very thick natural hair and these barrettes hold my hair secure without feeling like it is pulling or damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these in stores around me anymore. They are perfect for making buns if you have long hair. They also don&#x27;t leave rubber band creases when you take it down.</li>
    <li> I first purchased these through Target and I must say that these are the the best barrettes/hair clips I have ever purchased. First, they are flexible and durable, much more so than metal barrettes in my experience. Second, they work super well for thick curly hair. Third, they have a classy look to them once they are in your hair. I will continue to purchase these as needed (i.e. if I lose the current ones).</li>
    <li> As someone with thick, curly hair, this is basically the only type of hair clip that I can use in my hair (by the way I am using my husband&#x27;s Amazon account)</li>
    <li> With two of these clips, I can twist up my long thick hair and hold it up with out pullling. Much better than contemporary clips which feel too tight and heavy for me.</li>
    <li> It works good.Best clip I&#x27;ve had. However, it was not black like the photo.It would be nice if the color was listed.</li>
    <li> Use them all the time -- comfortable.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and didn&#x27;t hold my hair.  I have fine thin hair.  I kept having to re-secure the clip because my hair kept falling out.  I was also disappointed by the flimsy plastic this is made of.  I think I will stick with metal clips.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t attempt to do intricate updos but this barrette holds all of my hair up in the shower without pulling or snagging.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this hair solution especially if you have thick hair love it</li>
    <li> Comfortable, but falls out of my hair (medium weight, curly), guess this is one of those hit or miss depending on how much hair you have.</li>
    <li> I had read a review that stated that it worked on fine thin hair.  It DOES NOT!  It slides right out of my hair and is made of a soft flexible plastic that isn&#x27;t stiff enough to hold anything.  In the photo it looks like it would be a hard plastic.  I threw is away is was useless.</li>
    <li> my full pony loses much less hair and my scalp is under much less pressure w/this!</li>
    <li> I ordered black and received brown.  Love the barrette but need the color shown on image.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this product works and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Ever since I first discovered these Ouchless Updo Barrettes a few years ago, my life has changed, no joke.  I have fine but curly hair, and cannot use a lot of product without making my curls droop and flatten.  But this barrette makes it so easy for a simple updo without added bobby pins or too much product other than some light cocoa butter.  It&#x27;s so easy, no pinching, goes up in a second, and always looks great.</li>
    <li> This clip is awesome. I bought these for my naturally kinky/curly hair because of kim love of kimmaytube but at the moment I&#x27;ve been using it to keep my braid extensions off my face and it holds the thick twists back. I can only imagine how they would hold by natural hair when these are taken down.</li>
    <li> Love it, I have a bunch of them. They are easy to use for a quick up do.</li>
    <li> Perfect for tying your hair back into a cute style when on the go!</li>
    <li> Much larger than expected! Wanted to wear as pictured on the side (side swept bangs), but the girl pictured must have a bizarrely large head! It looks perfectly sized for that there. In real life - nope!</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products!!!</li>
    <li> These barretts work great, stay where you put them and really hold, and dosn&#x27;t hurt your hair.:):)  wish they made some even ssmaller size.</li>
    <li> Out of the bag I wasn&#x27;t so sure this would fit (I have veeery thick hair). Happy to report this sucker works like a charm! Holds my hair and if it slips, which it does since my hair is heavy, it&#x27;s easy to pop off and replace with little fuss. Great for rolling my hair up off my neck during the summertime. Will be buying another in the future.</li>
    <li> These are hands-down my favorite hair clips.  They hold all of my thick hair in a twist for an entire day without inducing any nasty headaches.  (For comparison sake, my hair is about 4&amp;#34; longer than shoulder length.)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these because the design makes them flimsy, and they fall out of your hair.  Don&#x27;t buy unless you have very thick or curly hair.</li>
    <li> This works great for thick hair, and I love that it&#x27;s so light. Other barrettes that are big enough also tend to be heavy enough that they work against keeping my hair UP. It&#x27;s very comfortable - doesn&#x27;t pull, is very thin and 100% flexible.</li>
    <li> These barrettes are the best!!! I know own about 10. I bought enough to have them stashed in my vehicle, my husbands vehicle and several rooms in the house, I am NEVER without!!!!  I have very heavy hair, but it is not thick and these barrettes work perfectly for holding it all in place and not slipping out....</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and you can lay down and it doesn&#x27;t dig into your head.</li>
    <li> These are worth every penny.  The only ouch-less hair binder I have ever found.  I won&#x27;t admit I hoard them, but I may be old and bald before I run out.  ;)</li>
    <li> Very good hair clip.  I have soft, fine, curly hair and my daughter has coarse, thick, curly hair, but we both can use these barrettes and achieve long-lasting and COMFORTABLE hair styles.  We can wear them all day with no pulling, plus you can lean back against them with no pain or lumpy sensations.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair up w/o slipping</li>
