      <li>I have ALWAYS used this product and love it!  </li>

      <li>Product is hard to find as discontinued so very happy to be able to find it!!</li>
      <li>Although I was very happy with the service and the speed in which this product arrived from overseas, it was not exactly what I had been using for many years and that I used to be able to get here in the U.S.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that Max Factor is still available through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Great concealer that matches my skin color better than anything I&#x27;ve tried locally.  </li>

      <li>I was lucky to find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the old type, not as creamy and in different packaging.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t put on any makeup without using this cover up first to conceal any blemish or discoloration on my face.</li>

      <li>The company should spend a little more money and make a stronger case.</li>
      <li>When I was a lot younger and my lips sometimes peeled, this product would loosen the dead skin on my lips and I could easily peel it right off.  </li>
      <li>it is not the old ERACE!</li>
      <li>I have been buying Max Factor since I was in college in the early 60&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The older product was larger.</li>

<li> The coverage is average for a stick concealer which I use mostly for dark eye circles.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.</li>
<li> This product has a fragrance that i am sensitive to and it twists down when trying to apply.</li>
<li> I now need it to cover my old age dark circles!</li>
<li> I am a long, long, time Max Factor Fan.  </li>
<li> I finally found them on Amazon and ordered a few in different shades.</li>
<li> The other is sold on here, a little more expensive however</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the colors are very different from the past and Max Factor has added a strong perfume scent to the product...  </li>
<li> The tube itself is a dark blue rather than the black with the clear cover that I am used to, and there is a slight fragrance that I have not had in the past.  </li>
<li> so now i am returning the other 3</li>
<li> The other one, glides on nicer, doesn&#x27;t twist down and has no fragrance.</li>
<li> I bought this for dark under eye circles.</li>
<li> I also use a lighter shade of this to put just on the dark area of undereye circles after I apply my foundation and before applying my finishing powder.  </li>
<li> It is also a slightly lighter color.  </li>
<li> It seems slightly greasy.</li>
<li> I use the Medium on my lips first as a base for my lipstick so that the lipstick will stay on longer and my red lips won&#x27;t show through the lipstick.  </li>
<li> I needed it to hide my dark circles from studying &#x27;till the wee hours of morning!  </li>
<li> My only criticizm is that the size of the product has decreased over the years.  </li>
<li> i&#x27;ve used it for years and have had trouble finding it.</li>
<li> Not as thick as previous ones</li>
<li> I have had a hard time finding product.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the Concealer product that I used for years.</li>
<li> So disappointed!</li>

    <li> Not as good as the old type, not as creamy and in different packaging. I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the Concealer product that I used for years.</li>
    <li> The product was not how I thought it would be.  The size was much smaller than anticipated.  The older product was larger.</li>
    <li> This is the best cover-up I have ever used and I don&#x27;t know what I would do if it ever goes out of production.  My only criticizm is that the size of the product has decreased over the years.  I have been buying Max Factor since I was in college in the early 60&#x27;s.  I needed it to hide my dark circles from studying &#x27;till the wee hours of morning!  I now need it to cover my old age dark circles!</li>
    <li> Very good coverage I have had a hard time finding product.  It is the best coverage for me.  I will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer but the case is made of cheap plastic and breaks easily. The company should spend a little more money and make a stronger case.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 40 years.  I use the Medium on my lips first as a base for my lipstick so that the lipstick will stay on longer and my red lips won&#x27;t show through the lipstick.  I also use a lighter shade of this to put just on the dark area of undereye circles after I apply my foundation and before applying my finishing powder.  When I was a lot younger and my lips sometimes peeled, this product would loosen the dead skin on my lips and I could easily peel it right off.  I have ALWAYS used this product and love it!  I think Max Factor took their company overseas so I no longer see it in the stores.  Some on ebay sell it but are asking astronomical prices........I was lucky to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is not the same medium color as I had before, Won&#x27;t buy it again from this Vendor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for dark under eye circles. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as others. It seems slightly greasy. I recommend setting with powder.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put on any makeup without using this cover up first to conceal any blemish or discoloration on my face. I love this product because it never make my skin cakey or looking wrinkley. It blends well!</li>
    <li> It was okay. Max Factor has really downsized the stick. Not as thick as previous ones I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a under eye concealer, this would be sufficient.</li>
    <li> Not as creamy as the the Max Factor Erase that was sold here in the states several years ago. Definitely a different formula. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great concealer that matches my skin color better than anything I&#x27;ve tried locally.  I&#x27;m so pleased that Max Factor is still available through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> The coverage is average for a stick concealer which I use mostly for dark eye circles. Maybe a shade darker might be better.</li>
    <li> just as stated and prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Great old product, not easy to find! Great service, thank you.</li>
    <li> Product is hard to find as discontinued so very happy to be able to find it!! It was gift for Mother so very happy.</li>
    <li> I am a long, long, time Max Factor Fan.  No one else has duplicated their products and now I don&#x27;t think whoever is running Max Factor is duplicating them either.  This product, Erace, doesn&#x27;t come up to standard for me even though it equals others on the market it is not the old ERACE!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the shipment and packaging of the items however, there is just a slight difference in the name of the product that should be noted. I have, for years, used Max Factor Erace Concealer Stick Median however, this says Cover Up Concealer Stick Medium. This product has a fragrance that i am sensitive to and it twists down when trying to apply. The other one, glides on nicer, doesn&#x27;t twist down and has no fragrance. I am now trying to return it. I bought 4, opened and tried one so now i am returning the other 3 and I&#x27;ll get charged the price of one, b/c Amazon is saying it&#x27;s my fault. That is why I wanted to write a review so that you don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did. The other is sold on here, a little more expensive however, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used it for years and have had trouble finding it. It &amp;#34;erases&amp;#34; better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Just like the original</li>
    <li> Although I was very happy with the service and the speed in which this product arrived from overseas, it was not exactly what I had been using for many years and that I used to be able to get here in the U.S.  They must have a slightly different formula.  It is not as creamy or as easily blendable as my former product. It is also a slightly lighter color.  The tube itself is a dark blue rather than the black with the clear cover that I am used to, and there is a slight fragrance that I have not had in the past.  I won&#x27;t reorder, but am having a hard time finding the good old tried and true.</li>
    <li> I used this concealer stick for many years and then could not find them in local stores for years. I finally found them on Amazon and ordered a few in different shades. Unfortunately, the colors are very different from the past and Max Factor has added a strong perfume scent to the product...  and I am allergic to perfume. So disappointed!</li>
