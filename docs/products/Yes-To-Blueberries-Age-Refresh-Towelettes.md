      <li>I have bought many of their products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased SO many different wipes and these are the best...</li>
      <li>I love these wipes.  </li>
      <li>order these all the time, love them...always take them when I travel</li>
      <li>Excellent facial wipes.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>wont use anything else  :-)  </li>
      <li>To Carrot line and most of the Yes To Blueberries line.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin tingle (which I happened to love about the Cucumber line) and is easier on my eye area when removing makeup.</li>
      <li>Love the instructions.  </li>
      <li>Ordered them as Christmas gifts for wife and daughters, absolutely love them.  </li>
      <li>I love the ingredients, but my skin didn&#x27;t like something in them.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE these towelettes.  </li>
      <li>These are the best facial wipes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Really does make my face shine - in a good way.  </li>
      <li>I use these after removing my makeup to make sure that my skin is completely clean.  </li>
      <li>Easy to tuck in your purse or car for a quick refreshing towel.</li>
      <li>like the Ole Henrikksen line of makeup removing wipes, but these do a fine job.</li>
      <li>These really are my favorite of all the Yes to!</li>
      <li>Its gentle on the skin, but effectively removes makeup and dirt.</li>
      <li>Smells good, feels good, actually did clear up my skin and made it look brighter and more evenly toned.</li>
      <li>They were a nice size package and smelled better than other face refreshing towelettes, but they made me break out.</li>
      <li>They have a lovely smell and your face really does feel clean and refreshed after using them.</li>
      <li>Not only are they good for removing makeup, but they are also great at soothing rough skin.</li>
      <li>Still such a good price and does the trick.</li>
      <li>I have used a similar vitamin c wipe that was 3x the cost, and although I loved the results, it just ended up being too pricey.  </li>
      <li>These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes</li>
      <li>They are nice and large and very moist unlike some others.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;For a very good facial cleansing towelette that will not irritate sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I keep these at bedside or in bathroom for a quick freshen up.</li>
      <li>Whereas she is able to use many wipes, this one was somehow different...</li>
      <li>Came quickly, but the product isn&#x27;t as good as other wipes on the market like Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
      <li>These wipes work great and seem to moisturizer better than the other wipes by the same brand.</li>
      <li>I stick to the other two which are good for oily skin.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of moisturizing without a greasy after-feeling.</li>
      <li>And the price is right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to go more natural with my beauty products and have liked other products by this brand</li>
      <li>I still like the cucumber more than the blueberry, but overall, they are a really convenient way to keep your skin clean.</li>
      <li>My favorite-- I use them daily.</li>
      <li>I find that splashing water on my face first or using after showering helps with getting the make up off.  </li>
      <li>I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They get an extra star because they are cruelty free which is very important to me, and because the possibility exists that my skin is more sensitive than average.</li>
      <li>My normal brand ok value, can sting skin sometimes, reseals well, does not dry skin or make me breakout</li>
      <li>Always positive words.  </li>
      <li>They are mild and non-irritating and not heavily scented.</li>
      <li>Because these towelettes are barely moistened, I need 2 of them in order to wipe my face clean of any makeup residue.</li>
      <li>and she really likes them.</li>
      <li>I like how they are gentle.</li>
      <li>Note: Don&#x27;t get the Ole Henrikksen wipes on Amazon, they cost twice as much as they do at Sephora.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for the wipes there</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that is rarely irritated or sensitive.</li>

    <li> These are the best facial wipes I&#x27;ve ever used! Not only are they good for removing makeup, but they are also great at soothing rough skin.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, but the product isn&#x27;t as good as other wipes on the market like Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Still such a good price and does the trick.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, thick and big. Cheaper at drugstore.</li>
    <li> My favorite-- I use them daily.</li>
    <li> I love the smell they take alittle work to get make up off</li>
    <li> I expected these to smell like blueberry and they smell AWFUL!  I could not bear the smell and threw them away!</li>
    <li> order these all the time, love them...always take them when I travel</li>
    <li> All of the Yes To facial wipes made my skin really red and irritated.  I love the ingredients, but my skin didn&#x27;t like something in them.</li>
    <li> These wipes work great and seem to moisturizer better than the other wipes by the same brand.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these.  They smell great and they don&#x27;t irritate my skin the way the grapefruit ones did.  My skin feels soft and refreshed without any stickiness.  I use these after removing my makeup to make sure that my skin is completely clean.  I also love using them at the gym after working out to refreshing up.  Will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I keep these at bedside or in bathroom for a quick freshen up. I like how they are gentle. They are moist and can be used on body too</li>
    <li> Converted to YES from neutragena wipes. This is way better!</li>
    <li> My normal brand ok value, can sting skin sometimes, reseals well, does not dry skin or make me breakout</li>
    <li> These Yes to Blueberry wipes smell off, not like the blueberry I was expecting. I prefer the scents of the Yes to Coconut/Cucumber wipes much more than that of the these wipes, since the Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent, while the Cucumber smells clean &amp; fresh.  My skin is often sensitive and a few times, my face burned after using these, but not the other Yes to wipes. I will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get past the smell, these work ok -- and can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower. I don&#x27;t use them often, just occasionally instead of washing my face, since these are the fastest and easiest way to clean your face. These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. They are made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
    <li> Love these cleansing cloths. Just the right amount of moisturizing without a greasy after-feeling. Great for my aging skin... Adult acne and dryness was my problem. This product fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Dionysia&#x27;s daughter-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very nice makeup removers. I think they do a pretty decent job, especially given the price.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Ole Henrikksen line of makeup removing wipes, but these do a fine job. Note: Don&#x27;t get the Ole Henrikksen wipes on Amazon, they cost twice as much as they do at Sephora.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Yes To Carrots and have been using their products for a while.  I was using Yes to Cucumber face wipes and, while they felt very refreshing, my skin has recently become sensitive due to medical issues, and these Yes to Blueberries face wipes are a much more gentler and soothing alternative.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin tingle (which I happened to love about the Cucumber line) and is easier on my eye area when removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, actually did clear up my skin and made it look brighter and more evenly toned. Paired with another product (yes to grapefruit lotion) they worked wonderfully. I personally liked using this before I went to bed because it feels relaxing  and smells relaxing too. Great product even if you aren&#x27;t using it as an &#x27;age refresh&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I got these because I love the tomato and cucumber wipes. But my skin just felt way to oily after use and I would break out. I stick to the other two which are good for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the wipes there awesome :) smell good and keep me fresh and really work for combination skin like I have...sometimes oily and sometimes dry which works great for me thank you again</li>
    <li> These are great for wiping off the makeup before bed or refreshing for the morning! They aren&#x27;t too drying like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but caused an allergic reaction in one of my daughters... Whereas she is able to use many wipes, this one was somehow different...</li>
    <li> I love these wipes.  I use them daily.  I find that splashing water on my face first or using after showering helps with getting the make up off.  But otherwise a great product! love the smell! Been using Yes To products for over 6 years...wont use anything else  :-)  Never had a problem with skin irritation.  Have used Yes to Cucumber wipes, all the Yes To Carrot line and most of the Yes To Blueberries line.  Really does make my face shine - in a good way.  Love the instructions.  Always positive words.  Yes To a happy face!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this brand through a friend.  I absolutely LOVE these towelettes.  They are great for removing make up quickly and effectively-even eye make up.  They don&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry like some towelettes do, but I feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;They are great for home and travel.</li>
    <li> Find the towelettes refreshing, especially on a hot humid day. Face appears clearer, even skin tone and no fine lines. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Yes products for years and this is one of my favorites. Easy to tuck in your purse or car for a quick refreshing towel. The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering, either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to go more natural with my beauty products and have liked other products by this brand so thought I would give these makeup wipes a try. I do not have sensitive skin at all, but within 30 seconds of using this wipe my face started burning and turned beet red. It also felt very dry and tight. I tried to rinse off any remaining residue and immediately followed with rose hip seed oil, and now my face is just pink with a more subtle burning feeling. Back to the supposedly chemical-laced neutrogena wipes for me!</li>
    <li> These really are my favorite of all the Yes to! flavors.  I love how my skin feels after cleansing with them, and the packable packaging size is also great for travel.</li>
    <li> Ordered them as Christmas gifts for wife and daughters, absolutely love them.  Have begun seeing them in Walgreens drug stores locally as well at similar prices.  Great brand!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use these. They made my eyes burn and left my face feeling oily. I have dry/combination skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE! This has made my face feel so soft and really does get all of the make-up off! I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> These are the best face towelettes. They have a lovely smell and your face really does feel clean and refreshed after using them. They also remove any traces of makeup.</li>
    <li> These are great! I keep a box by my bed, and in my car, and in my desk drawer, and.... well, you get the idea. I have tried several different varieties of the Yes cloths. I still like the cucumber more than the blueberry, but overall, they are a really convenient way to keep your skin clean.</li>
    <li> These result in a skin reaction for me, it took a few days for it to start happening but then it started happening every time and I can no longer use these.  My face turns extremely red like I had a sunburn.  I wash it off and it takes about an hour to go away.  Totally bummed- but I have sensitive skin so maybe it&#x27;s just me.  I can currently use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleansing Clothes, and have used the Yes to Tomatoes and Yes to Grapefruit cloths without a problem in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get an extra star because they are cruelty free which is very important to me, and because the possibility exists that my skin is more sensitive than average.</li>
    <li> Removes make-up so well and smells great. Leaves a tacky residue after drying and makes my skin feel stiff.</li>
    <li> I bought these cleansing towelettes for the convenience of having a product to quickly remove makeup when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face after a long day.  Unfortunately, these towelettes are VERY heavily perfumed and the scent is just too overwhelming.  I found that after using these just a few times that my skin was irritated and I just could not tolerate the very strong scent of these wipes.  If you have allergies, are at all sensitive to scented products or have any skin sensitivity issues, I would steer clear of this product.  And even after you have finished using the product, the scent actually lingers on your skin and you need to thoroughly wash your face - which defeats the purpose of of the towelette and the need for convenience.  Several other reviewers have noted that this was irritating and burned their skin. If your skin is at all sensitive, avoid this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company to let them know that I experienced a problem with the product and could not use it.  My call was routed to some random call center, not even the corporate office, and I was told the company doesn&#x27;t offer refunds per company policy.  I had no way of speaking to someone in the corporate office, only an operator that took down my information.  In short, the company DOES NOT STAND BEHIND ITS PRODUCTS.  I would not recommend doing business with a company this is so consumer-unfriendly.  I refuse to do business with a company that has poor customer service and will not buy any of their products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a very good facial cleansing towelette that will not irritate sensitive skin, I recommend Aveeno or Neutrogena.  They are mild and non-irritating and not heavily scented.</li>
    <li> When I used this product to clean my face, I had an allergic reaction and my face turned red.  I used it for 3 days to rule out other factors, but broke out afterwards each time.  I&#x27;ve used this previously with no problems and wonder if they&#x27;ve changed their formula.</li>
    <li> These smell awful. It&#x27;s a chemical smell that&#x27;s really bad. I held my breath to use them and will never buy them again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take off eye makeup like I hoped it would and it and stings!!</li>
    <li> Because these towelettes are barely moistened, I need 2 of them in order to wipe my face clean of any makeup residue. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its gentle on the skin, but effectively removes makeup and dirt. The smell is very light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> These wipes smell great, and are very gentle. They are especially good for cleaning your face during the day or at night if you are acne prone. Good substitute for washing your face.</li>
    <li> LOVE these.  Bought one pack, then had to buy the 3-pack. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, am 58 but my skin seems much younger.  These remove makeup, moisturize and plump my skin.  This is the ONLY way I remove makeup at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love keeping a pack of these in my desk at work... I commute to work via bike and its nice to freshen up my face when I get there on a warm day.  These smell great and always leave me feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they irritate my face (its odd, that it is only sometimes) and my face will become very red for about 5-10 min afterward.  It&#x27;s odd because I can&#x27;t feel it, it just happens and then feels fine afterwards.  I imagine this is just a personal thing, but figured I&#x27;d add it in case that changes someone&#x27;s mind.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like them but they burned my face. So I gave them to a friend and she really likes them.</li>
    <li> Made me break out.  My skin is not terribly sensitive, but this made me break out.  I tried twice, and the same thing happened both times.  They were a nice size package and smelled better than other face refreshing towelettes, but they made me break out.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes.  They are nice and large and very moist unlike some others.  They smell good and my skin feels great.  I do use face cream afterwards.</li>
    <li> Excellent facial wipes. The yes to brand is a very good brand. I have bought many of their products.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is rarely irritated or sensitive. These wipes did a great job at removing makeup...BUT they caused a burning sensation and flushed/redness that lasted for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cucumber wipes by YesTo before and loved those...I&#x27;ll stick with those from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sidenote: I was a little sad that they smelled nothing like blueberries.)</li>
    <li> I like the say yes to products. The wipes are nice hydrating wipes. I am able to remove most of my makeup but not all. They become harsh on your skin if you scrub. The smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased SO many different wipes and these are the best...BY FAR!  I have used a similar vitamin c wipe that was 3x the cost, and although I loved the results, it just ended up being too pricey.  These are just as good or better than the expensive ones!!!  They smell great and leave my face feeling refreshed without drying me out.  I&#x27;ve got dry, sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t irritate or sting my skin at all.  The wipes use natural ingredients and the wipes ARE COMPOSTABLE so you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about a 1-time use product.  Overall, I&#x27;ll repurchase again and again!</li>
