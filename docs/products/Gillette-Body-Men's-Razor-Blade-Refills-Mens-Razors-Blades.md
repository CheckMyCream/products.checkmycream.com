<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t effectively do any of my body hair. My regular fusion does a better job than this razor. I think Gillette hoodwinked us on this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it says body. The problem with it is, the razor just dulls to quickly. I got the Gillette body shave gel as well and it just wasn&#x27;t any better than my regular razor. The head of the razor is a bit too bulky for certain areas on your body as well. Glad I tried it, and it&#x27;s ok I guess, but I&#x27;ll stick with the Gillette sensor XL.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fits well in hand and functions great as a body razor and for those of us restricted to shaving our heads.</li>
    <li> Nice razor - versatile handle design for no nicks or cuts</li>
    <li> Bought this on CVS and 1st use today pulls hair doesn&#x27;t cut right was bleeding Very Bad.</li>
    <li> I can only say wow and wow is excellent as best they invented gillette for us the only thing men should add little serious two parts but otherwise is excellent made for us men and uncut as other similar articles .... .👍👍😊😊</li>
    <li> So, this is nothing more than a green Venus (Mach3 blade-set with a wider head and silicone handle), marketed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works (a few times)&lt;br /&gt;The wide-flat head works smoothly over body curves (preventing digging)&lt;br /&gt;No wire-strips covering the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It works for about 3 shaves per head&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating strips dry out after the first use and flake away&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating strips work to dull the blades faster&lt;br /&gt;The handle is awkward, small, and becomes slick in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Blades clog very fast, even if only shaving light stubble&lt;br /&gt;Cost per blade/shave compared to Venus or men&#x27;s Mach-3 blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve thought this would work better than a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s razor&amp;#34;, but this is nothing more than a green Venus (which are cheaper).  So, buy a Venus, and if you don&#x27;t want the blades to dull as fast, use Mach-3 heads and go slower, being more careful over certain sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor....Not sure I see much difference between this and the regular power glide I use on my face.</li>
    <li> To call this a body razor is a slap in the face to the customers they must only assume are idiots.  This razor is useless unless you are an adult who hasn&#x27;t reached puberty yet and has the wondrous amazement of having zero to little body hair growth on all or most of your body. It&#x27;s a piece of plastic waste and doesn&#x27;t shave hair for s***. Period. Get a cheap Bic single blade razor and go crazy. Beats the hell outta this marketing disaster.</li>
    <li> Great for the hairy man in your life!  Awesome razor for a great price!</li>
    <li> My favorite razor ever!  Great close shave the first time through.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than my old Gillette Fusion.  My wife uses it to shave her pits.  I occasionally use it for the ol&#x27; coin purse.  No noticeable difference except it&#x27;s not quite as wide.</li>
    <li> awesome product, no irritation at all</li>
    <li> Gillette should be ashamed of charging $8 or $9 for this cheap piece of plastic. I would bet the disposable is more solid; this razor is like picking up a display phone at a cellular store, and you realize it&#x27;s not the real thing because it&#x27;s light and flimsy. I&#x27;m so mad about this cheap product that I&#x27;m done with Gillette, period.</li>
    <li> The razor does not shave well at all. I wonder if I could return it?</li>
    <li> Save your money and just buy regular shaving gel. There is nothing added to this product that make it better or more applicable to use on your body. Actually says on the container &amp;#34;also sold as&amp;#34;.... One of their regulR shaving creams(don&#x27;t remember actual product). This is purely a marketing ploy.</li>
    <li> This has become my dedicated go-to shaver for &amp;#34;downtown&amp;#34;. Its design allows for smooth, effortless shaving of those sensitive areas. It glides easily and I have never encountered a single nick, which is good when you consider what you&#x27;re shaving. Have not used on other parts of my body, so can&#x27;t speak to those. I&#x27;ll refrain from posting a clean-shaven &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pic. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mammal and have never aspired to be a reptile, so I don&#x27;t spend much time shaving other body parts.  However, my face is far from flat, so I thought this might work better then my Gillette Fusion on the curves and angles.  I&#x27;m not always interested in a close shave, so I hoped this would be a tool that would make regular shaving easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty good!  It probably doesn&#x27;t get as close as my Gillette Fusion, but it&#x27;s plenty close enough for most occasions.  I love being able to quickly shave without worrying about nicking myself and just getting it over with ASAP.  The only problem is with shaving under the nose, which doesn&#x27;t work at all, so I either use another razor or clippers to tackle that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s light and easy to grip, because that makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on what I will euphemistically call his more delicate areas, and he loves it. The handle is terrific (and I&#x27;ve used Gilette razors myself, and have always loved the handles). It&#x27;s got a good grip and makes for much easier control. The rounded edges on the razor make shaving around the bits easy and less hazardous. The main complaint he had was that the razor was narrower than he was used to, only by 1 cm or less, but it was enough that it was noticeable and a little irritating. However, the conditioning strip helped with irritation, and even with three blades, he reported this worked as well as four-blade Gillette&#x27;s he&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> Nice wide base for razor, comfortable handle, and great shave. Pretty easy to maneuver around sensitive body areas. Nice close finish.</li>
    <li> For those who prefer to be MANscaped its a MUST have.  Even for areas that are more, shall we say sensitive, it just glides.  It gets extraodinarily close without irritation.  And the shave lasts most of the week for me.  But in fairness, I dont grow a significant amount of body hair naturally.  But for me a tremndous find and great product and priced perfectly.</li>
    <li> Manscaping, many fellows do it, and other just don&#x27;t quite understand why.  While my manscaping work has varied over the years, I usually just shave my face and my noggin, because thin patchy hair on the top of my head just doesn&#x27;t look that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do any type of shaving on my body, it&#x27;s usually my back, and I almost always use an electric razor for that job and then take a standard disposable blade for detailing.  However, I have been known to shave other areas of my body, and whenever I do, it&#x27;s usually that most gentle of areas on a manly man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without going into too much gory detail, Gillette basically put a different paint scheme on the Venus Embrace and dropped the blade count down from five to three.  I guess us guys don&#x27;t need those two extra blades (and honestly, do we really need three?).  The BODY razor does a pretty good job of shaving areas, and for the sake of this review, I shaved my legs, arms, and the special spot as well.  My arms came out the best, excepting the elbows.  I had to go over them with a standard two-bladed disposable razor that I normally use for my face and noggin.  My legs looked pretty good as well.  My nethers were a bit more difficult to shave, and I eventually ended up using my two-bladed razor to finish that area off as well.  Now I&#x27;m clean and breezy in areas that I&#x27;m not normally clean and breezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor held up quite well for the most part, and I found that it was very easy to rinse out any hair build-up between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I go out of my way to purchase one of these bad boys?  Not really.  In fact, I would probably do what everyone else seems to be suggesting, and that is to pick up the Embrace razor instead.</li>
    <li> This is basically a body razor for men.  The only difference beween this and one marketed to women is really the color.  Instead of pink it is manly black and green!  It has that same wide head that is supposed to increase comfort on your delicate, yet manly, skin.  But as far as shaving goes it works just fine for trimming a little excess hair off of your body.</li>
    <li> Got this product free from Gillette, really liked how soft t is i have sensitive skin and it worked great A+ product would buy it again</li>
    <li> Hands down the best razor out. I was shocked to say the least. I highly recommend this razor and looking for more to come from Gillette. My wife thinks the color scheme is awesome. Proud customer.</li>
    <li> I recently was given the opportunity to try the Gilette Body razor for free from the company. Prior to trying this razor, I had always shied away from too much grooming of my body hair. This was because I have sensitive skin and any time I had shaved with typical mens razors I ended up with terrible, painful razor burn. I was a bit nervous to try this razor, but I was hoping I would get a better result. I am pleased to report that this was definitely the case! I got a close shave and had no razor burn! This is a great razor!. In fact, my wife is thinking about purchasing one for herself since I have been raving so much about it.</li>
    <li> i received this produce from Gillette and the gel is  none-foaming which makes it easier to use on the body, now the razor has 3 blades that is so effective that it not only got me the close shave that I was expecting from the Gillette  company but as usual the wife stole my razor and used it on her legs and was really impressed with the rotating head, her words were \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how well it maneuver around my knees\\&quot; I also used it for a touch up and I&#x27;m impress and would definitely recommend this to friends, FYI used it the same day it came 05/22/2014.</li>
    <li> I am not into total body shaving, but I do like to keep things under control. In the past, I have used clippers or the disposable razors I use on my face with good results. Sometimes the razors I have used were a bit hard to use on some body parts, and I got nicked pretty badly and/or got razor burn - not fun. I thought I&#x27;d give this razor a try since it is designed to avoid these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it worked pretty well. Better than my regular razor. Good weight and easy to handle and maneuver. Color a little weird maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one real downside I saw is the price. I do think that $9 is steep - though they do offer a $3 off coupon presently. Replacement blades are available, but are about $4 each. If you body shave often, this could get expensive, unless you reuse blades several times. I personally do not like to reuse after body shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a very good product, but the price needs to come down before I&#x27;d continue with it.</li>
    <li> The blades are spaced solidly further apart, which makes this more effective on larger / denser areas than a regular blade. Enough of a difference to count.</li>
    <li> Great shaver use it about once a month. No issues what&#x27;s so ever</li>
    <li> What can I say - it&#x27;s a Venus (which is a Mach 3 for girls) in a color for guys.  I do think the Fusion is better - oh and I knocked a star because all the Mach 3 cartridges fly off when I tap them on the edge of the sink.  The Fusion is much better in this regard as well.</li>
    <li> 5 blades work so much better.  This is a Venus shaver for men.  Avoid, unless you like pain and bumps.</li>
    <li> Initially I just used a Gillette face razor to take care of business and didn&#x27;t think a product specifically tailored for the body would be any different.  I was wrong.  The lightweight design and the curved head coupled with the lubrication parts make maintenance a much easier and effortless affair.  Looking back on this, and comparing it, this looks like a razor my wife has.  It took a while for people to realize some men like grooming.  :)</li>
    <li> The new Gillette Body razor is a great razor both for shaving the body (as the name suggests) and can even be used for shaving your face as long as you don&#x27;t need to get into a tight spot (like the edges under your nose or ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette made the first razor that I used to shave as a teenager, so I&#x27;m very used to this brand. Essentially, this is just a modified version of the Gillette razors that they&#x27;ve been offering for women for several years. Gillette just changed it from pink to green and made a few slight changes to the shape so it doesn&#x27;t stand out like a lady&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating strips really help to deliver a smooth shave, but they wear out quickly - long before the blades start to dull - so you end up having to either shave without the lubricating strips or switch the blades out before they really need to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my biggest complaint about this razor. I give it high marks across the board, but Gillette either needs to change the formula for the lubricating strips so they last longer or Gillette needs to make the replacement blades MUCH cheaper. The replacement blades for the Gillette Body razor are very, very expensive so that might be a reason to consider a cheaper alternative even though this razor delivers a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Gillette makes the lubricating strips last longer or makes the replacement blades cheaper then I&#x27;d give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> So I spent some time with the razor today, that was given to me by gillett to try it out. The feel of this razor fits so well inside your hand and the non-slip grip makes it a breeze to use in the shower. The open back of the the razor made it easy to clean and get the thick body hair out of the way. I blew threw shaving my back and shoulders with out the slightest discomfort. It left me feeling like a babies bottom. Over all the best body razor I have ever used. It held the right weight in all the right place</li>
    <li> Thanks Gillette for the opportunity to examine your new product, the &amp;#34;Gillette Body Razor.&amp;#34; Initial impressions of the product point to this being a well made product that fits somewhere between disposables and mid level cartridge based razors (I absolutely love my Fusion Proglides!) but, lets face it, we are talking personal grooming vs a beard blade. The Body razon has a feel/grip reminiscent of soft plastic fishing lures. When I have this in my hand, it is very comfortable to hold and I have confidence that it is not going to slip from my hands. The color is superb, it will not be lost amongst the other showering tools! The one major item that is holding me back from rating higher is the shaving angle, starts too harsh yet ends before a standard 90º shaving angle. As far as the cartridge goes, they got the job done but maybe it&#x27;s time to consider a wider cutting path. I would love a wider blade with a detailer on the reverse side of the cartridge. I also had issues with clogging, and I have fine to medium hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shower blade that I will buy replacement cartridges for. Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Floyd</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor, along with their Gillette BODY Shave Gel, about a month ago to test and review. I&#x27;ve been using both items nearly everyday and I am very surprised. Normal face razors, in my experience, tend to last around 2 weeks before needing to be changed. This razor is still doing an amazing job! Everything&#x27;s still coming out very smooth. I decided to put this razor to the test, too. See, I have rather course hair and most razors don&#x27;t tend to stand up to it very well. I also decided to leave this razor in the shower, in the way of the water, and I even had my wife use it when she needed a razor. This razor has outlasted any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used and is still acting as if it&#x27;s brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water temperature doesn&#x27;t tend to make a difference, for those of you wondering about that. Personally, I&#x27;ve never experienced razor burn with this razor either. Considering it&#x27;s only 3 blades, it&#x27;s very impressive. The rubber grip on the razor is very useful, too. Not once have I lost or dropped the razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated above, I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month. I&#x27;ve also let my wife use it when she needs, even though it&#x27;s not recommended, and this razor is still cutting as if it&#x27;s new. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, rather long lasting body razor. Also, spend the extra couple dollars and buy yourself the Gillette BODY Shave Gel, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor compliments of Gillette and I must admit that I was quite pleased with the results. In fact it made me wonder why no one has thought if this years ago! The soft flexible rubber handle fits quite comfortable in my hand and also making it very handy for use in the shower and the like when your hands tend to be a bit slippery. However I would have liked to see a case for this razor and possibly also a single blade on the top for edge trimming and the like when your manscaping.</li>
    <li> Great razor for a very close shave!  The price a awesome for the razor.  The razor had a much better shave than I expected!</li>
    <li> I received this Gilette Body Razor for free, but ended up using it as a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razor for shaving as I was in a pinch and didn&#x27;t have one of my usual shaving razors (also Gilette.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, any time you hold something sharp against your face, you want to make sure you&#x27;re not going to end up bleeding, and since this body razor has a contour (unlike my normal razors), I approached shaving with a certain amount of caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, I had a very close and easy shave - this actual does a better job than my regular razors, though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive.  Probably works really well on other parts of the body, but I can recommend even conventional use.</li>
    <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t tell him this is merely a [[ASIN:B0001LQGFG Gillette Venus Divine Sensitive Women&#x27;s Razor]] with a color change, and don&#x27;t offer him one of your replacement cartridges to make up for all the times you&#x27;ve used his razor on your legs;... believe me, he&#x27;d rather not think about it!  However, the reason he&#x27;s unlikely to find it as useful as you do is a matter of scale, not its pink and pastel origins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to reach similar levels of clear cutting, your average woman is going to be faced with a little weeding; your average man is going to be faced with some heavy duty power mowing, perhaps even a campaign of deforestation.  For the latter, power tools are probably going to be required like this one: [[ASIN:B007VB50LU Philips Norelco BG2038 Bodygroom Plus]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, unless your mower of choice comes with its own razor cartridge like this one does: [[ASIN:B001VEK1GW Braun bodyCruzer Men&#x27;s Body Groomer, Titanium]], you won&#x27;t be able to get quite as close a shave, and if you want to, this product might be just the thing to finish off with,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unless you&#x27;d rather keep using your lady&#x27;s Gillette Venus when she isn&#x27;t looking, that is.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product from Gillette . I thought it was very and smooth on my skin, I would recommend this to friends. I got this product from Gilette for free and I was very happy try to it . Did not leave any nicks or anything during the shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gilette</li>
    <li> Gillette send me this razor to try out and I feel its just an average throw away razor feel. I have been using this razor for a few weeks now and the blades dull very very fast.  The handle is made of rubber but the grip becomes slippery when it gets wet.  The only good thing I can see from this razor is the added moisture strips on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone that is already using a Gillette Mach 5.  Its a down grade from that razor.</li>
    <li> Gillette Body product is amazing versatile with a gliding close shave razor that moves with your bodies curves. The three bladed razor coupled with the Gillette Body non-foaming gel leave your skin feeling smooth and clean. The razor handle is fully covered in gel for a no slip shave. I would recommend this product for anyone who shaves regularly.</li>
    <li> I got this free from Gillette and better to know that this is the one make shave smooth and easy on body.I like the blade which work for what they are made for. This Product is really amazing for those who have sensitive skin although product didn&#x27;t mention though i can say by my own experience. Great to cover up neck line area,underarms and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to all those who want the best razor for the body.</li>
    <li> For what it is, it works..... It&#x27;s a razor, and you can shave with it.  It&#x27;s modeled after the women&#x27;s line of razors made by Gillette, the Venus. (I only know this because my fianc&amp;eacute;e uses those and I noticed the similarity while looking at her razor hanging next to mine). I felt the razor was a little lightweight, at least for my preferences. I like a little heft in my hand. The extra lubricant strips were nice versus the singular strip you&#x27;d get on a regular razor. It&#x27;s certainly not meant for the face, as you can&#x27;t get in nice and tight like you would need for your upper lip. I did experience more razor bumps, though that&#x27;s possibly more a fault of the shave gel instead of the razor. The razor itself felt smooth in operation. I do like the green color too. I probably won&#x27;t make a habit out of purchasing these since my current razor preference is sufficient. However for someone looking to have a dedicated &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; razor without having to use their normal razor, this is a good fit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he has been very satisfied with its use.  Body shaving has become very popular among ymostly younger people and my son tells me the the razor did a great job and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why. I purchased for shaving my back. It does not work very well for me. The standard 3 blade with pivot head shaves much better. I do not understand why</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first ordered this product from Gillette. Is it really necessary to buy a different razor for your body? After using the Gillette Body Razor for a few weeks now, I&#x27;ve realized that it is necessary to have a different type of razor for those certain parts.  This razor glides better than any &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; razor over your body and around those weird areas.  When paired with the Gillette Body Gel, there is absolutely no pull or tug of any hairs and no irritation as I&#x27;ve had with other razors.  Also it&#x27;s light weight and grip make it easier to handle when attempting to sculpt around different parts.  Overall, I feel as though this razor is a must or your body,  Ditch the regular razors and use the Gillette Body Razor.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Body Razor to try for free from Gillette.  I was thinking upon receiving it what is so special about this razor?  Once I recieved it in the mail and tried it out I found out it was super!  It cut through the hair like it wasn&#x27;t nothing.  So much quicker and easier!  Definetly an A+ razor!  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I thought that this razor was made for shaving the male body. I discovered that it was the same thing than ladies Venus-blade, just the colors were &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, black and dark green...</li>
    <li> I received this razor from the brand and i gotta tell ya this razor is amazing it works like i charm i would recommend to razor to all my guy friends!!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Body razor was great. Came in a single package with a cool black and green color scheme. The razor reminded me of a Venus razor with the shape of the head. The 3 blade system worked well, however I prefer the 5 blade system, more blades less friction. The Gillette Body razor seems to be the first of its kind marketing to guys specifically as a body razor. Overall 4 out of 5. My only complaint was that it wasn&#x27;t a powered razor. I prefer the power razors as opposed to the standard ones but that just my preference. It makes a great body razor and not really meant as a face razor.</li>
    <li> I received my new Gillette Body razor in the mail the other day and decided it was time for a good shave. I also used to Gillette Body Gel, which was incredible!! Not only does the razor look pretty cool with the black and green design. It definitely gets the job done! I did not have to go over any spots again once I shaved over it once, which is miraculous to me because I have such tough facial hair! I&#x27;m in love with this razor and definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a good, fresh shave! I will most certainly be making another trip to the store for either more cartridges for my razor, or even another razor. It&#x27;s that good!!! :)</li>
    <li> This product worked very well. The handle was very comfortable and has a good grip. The cartridge went on easily and provided a close shave. I felt comfortable with it at all times and wasnt concerned about getting cut. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Body Razor in the mail about 2 weeks ago from Gillette. I have to say the first week I was very impressed by how well it gets the job done. It truly is a razor built for the whole BODY! :) During the summer time I usually always shave my back and chest. This razor is uniquely made to shape all around hard to get areas with no problem. It silkens your skin as it shaves over every part. I am so impressed by the quality of this razor! I love the green and black design, it makes it really stand out.. The gripped handle makes it easy to hold and lowers the risk for cutting yourself because the grips make it easy for you to have control of the razor so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands. I told my wife that we will definitely be getting another one of these for me! Thank you so much Gillette! :)</li>
    <li> My only real concern with the product is I believe it took an excessive amount of force to come to a complete shave.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from Gillett. It is a good solid razor that does the job, but I did not find anything about it to set it apart from other solid razors that are out there.  From the pivoting action to the lubricated strips, other razors offer the same.  The lubricating strips are a plus on any razor and I&#x27;d include them as a plus on this one.  While I don&#x27;t feel they do much on a first pass (dues to shaving cream/gel being in place) they are great for second or third passes. But again, other razors offer the same lubricated strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept my rating at 4-stars due to the lightweight of the razor.  There are other similar razors out there that have a heavier body.  I prefer that feel.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to manipulate around wiuthout fear of doing damage to a place you would not want a &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bought this with the Gillette Body Gel. Using both I have to admit it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced either &#x27;down there&#x27; or from other Gillettes on my face. It&#x27;s very smooth. No nicks. Follows contours extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the comfortable grip and feel I&#x27;ve got good control over the razor. It could use a blade cover but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The work is always with us, even when we shave. Even great writers need to look human, though, and some areas are hard to get to with traditional razors. I was intrigued by this Gillette \\&quot;Body\\&quot; Razor for a number of reasons; chief among them because A) I think Gillette makes the very best drugstore razors and B) Who doesn&#x27;t need something tailored for their nooks and crannies? We tested it out at my house for a month, so read on for stubbly details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is rather vague about exactly what you are supposed to be shaving (or as they put it, \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, which somehow makes me think of Dwayne Johnson dressed as Monet) but they do state that you are not to lend this razor to your lady. Your lady is supposed to be using the Venus Embrace. While it&#x27;s true that people shouldn&#x27;t share razors for hygienic reasons, I feel this razor would be excellent for a woman, because the small contoured head is perfect for getting around the curves in the knee area and under the arms. So man or woman feel free to use this razor. Gillette is not the boss of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like on all their excellent razors, the handle grip is very sturdy and slip-resistant for shower use. The blades cut very well, but not quite as well as the Fusion and Proglide. I don&#x27;t know why. On the dry skin surrounding my knees I got a bit of razor burn, but otherwise all was excellent. In my opinion, this razor will not work without shave cream or gel (I&#x27;ve had Gillette razors that really didn&#x27;t need the lubrication, but this one does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could use the \\&quot;Body\\&quot; for all your shaving needs, but the smaller head is going to make shaving large areas really really tedious and dull the blades quickly. I am too lazy to switch razors mid-shower, so I use it for everything, which is foolish. I am saving up wise behavior for bigger battles. I don&#x27;t shave my face, though. If you are shaving certain areas of the body, it would be gross to use the same razor as you do for your face. Don&#x27;t make me explain it any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deducting 1/2 star for the slight razor burn and the small inferiority to the other Gillette products in terms of cutting power. 4.5 stars rounded up to five, and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: B+&lt;br /&gt;I read once that Gillette spent a whopping 750 million dollars developing the MACH3 razor. I think BIC probably spent 40 cents developing theirs.lain it any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deducting 1/2 star for the slight razor burn and the small inferiority to the other Gillette products in terms of cutting power. 4.5 stars rounded up to five, and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: B+&lt;br /&gt;I read once that Gillette spent a whopping 750 million dollars developing the MACH3 razor. I think BIC probably spent 40 cents developing theirs.</li>
    <li> I get that this razor is made for more sensitive areas, but I just don&#x27;t find it effective enough. I can feel the stubble right after shaving. It just doesn&#x27;t produce a close enough shave. I prefer the shave from my Gilette Fusion Power razor, which does just fine in the more sensitive areas. This body razor is also a bit slippery when soapy wet, despite it designed for use in the shower. After a few uses, the cartridge part started to fall off easily as well. Not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this razor after my other razor broke, this razor is so smooth the extra strips used for lubricating seem to make the razor glide so much easier than any other razor I&#x27;ve used. The handle is very ergonomic and easy to hold even in the shower</li>
    <li> As soon as i got product i went to try it out. I have been needing to shave bad . as soon a i finished i could tell the difference with the other products i have been trying. i will def be purchasing this in store and sharing with my friends.</li>
    <li> It normally takes me 15 minutes to shave my back. I have to go over and over the same spot to get a close shave. I got to try the Gillette body shaver free from Gillette so I was already on board. However, after I tried it I was really sold. This razor gave such a close shave. It only took me half the time to shave as well!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I really like this razor. It gets a really nice close shave. My wife likes it too!. Anyways I didn&#x27;t like how lightweight it is. I feel like it would break easily. I like when razors are heavy duty.  But it does its job! I would recommend this to someone who likes the lightweight aspect and also to someone who likes a close shave! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Gillette hooked me up with a free trial, awfully nice of them. Gave a good clean shave, and glides well over contours and tricky areas. Much better than other cheaper razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. Grips well when wet, but pretty chintzy really. I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last very long.The moisture pads on it are pretty nice but nothing special. Definitely better than traditional razors with regards to &#x27;manscaping&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette for about 2 weeks now. Granted, I have a full, light beard but shave my neck/under my chin and my cheek bone line about every other day. I was a little concerned about the size of the cartridge but that concern was laid to rest quickly. The blade literally glided across my skin effortlessly and the swivel ball kept the blade close against my skin at all times with minimal pressure. This razor far exceeded my expectations. That being said, I am a bit apprehensive about the cost of the replacement cartridges. Give the limited area I shave, the current cartridge I have been using for 2 weeks seems to be still be cutting as close and comfortably as day 1 - so I may get a month out of 1 cartridge which would make the cost a lot more easy to swallow. I would recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s so smooth.. I have not nicked my skin, no irritation, etc. 4 Stars based on overall cost - but 5 star performance.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Works great for man or woman. Smooth shave, takes corners nicely and no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Holy cow i knew that Gillette made good razors but wow i found the one for me very good easy to maneuver and i did not cut my self the price for the cartridge i would not pay!! otherwise if i see it on sale i would shurly buy it but over all avery good razor</li>
    <li> The Gillette Body Razor was extremely easy to use.  The package was easily opened, and the razor itself is strongly build and fits comfortably in my hand.  I used the razor to shave the back of my neck and my upper arms.  Both areas went very smoothly with zero irritation the next day which matches the claims of Gillette.  The only issue I had is the blades, like all of todays popular multi-blade razors are flat and do not flex so shaving around curved areas takes repetitive swipes.</li>
    <li> Not all men shave below the neck, but for those that do, Gillette just made your life easier. A few weeks ago, I received the Body Razor for free from Gillette to try it out. Having used Gillette products before, I expected it to be a good quality product. And it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Body Razor was specifically made for body hair. Unlike electric body groomers which tend to irritate the skin and leave cuts in loose skin, the razor in this pack utilizes three perfectly-placed blades for a smooth shave your body will love. The ergonomic design of the razor, with its smooth but strong grip and replaceable moving head, provides more control and a closer shave. Also unlike many other razors, the Gillette Body Razor has three lubricating strips for a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of razors and power groomers, but not only do they irritate the skin, they cause rashes once the hair starts growing back. With the Gillette Body Razor, even the hair grew back smoothly and without causing irritation or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unless you enjoy the irritation caused by regular razors or groomers, do yourself a favor and try the Gillette Body Razor. Your body will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Gillette Body Razor. I received my razor from Gillette so I can try it out. I was skeptical about it at first since other razor brands are always lying that they are the best, but Gillette stands up to it&#x27;s words.  It is honestly the best razor I have used in my life so far. It is so soft and yet it works wonders. I have used the same razor for 8 times now and the blades work as if they were being used for the first time. I will absolutely keep buying this razor. I recommend it to all of you men, and even women.</li>
    <li> I love it. My girlfriend cant keep her hands off of my face lately. I recieved this as a sample from Gillette, and they have definitely out done their selves this time.</li>
    <li> I am use to buying razors with 5 blades because it makes me think I&#x27;ll receive and better and closer shave so I was a bit unsure about whether this 3 blade Gillette razor would do the trick. Well I was very happy when I did use it, it was easy to use. I like that the head of the razor was flexible and moved well against my skin, it seemed to adjust to the \\&quot;terrain\\&quot; of my skin and not tug on the hair. It left a smooth and clean shave. Thank you to Gillette for allowing me to try out this product.</li>
    <li> Worked great for one shave. Now I can&#x27;t even get it to cut hair. Doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I apply pressure or what direction I go. Might be too many pads/lubricating strips so the blades cant get to the hair. Not sure, but this was a waste and it&#x27;s off to the trash. Not worth the money to find out if it was a one off problem. Way too many other razors out there that will do just as good a job for half the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I got it for free from the brand and it works great! It keeps my skin super smooth and soft after each shave. The grip on the handle is very soft and comfortable as well!</li>
    <li> In order to keep this review really simple, I broke this down in the good and the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing: I understand the need to have a Gillette Body, but what makes this razor any different than other Gillette razors targeted towards men. If you&#x27;re going to specifically advertise towards men, make SIGNIFICANT changes in the design or components of the razor. Don&#x27;t just put a new color on there and call it a brand new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- A lot of rubber on the handle made it easy to grip in the shower allowing for more precision and less cuts.&lt;br /&gt;- shaving is effortless, not a lot of energy is needed to cut the hair unlike other razors (but this razor is brand new. may be different in a couple of months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- As an African American male, my facial hair is curly meaning I have trouble with ingrown hairs and razor bumps. I&#x27;ve tried many razors but wanted to give this one a chance. This razor caused more irritating bumps rather than helping to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;-It handles flat surfaces (chest, arms) well but didn&#x27;t do so well on curves, such as my jawline which gave me a couple of cuts on my jaw.&lt;br /&gt;-I also wish the cartridge was a little bigger to cover more area.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was very disappointed I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette person.  The Fusion is great on the face, but this body razor is junk by comparison.  While shaving the one part of your body you don&#x27;t want to cut, I got nicked several times in one shave and also in subsequent shaves.  It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave on the chest either-don&#x27;t buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I purchased the ladies (yes ladies) Shick HydroSilk-that is the razor you want if you are shaving downtown or your chest-never nicked myself once in 6 months!  (It&#x27;s light blue better than pink).  I&#x27;m going back to my ladies shick it is a lot safer!!</li>
    <li> So Gillette was awesome enough to send me this new razor and shave gel but I used it and I feel it was just average and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idk about you but when I shave body hair I do it in the shower. Clean up is easier and hair washes down the drain. Easy. I used this razor 4-5 times. Times 1-2 great. It was sharp cut through the pubes nicely no pull no tugging. No problems. Times 3-4 I noticed the built in lube strip dried out and was wearing off. :/&lt;br /&gt;4-5th time it was gone. Broke apart and the blades dulled and It started pulling Very disappointing. My Gillette pro glide fusion is better.&lt;br /&gt; But thanks Gillette for sending me the free product in exchange for the review!</li>
    <li> Honestly I was a bit skeptical about using a body razor, mostly because &amp;#34;those are for women&amp;#34; but I decided to join the 21st century. I received my body razor from Gillette and tried it out. The shave was smooth and clean without any hassle.I was surprised to find that it cut smooth with just one pass considering it has only 3 blades. The razor cartridge allowed for a close shave without any nicks. The only reason I gave this razor a rating of 4 stars instead of 5 is because I like a razor that is a little heavier but that&#x27;s just personal preference the razor did what it was supposed to perfectly.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free trial. It doesn&#x27;t shave as nice as some other razors I have tryed. Clogs very easy leaves a smooth finish but doesn&#x27;t stay smooth as long as my Norma razor does wouldn&#x27;t buy for the price of the razor</li>
    <li> Works good for legs but not armpits</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad Gillette decided to use three blades, consumers have been duped into believing more is better, it&#x27;s simply not true. I use double-edged razor for my face, and would never use anything else. However, using a double-edge razor for my body and privates is what nightmares are made of. This razor offers a precise and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the difference between a male and female razor blades? Oh that&#x27;s right, there aren&#x27;t any. The female counterpart, the Venus, costs $20 for 8 refills, while this razor costs $15 for 4. The only difference between the two is the rubber grip on this blade. Gillette, along with all other blades, need to stop with the marketing gimmick. All razors are unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is a very good blade. It&#x27;s only downfall is that is it more expensive than the Venus. There is no reason to spend more on this razor.</li>
    <li> For obvious reason, I allowed my husband to test this. He has very sensitive skin and always struggles with razor bumps and other skin irritations (ie. redness and burning) whenever he shaves on any part of his body and it doesn&#x27;t matter what type of cream he uses; there is always a problem. He used this razor two days in a row and reported no irritations. I didn&#x27;t see any either. On the weekly grocery trip, we bought another package and I think he is going to stick with these long-term. So, they are definitely worth looking into.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit to using a Venus razor in the past. It worked great for body shaving and this is really no different, although it is in a much manlier color.</li>
    <li> Manscaping can be tedious when you are using a small razor. Plus, no one wants to use the same razor for his face and man-parts. For the more secure man, women&#x27;s razors do the trick just fine. They are smoother, have more blades, and contour better for those &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of us, there&#x27;s Gillette Body. It&#x27;s a women&#x27;a razor for men. What makes it for men instead of for women? It&#x27;s green and says Gillette. I can&#x27;t think of any way it could be more manly.</li>
    <li> i got this free from Gillette to review that being said this is not a bad razor it works fairly well it comes complete with two good grips to choose from, a front grip for detail and tight spaces and a back end thumb like grip for large areas and long stretches. the rubber on this thing gives it a great none slip feel even under running water .But it just lacks that put away for later use feel. It has this kinda cheap plastic feel to it that&#x27;s light weight but maybe a little to light it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re holding much just a piece of plastic but it is priced fairly. i don&#x27;t really seeing this product going beyond the review period i&#x27;m just not willing to put money into something that doesn&#x27;t feel like it would last a while. although if you a guy who spends his time manscaping i could see how this grip would make that job all the easier.</li>
    <li> Looks like your wife&#x27;s Venus in manly colors but works so much better then any razor I&#x27;ve tried so far. Combine it with the body gel and you&#x27;ve got a great pair!</li>
    <li> works exceptionally well to trim without nicking or abrading..... never thought it would be possible. I do use this with the parallel product by Gillette - the body gel that supports a trouble-free shaving. Just remember to clean the blade very frequently during shaving....</li>
    <li> Worked great for me. Does what it claims. Of course everybody has different body types, skin sensitivity and hair conditions to all have the same results. But I was pleasantly impressed. Wish the quality of the razor itself was more  like the pro glide series razor. Has the weight of a disposable one. Very light. Would also like to see a 5 blade version in the next incarnation. I&#x27;m sure this is version 1  so we will have to wait and see. As always with Gillette products they do end up evolving into awesome products but first versions are bare bones. Nevertheless I like it and will keep using it. It does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. For those of you who &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; certain areas of your body, word of advice. Trim first before you shave it. You won&#x27;t run into those &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; issues. Ultimately we will have to wait until the year 2025 when Gillette releases  the Nuclear Fusion Pro Glide Entire Body Laser Razor. Then my friends we will be in all our glory!</li>
    <li> Much better than expected.  The razor head is thinner than a gillette women&#x27;s razor making it work better clean built up hair better and make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s Body Razor is definitely a step up from other disposable men&#x27;s razors on some counts. The handle is a fun color, and the whole thing is a great ergonomic shape. There is a significant amount of lubrication for a close non-irritating shave, and it does provide a fairly close shave in areas where I have shaved before (ie my legs where the hair isn&#x27;t super long or coarse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest let down with the Body Razor is that it only has three blades. Many comparable women&#x27;s razors have five blades, which is handy when you are trying to make a minimal number of passes over sensitive areas with a lot of previously unshaved body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it against my wife&#x27;s razor - one on each leg, and while it outperformed my old razors my wife thinks her&#x27;s gave me a smoother finish.</li>
    <li> Try it you might like it.  It&#x27;s a good razor but I actually like the regular Mach 3 that I have better for those hard to shave areas...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this razor is anything special went back to using my other five blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using my wife&#x27;s razor for those sensitive areas</li>
    <li> This was a  great find for body grooming,,,!!!&lt;br /&gt;you can get additional razors as needed</li>
    <li> Terrible... Has zero benefit over a normal razor. In fact my other razors work better then this. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Glides like no other razor..no pain, takes the hair off smoothly and in one motion..really seems like it&#x27;ll be a must have item in my grooming regime. Worth the buy! Anybody moaning, no idea why, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s fresh and this is coming from somebody with plenty of excess hair to remove!</li>
    <li> Normally i have a problem with getting razor burn or not a great shave from my razors but i dont have that problem with this razor! thank you gillette and bzzagent</li>
    <li> The Gilette Body Razor, supplied as a free sample from Gillette, was a great introduction to body grooming. Just in time for summer, the razor arrived and was very easy to use. It was flexible and proved to be a great tool for body grooming. I have been a user of Gillette products for years and this razor was just as well made as their facial razors</li>
    <li> When I first received my razor from Gillette, I was a little skeptical, as I was used to a razor with more than three blades.  This didn&#x27;t turn me off from using it, I was just used to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before diving in head first and shaving all over, I performed a test under controlled conditions (as controlled as possible).  I first did a body shave with my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; razor, using a new head and my standard shaving cream.  results were as expected, not anything special, just clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I let my hair grow out again, and this time I used the Gillette Body Razor with Non Foaming Gel.  WOW!  What a difference.  I normally don&#x27;t boast about a smooth Man-scaped area, but this was something different!  I felt incredibly smooth and it lasted for almost three days before I got any stubble back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be too crazy about controlled conditions, I tried the Gillette razor with my standard shaving cream as a third study.  The results weren&#x27;t as exciting as it was with the Non Foaming Gel, Standard OK shave job, same as the control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall experience:  I highly recommend getting this razor, but you will definitely have to use the suggested Non Foaming Gel to experience optimal shaving results.  Trust me when I say it would be worth it!</li>
    <li> This razor works well and does last a pretty long time, but ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually its not as good as Venice Embrace which is a little bigger and has 5 blades.  The  Venice cartridge fits the Body razor handle and is less than $3 each versus almost $5 for the mens version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is trying to take advantage by tricking men into paying more for a less capable product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the design of this razor. Gets a very close shave anywhere....and I really mean anywhere. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Received the Body Razor from Gillette and I must say that I am extremely happy with it. This is the first time I have successfully shaved my chest without cutting it at all. I don&#x27;t have to shake out the blades as much as I would a regular razor and it was getting everything in one swipe. Smooth and painless. at one point I looked to make sure it was actually doing the job because it didn&#x27;t feel like it. but it was. I asked my wife right away to go buy me more of these. I&#x27;ve been doing weight lifting and hard workouts, I really don&#x27;t want my body covered in hair that will trap sweat. Usually I have a very Hairy chest but this solved that. I would give this razor 5 stars for sure and would recommend this to my friends, especially those who hate having chest hair like I do. The shape of the handle is easy to hold and you get a good grip so no slipping into a cut. Anyone that gets this will not be disappointing and that&#x27;s my honest opinion. I will be sticking with this in the future.</li>
    <li> I personally enjoyed &amp; have shared my reviews with my personal family and friends. The razor blades are amazing the gel in un-believable and feels so expensive! I really have 1 con which is the actual handles feels more like a girls razor would or should be compared to a man’s razor. But would I buy this again?! Well I already have bought this for me and a few family members. This was sent to me by Gillette Razors for a review*</li>
    <li> Seems to give a closer shave-  Noticed some  bumps the next day but those went away have went away quickly</li>
    <li> This is the same handle as my wife&#x27;s Venus razor, but the cartridges are not as good as hers.  With the [[ASIN:B0072KNPKI Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Women&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills 3 Count]], she gets five blades, not three, and there&#x27;s whole lot of skin lotion on there to deal with skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have more manly colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best deals for cartridges for her razor are generally found at a Warehouse store on sale.  When that happens, she stocks up!</li>
    <li> Not a close shave AT ALL. Ill stick to my Schick hydro...really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> awesome price great deal</li>
    <li> i love it  gillette you&#x27;re the best</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;d rather use my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
    <li> The best thing Gillete has EVER put out BAR, NONE</li>
    <li> Love this razor very easy to use, there is not pulling or tugging and the most important thing that it does not irritate your skin</li>
    <li> Great razor to shave your body with and keeps you from getting less cuts with shave gel and lubricated guards on actual shaver.</li>
    <li> Just tried my new Gillette &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; razor that I got for shaving my head. The results were horrible. It left more stubble than I have after 2 days of NOT shaving. I went back with my Gillette Fusion razor to do what the Body razor is incapable of doing...a nice clean shave. Disappointing Gillette...don&#x27;t fall for the hype, guys!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product.  Works so much better than my Fusion</li>
    <li> So much nicer than a normal razor</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought, and is better than similar products designed for shaving your face.  Worth the purchase for manscaping.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Its a gimmick and I should have known better.  Guess I was just bored and wanted to try something new.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving all of your dude areas.</li>
    <li> great little razor for those specific spots</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually shave anything on my body but I did want to see the performance of this. It did what it said it would- shaved close. The set up of the handle makes it easy to use as well. Back hair begone!</li>
    <li> So Gillette takes a woman&#x27;s razor and colors it in &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; colors and pawns it off as a body razor for men.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like it.  The rounded head does make &amp;#34;navigation&amp;#34; easier vs. a square head razor, but honestly I&#x27;ve never had a &amp;#34;navigation&amp;#34; issue.  Gillette&#x27;s body razor is light and feels like a disposable, but it&#x27;s not.  Even though they do make a disposable version.  There is only one real reason you would need a separate body razor from your face razor and that is irritation.  If you shave body hair and then shave your face, it&#x27;s going to be an uncomfortable shave at times.  So having a second razor for your body makes sense.  Does it have to be this one?  That&#x27;s up to you.</li>
    <li> Did not get the body shave I expected with this razor get better results with the face razor</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor. Easy too use. I&#x27;ll use it on my face when i&#x27;m in a rush without any shaving cream, and it&#x27;s smooth without any irritation.</li>
    <li> At first, I gave it all star review. But, after using it a few more days, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed! I love Gillette razors...I have specific needs due to my facial hairs growth, strength and curl. The way this was promoted for the Body, I thought it&#x27;d be just as good as the Sensor which can last me quote a while &amp; never give bumps, ingrown hair, etcetera. But, I&#x27;d rather use my Gillette Sensor for facial hair on my body than this new version that is made for the Body!!</li>
    <li> How do you get guys to buy more than one razor.  Moreover, how can you sell the basic woman&#x27;s razor to men.  Answer-market it for the metrosexual male who manscapes.  This razor is very much like my wife&#x27;s razor, which makes sense because manscaping covers some of the very areas she shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does an excellent job of trimming in complicated, crowded private places.  If you prefer the hairless look, this product will do the job nicely.  I would only recommend that you compare prices with your wife/significant others razor to see if there is a price break either way.  You may can save some money</li>
    <li> This is a razor which makes body shaving easy and smooth.  It&#x27;s great for those who like to keep the body trimmed but don&#x27;t want to use their same face razor.  It glides well and takes the curves easy.  My hubby wanted as soon as he saw it and appreciates having it.  We definitely feel it&#x27;s a good value and performs well.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of a razor designed for the male body as I wasn&#x27;t sure why this product is different from facial razors or women&#x27;s razor. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to reinvent the wheel to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is easy to use. The handle is nice and it works well over the areas that need shaving. I don&#x27;t think its any different from a women&#x27;s Venus razor, but it might not need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is whether or not this is a necessary product. If you&#x27;re really into shaving your body, this might be worth a try. Otherwise, I&#x27;d probably skip it and use your standard razor if you need to.</li>
    <li> After having used my normal shaving razor for so long and not being very comfortable, this was a welcome change. I wouldn&#x27;t even tried it if Gillette hadn&#x27;t sent me an online coupon for it. It is very comfortable to use and when I used it in the shower, I didn&#x27;t even have to use any soap. I gave a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Body Razor from Gillette and must say that I am extremely happy with it. This is the first time I have successfully shaved without cutting it at all. I don&#x27;t have to shake out the blades like a regular razor and it was getting everything in one swipe.

I will be sticking with this in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Best razor i have yet to try! Everyone should buy it for a great shave! Got it free from the company ! Recommended to everyone</li>
    <li> love it dont really even need shaving cream with this. and easy to get hair off razors. I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I liked using the Gilette Body razor.  I usually use an electric shaver, but last night I tried this new one  and it got a very smooth, close shave without leaving red razor burn behind.  The gel from the razor itself was slimey and moisturizing, which I really like.  It was gliding over my skin and didnt seem to have a problem with the coarse hair on my chest area.</li>
    <li> This razor is great! Super comfortable to hold and maneuver. The sharp blades combined with the additional moisture strips makes for a great, comfortable, smooth shave that lasts for days. My only complaint is the the position the blades are sitting at makes it extremely easy to cut yourself with even the slightest sideways movement.</li>
    <li> Received this product for free from Gillette. The Gillette Body Razor made it much easier to get all the hard to shave places. The blades were much like other Gillette Razors. They seem like they will last for a few shaving sessions. The thing that really stood out on the cartridge were the three lubricating strips. Normally, razors come with one, maybe two, lubricating strips that tend not to really lubricate while shaving. The lubricating strips on the Gillette Body Razor made my skin feeling refreshed even after the body gel was shaved off. Overall, I will definitely be buying this razor. One extra thing: Not sure if you guys make a Body Razor for females, but I&#x27;m sure it would be a major hit.</li>
    <li> When I received a free package from Gillette to try, and I open it to see how the actual \\&quot;Gillette Razor\\&quot; looks like, I had an instant feeling that this grooming tool was going to be the real deal. Despite the fact that Gillette Razor is made with good quality, it is a beauty that consists attractive colorways to the eyes. It has a nice comfortable grip feeling on the hands, and most importantly, the cartridges are keen sharp, giving it the ability to have a clean and smooth finishing touch after shaving. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Received the Body Razor from Gillette and I must say that I am extremely happy with it. The fact that they actually designed a razor specifically for your body makes me wonder why they didn&#x27;t think of this before. The Sleek Design allows me to hold it without having to do acrobatics trying to smooth some of the hard to reach places ;) The cartridge was great! Left every area it touched feeling smooth and looking as if no hair ever existed.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Body Razor works great! Is shaving made easy. Glides over my thick stubble with ease. Paired up with the Gillette Body Gel, you&#x27;ll be smooth as ice.</li>
    <li> This is great for thick hair! So far I shaved my chest and my armpits. I am amazed at how little irritation there is under my arms. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be irritating when the hair starts to grow back but so far so good. When shaving a little off a little happy trail I was amazed at how well it took off the longer hairs with ease. I have never used a body or a womens razor before but this was by far the best razor I have used for manscaping. Do not recommend using it on your face. It doesn&#x27;t seem to handle the jawline well. I wont deduct points for this because it&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed for. Great product to add to your grooming arsenal!</li>
    <li> Got to try this razor free,This razor seemed to Really work well at first, but dulled out really quickly. I did not shave cleanly for long, and i even managed to nick myself. I would have liked it to stay sharp longer, but since i am a hairy beast, it held out fairly well. i wish this had 5 blades, as i find those seem to work best.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure on using this razor since I am used to a 5 blade razor, but since I had a coupon that was to good to be true I decided to try it. Needless to say I was very impressed that it left my skin smooth, the shave was close.</li>
    <li> Great razor and goes beyond expectations when used with Gillete Body Men&#x27;s Shave Gel.</li>
    <li> I started doing a body shave after losing a bet. Turns out I like the feel. I&#x27;ve tried various ways to get a close shave. Gillette has come up with the best way I&#x27;ve found to date. The head&#x27;s shape helps avoid nicks. The three blade design offers a close, comfortable shave. Give it a try. I think you will be happy.</li>
    <li> Feels like all their other razors. I didn&#x27;t have to spend extra money for this one in particular...</li>
    <li> Being a recreational/club swimmer and cyclist, I shave my legs and underarm hair on occasion to improve my personal best times.  This Gillette Body 3 bladed razor provides smooth and effortless shaves to most regions of the body.  I like the wide and ergonomically contoured handle for grip and control, the rounded cartridge that pivots around various body contours, and the 3 lubricating strips that cause less skin irritation/provides a smooth gliding shaving action.  Shaved hairs rinse out easily from the cartridge.  Like most razors, the initial purchase is affordable, but the replacement blade cartridges can cost a bundle.  I enjoyed using this sample Gillette Body shaver and will continue to use it whenever reasonably priced replacement razor cartridges are available.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Body Razor free from Gillette to review. The only thing I usually shave is my face, but I was willing to give the Gillette Body Razor a shot. Gillette has such a great brand following, and I was confident I would have good results. From first stroke however, I realized this may not be the razor for me. The razor seemed to have to work extra hard (and my hair isn&#x27;t very coarse) and it took multiple strokes to get anywhere. Even with the multiple strokes, I was left with a little more than stubble on my chest. Also, I don&#x27;t usually classify myself as having sensitive skin, but I was left with a slight rash where I had shaved. Even after the initial rash had gone and I tried the razor again, it came back shortly after I was out of the shower. In reference to the razor itself, it has a sharp, bright look to it that is sure to catch the eye of a guy look me looking to try something new. Overall, the experience wasn&#x27;t a bad one, but like I said it took some time actually getting the razor to work. For some this may not be an issue, but I&#x27;m an on-the-go kind of guy and may not be as willing to dedicate so much time.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
    <li> Great to hold. It gives you better control of the razor when used in the shower</li>
    <li> I just used the Gillette Body for the first time, and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll even use it again. It shaved not quite as close as the Pro-Glide Styler and just felt way to flimsy to use on my personal area on a regular basis. Perhaps I will finish the blade off on the chest or legs, but I&#x27;ll keep using slightly used Pro&#x3D;Glide blades for the groin area.&lt;br /&gt;Granted this is the premier edition, but I feel it would be better with more blades and a handle with weight to it. The current handle feels like it should be tossed when the blade dulls. I&#x27;m sure by Super Bowl time they will have a retuned version, but I will not be as quick to purchase next time, I just really wanted to give this a try. I am glad I didn&#x27;t purchase any extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t speak for others, but I do ALL my shaving in the shower, and where else would you use a body razor? It could really use a shower caddy or pod. Something to store it. Or how about jut making a blade system that can be used with the Pro-Glide Styler? I use that on battery power down there anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a myriad of Gillette razors to shave my face and loved them all, so when I started shaving my head this was the razor I went for instead of going with something like the Mach 3 or Fusion. The razor easily gets the spots behind the ears and slightly uneven spots on the top near my crown. It slides really smoothly across my head with no dragging (a task facial razors and the disposable version of this one have failed at). I shave with and then against the grain to get my head and neck as smooth as possible. I normally burn pretty easily and have to use expensive aftershave creams, but this left no burn with no aftershave. Also shaved my chest with no burn (usually get bumps really bad there with any other razor). I haven&#x27;t tried any of the women&#x27;s razors like the Venus, so that may be something to look into. But as far as men&#x27;s razors go this is easily the best for shaving my head and body.</li>
    <li> This works nicely for all the unsightly manly body hairs. The color is ok and it has a nice grip on it. It runs very smoothy and the blads last for a long time. As with most refillable blades, the refill packs are expensive.</li>
    <li> I received the razor from the brand as a free trial.  The Gillette body razor is perfect for shaving the body.  I use this to shave my head and it is one of the best options to do so.  The handle is made of a rubber so it is easy to grip with wet hands.  Shaved hair washes easily away from the cartridge, and clean up takes just a few seconds.  The rubber handle makes this the perfect shaving system to use in the shower.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about losing grip and cutting yourself or dropping the razor.  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> Received the Body Razor from Gillette and I must say that I am extremely happy with it. This is the first time I have successfully shaved my chest without cutting it at all. I don&#x27;t have to shake out the blades as much as I would a regular razor and it was getting everything in one swipe.

I will be sticking with this in the future.</li>
    <li> same as women&#x27;s version just in green.  It does clog up easily.  No worries about cutting yourself.  I recommend this as a touchup from using nair or other means.</li>
    <li> Well, I have spent the last week testing the this product from Gillette and I cannot begin to describe how versatile it really is. Compared to the rough cutting disposable razors I have purchased in the past, this thing is far superior in its blade design, ergonomics and grip. The handle design is quite good, the grip while wet is still easy to control--unlike disposables which tend to slip from my hands. From an aesthetics stand point, the razor is decent enough looking, it&#x27;s not too different than other brands and the color combo seems to be following the current trends.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the real deal engineered part that actually makes all the difference-the blades and soft gel pads. This combination allows the ability to use it on my face and body without having to have two specialized razors, which is a big plus. To me the head design looks like a women&#x27;s razor in shape and layout, I have yet to set it side by side my fiance&#x27;s razor but eh close enough. Having only 3 blades made me slightly worried, as my normal razor has 4, but I was worried for nothing. It cut really well and left smooth skin without irritation. The gel pads seem adequate, but I have a feeling they won&#x27;t last as long as the blades will. Now, for the single downside I can find with this razor--it needs a trim blade located on the head like the other men&#x27;s Gillette razors for hard to reach areas and to complete it versatility of use for your face and body.</li>
    <li> I received this free shaver from Gillette and really enjoy it. It&#x27;s shaves nicely. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a buy. I was able to use it first time with no hassle. Dropped it multiple times and still works like new</li>
    <li> I loved the overall look and feel of the razor I received from Gillette but it was a miss in my book. The handle was easy to grip and left me with smooth skin but it was only good for one use.</li>
    <li> I’m not big in shaving other parts of my body, but wanted to try this razor.  Shaped differently than your usual razor, it has a movable heard that travels the contours of your body for a smooth shave. I had no problems with it and it left no nicks on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better disposable razors I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s sharp but safe, holds it&#x27;s edge for a good amount of time and does everything it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I can&#x27;t give it five stars because it&#x27;s only marketed to men. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; razor. Hello, it&#x27;s 2014: 1914 wants it&#x27;s sexist marketing ploys back. Seriously. Why gender market something like this. It&#x27;s a body razor. Women need body razors. Marketing to one segment of the sexes is short sighted and insulting.</li>
    <li> Same as women&#x27;s only with a more manly look. The blades are different than the great Mach 3 in that they are spaced out to allow for more thick and longer hair not to clog the shaver and pull on your various non face skin parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does accomplish this task to an acceptable degree. If shaving for first time in an area, go slow as it will clog and you don&#x27;t want any hang ups or yanking trust me. After your first shave of the new area has been done, there should not be any issues in speeding things up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this systems quality is no where near the Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s, while costing basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels like a cheap piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;That aside it functions as needed with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now then, you should be aware of this little tidbit of info. Gillette has a new Venus Embrace women&#x27;s shaver that is better than the original Venus as well as this one. It has five spaced further blades and makes your first time shave much safer with so much more blade surface it is less likely to clog or hang up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Venus-Embrace-Cartridges-Showerpod/dp/B000XVSNTQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice...pass on this shaver and get the women&#x27;s Venus Embrace. It&#x27;s not about the color, it&#x27;s about the quality of the shave..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> No matter how much a company wants to throw at you that their razor is better just because its their newest product, we all know in the shaving world that more blades &#x3D; more effiency. The different often times between men and women products (especially razors) tent to be color patterns). I wish that Gillette will sell 5 blades instead of 3 like the Gillette Venus Embrace. No one wants to do their &amp;#34;manscapping&amp;#34; going over the same area over and over again (though trimming helps prevent less hair stuck in the blade, we are all guilty of not trimming beforehand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, the razor is best in the shower, and it does kind of feel a bit cheap in the hands (like plastic cheap). As you go through your areas, you do have to knock the blade against your shower tub/wall to get rid of the hair that sometimes gets stuck in between the blades. There is a lubrication strip on the razor&#x27;s head and that does help with the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t really care about packaging&#x27;s name, I recommend buying the Gillette Venus Embrace in green. Green is overall a gender-neutral color and it gives you more bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate that in the description it says &amp;#34;Less feel of irritation (vs. Gillette Sensor 2 Plus disposable)&amp;#34;. Gillette Sensor 2 is a 2 blade razor made in the 90&#x27;s. There have been many innovations made since then, and its about time that Gillette offers a 5 blade razor for men. til then, this its an okay/average razor.</li>
    <li> Check out the pictures as I&#x27;ve uploaded a few of the Body Razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a shot because I am pretty adamant about upkeep, if you get my meaning. I&#x27;ve tried many, many razors over the years, so I&#x27;m well versed when it comes to what makes a good body grooming razor. This razor does a pretty good job, and in some respects is better than others, but overall there are other cartridges that I felt worked a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first of all, if you have ever used a Gillette Venus, the handle on this razor is exactly the same. The only differences are the handles says Gillette instead of Venus, and the colors on this one are geared towards men - being a cool green and black combination. The Venus is definitely colored to appeal to women, being pink and other pastel colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a re-titled Venus is not a bad thing at all. I used Venus razors almost exclusively for probably the past 5 or more years. Ergonomically they are great, and the non-slip rubber grip that&#x27;s molded around the plastic handle ensures that you won&#x27;t drop it very often. I can&#x27;t say for certain, and maybe it&#x27;s just because the Gillette is so new, but comparing it to the Venus I could swear the Gillette was more tacky feeling, and I felt like it was easier to hold onto because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So really, what this razor boils down to is the cartridge. This cartridge has a few lubricant strips on it; three to be exact. Two above the razor blades, and one below it. The idea here is that a little lube will assist the razor in gliding over your skin to help reduce razor burn. That&#x27;s all well and good, but the strips are very small, and don&#x27;t have a lot of lube on it. You might get two uses out of it in the shower, and then the lube is completely gone. Not an issue if you use shaving cream or something else to ease the friction, but thought it was worth a mention, especially when you contrast it with the Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venus is a night and day difference in the lube department. The cartridge is literally encased in very wide lubricant blocks - not strips. When the razor hits water, the lube turns into this slippery, slimy stuff and you definitely do not have to worry about friction! They also last a heck of a lot longer than the Gillette Body Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that said - there are drawbacks. The difference in size between the Body Razor and the Venus means that trying to get into... uhm, tight spaces is VERY difficult with a Venus, because the size is so much bigger. The Body Razor, on the other hand, fits almost anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that the Body Razor is a bit easier to clean, since it&#x27;s not surrounded by a huge lube block like the Venus is. Rinsing it out under a shower clears away any stuff that&#x27;s on the blades easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that sums it up. The Body Razor is pretty good, it&#x27;s just lacking in the lube department. If you don&#x27;t have a razor for this type of work, then this is a good choice. I&#x27;ll keep using the handle, but when the cartridge wears out I&#x27;ll probably just stick to Venus cartridges. The lube on that has really spoiled me.be department.

    <li> i received a free sample from the brand. I want to commend Gillette for another excellent razor. This one makes it easy to shave virtually any part of your body with ease and less irritation. The pivoting head adapts to body contours. Only dislike is that blades went dull after only 3 shaves but I am use to this with multiple other products that I use for saving.</li>
    <li> My brother received this Gillette razor and he loved it! He strongly recommends this product. A great smooth shave and  no irritation.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from Gillette and was pleasantly surprised. Gets such a smooth shave. It&#x27;s one razor I can say I would buy if I saw it. The handle is great, the heads nice and large. Great design and it also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette as a free sample. I used it out and it got right in those hard to reach spaces. Made for a nice smooth shave and I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great results, smooth and safe. Usually no razor bumps or itching either. Just don&#x27;t lie it on the blade side down it can stick and damage. Also a wash cloth to wipe off the excess hair can help too as your shaving.</li>
    <li> with the razors they have no days, its hard to point out the right kind of razor for each person. after using this uniquely designed razor with plastic grip and ultra versatile design- no complaints. gifted as it guided through each strand of hair without persecuting and dividing the hairs into and slicing without a nudge. amazed as i one evenhandedly steadied the blade along my neck and body pursuing each tantalizing hair after another.as it had been done before but not like this. it was amazing. now breathless ended the razors wielding for another day.</li>
    <li> I normally use an old school double edge Merkur razor on my face.  This was a great big reminder of why I prefer that system to these modern razors.  The blades are expensive on this thing, and are so dull I cannot believe it.  I simply wanted to clear out some excess underarm hair, and the number of passes I had to make was so excessive I eventually threw the thing in the trash and pulled out my Merkur.  What a ripoff!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the 3 blades. I rather use the regular 4 or five blade.</li>
    <li> used to use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo until I was able to try the Gillette Body Razor out as a free sample from Gillette, but now I&#x27;ll be switching to the Body Razor completely. The handle has a great grip and has just the right amount of flexibility (it&#x27;s not rigid). I like the thumb grip too which makes it easy to control where the razor is. Even the cartridge is smooth and cuts effortlessly. My skin felt great after using the razor, even after trying a quick shave with just water. It&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try a sample of this free from Gillette and over all it gave a pretty decent shave. The handle was pretty standard but a little on the light side for me. I personally prefer something a little heavier like my mach 3. The plus side to the handle was the material gave a nice grip so there weren&#x27;t any accidents. I do wish it offered the cartridge a little bit more maneuverability. When it comes to grooming I really want a razor that will move with the terrain a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge itself wasn&#x27;t anything special. My wife has nicer cartridges on her Venus razor to be honest. This cartridge got really clogged up the first once over. I would suggest trimming down and then using this to finish up. It not really strong enough to take care of everything by itself. Like I said pretty decent razor but nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t get this one again personally.</li>
    <li> This was a decent razor. I like how smooth it made my skin feel. It made manscaping pretty easy. Only negative was it clogged pretty easy. But once I washed it with water, it came off for the most part.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure on using this razor since I am used to a 5 blade razor, but since Gillette sent me a free sample of the Gillette Body Razor I thought that I would try it since I ran out of razor blades for my current razor. The first time I used it I was very impressed that it left my skin smooth, the shave was close.  However, that was just the first time. It seems as this razor is meant to be a disposable since the second time I tried using it the blades were dull and I did not get as close as a shave as I did the first time, I did for someone reason try it a third time and that was the last time I used it, I threw it away.  The third time using it the smoothing strips came off, the blade was extremely dull, I ended up having to go to the store and by replacement blades for my original razor and shave again. I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette body razor for a few weeks now and I will not go ack to another razor. I shave my head every morining and the shave is so close I&#x27;ve been asked if I wax my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is very light and moves easily across your skin. I have yet to get razor burn or a cut. And because I shave my head, everyone knows when you cut yourself. I&#x27;ve raved about the razor at work with a few other member of the bald club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going back to another razor, the body razor is it for me.</li>
    <li> The razor worked really well and have a close shave over all it worked really nicely</li>
    <li> Better get a mechanical body shaver like Philipps where there&#x27;s no irritation, this is underwhelming.</li>
    <li> I recently got the chance to try out the Gillette Body razor through a trial from Gillette. I have tried at least a handful of \\&quot;so-called\\&quot; full body razors at one time or another and few have provided the confidence in shaving that the Gillette Body razor does.  A lot of times one nick is enough to ruin a grooming routine.  The caveat being as with most razors if you do not regularly use the product things and can become a bit \\&quot;harry\\&quot; pun intended as you will often find yourself rinsing the razor constantly to ensure effectiveness.  Beyond what should be considered an obvious caveat to any shaving expedition the razor worked quite well.  A few passes and I was pleased with the results.  The Gillette body shave gel also keeps things moving smoothly. What can sometimes be described as a painful/ irritant filled experience was avoided with the cool refreshing gel.  Ultimately the selling point for me was the lack of any nicks or irritation throughout use.  What has in the past lead to an occasional affair now has the potential to be a part of my daily routine, especially being able to shave in confidence!</li>
    <li> Razor left me with bumps and ingrown hairs all over the place. Had to stop using after my skin started to get infected. Not happy. It did remind me why I never remove body hair though.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  works great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work better than my standard Gillette razor but it&#x27;s better than a single blade.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I like this better than the Mach 3 or Fusion for the body. Does a really nice job for man grooming the main man area down there and even that other area that you can&#x27;t see without a mirror....yeah that one lol. I feel confident that it will not cut me if I don&#x27;t get really careless. I have not used up a blade yet so I cannot comment on longevity of that.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Easier to use than a standard razor. Great purchase if you just want to check if it&#x27;s for you. My next purchase will be the one with the replaceable heads</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Gillette Venus reimagined in masculine colors. It gets the job done.</li>
