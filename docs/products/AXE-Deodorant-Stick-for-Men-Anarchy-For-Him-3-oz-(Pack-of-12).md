    <li> Although Axe&#x27;s lead product is the fragranced aerosol deodorant body spray, other formats of the brand exist. Within underarm care the following are available: deodorant aerosol body spray, deodorant stick, deodorant roll-on, anti-perspirant aerosol spray (called Axe Dry), and anti-perspirant stick (also called Axe Dry).</li>
    <li> It smells good and came within the time frame given.</li>
    <li> I stunk by the end of the day. Got out a different brand and used it. Not me. this awful product. Remove or reformulate. This is a loser.</li>
    <li> Axe Deodorant Stick with a usual pleasant smell. After small physical activity of an armpit become wet, but don&#x27;t smell. Next time I won&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Son loves this everything Axe - gifted it to him - with a few other Axe products, Amazon is competitive with Wal-Mart in price - when purchasing the amount (now $35) to get free S/H - this is a great deal.</li>

    <li> Love the new scent this is one of the best deoderants that i have tried in years glad they made the apollo into a deoderant</li>
    <li> Product as described, shipped ini timely matter</li>
    <li> Got here fast smells good and keeps me from stinkin&#x27;..Next time though I think I won&#x27;t get the Apollo type, cause I hate waiting for the countdown before I can raise the product from the tube..</li>
    <li> Only use this deodorant. Love it&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff, it&#x27;s strong, has a strong smell. It covers up the stank when I do the dirty which I don&#x27;t like, I like the stank it makes me feel stanky and I like that</li>
    <li> My top favorite scent. Took me a while to find a deodorant that would work. This product works like a charm I no longer suffer from bad odder from the pits.</li>
    <li> Great scent and did not have anti-perspiration component which is why I wanted it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. Fits nicely on the shelf.</li>

    <li> Does it&#x27;s job, smells nice...but it leaves a white streak.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Axe fragrance, and I&#x27;ve completely committed. Between the shampoo, deodorant, and body spray, I feel that I really own this scent. This Deoderant works well. I don&#x27;t consider myself a heavy sweater by no means, so someone that is may or may not experience a difference, but it works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> It does the job and I love the fragrance</li>
    <li> I smell great when I don&#x27;t stink.</li>
