<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo to use.  Smells so much better than the other brands.</li>
    <li> Used this for pityrosporum folliculitis. Worked great, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have dandruff, and this stuff really takes care of it.  I notice within days if I haven&#x27;t used something like this, and of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s expensive.  I don&#x27;t like having to buy it so often at this price, but I hate having dandruff even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that works, then this is your thing.  If you don&#x27;t need something this strong you might look into one of the cheaper alternatives. They work, just not as well, but they are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY thing that works for my daughter.  With the little brush thingy and Nizoral, flakes are gone as long as she does it right.  Teenagers!</li>
    <li> No difference and very expensive</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and I noticed a a change... My scalp is getting healthier</li>
    <li> I think some hair is growing back in my thinning spot.</li>
    <li> three steps to hair growth.  someone on these reviews posted the following and my bald spot is almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;1. leave this shampoo on for thirty monutes three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;2. take a biotine pill once a day&lt;br /&gt;3. use minoxidal as directed&lt;br /&gt;its working for me</li>
    <li> One of the best for seborrhea of the scalp as well as a fair amount of research&lt;br /&gt;on it&#x27;s benefit to slow hair loss. Ketoconizole apparently interferes with the receptors&lt;br /&gt;in the follicle that involve testosterone uptake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An the price was the best available as well.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders, salicylic acid, coal tar...you name it - didn&#x27;t work well for my scaly scalp issues. This Nizoral works wonders for me. It lathers well, no harsh odor. This is the non-prescription strength version. I use it consistently for 3 times per week and it has kept my scalp clear - I can wear black again!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get rid of dandruff, itchy scalp, giant flakes etc.  homeopathic remedies like apple cider vinegar, listerine, coconut oil didn&#x27;t do a thing.  This stuff worked!!</li>
    <li> I use this to make my hair thicker. (Once a week and I let the suds sit on my head for about 10 minutes). I have read that the antifungal keeps the fungus that chokes the hair follicles from causing hair loss. Seems to work and slowing hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells pretty great. Good price. A bit drying, of course.</li>
    <li> This is not the same Nizoral shampoo that I remember. I dunno if it&#x27;s me or a change in the ingredients but I&#x27;ve found it to be not as effective as it used to be. I find myself looking to other shampoos to control my dandruff. I remember a period when it was almost impossible to find this shampoo...maybe a couple years? But now it&#x27;s back and just not the same. Sadly, this will probably be the last time I purchase this rather expensive shampoo.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Definitely helped me get rid of dandruff, flaking and itching.</li>
    <li> Great product, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and about five years ago I found out that I had extremely low testosterone so I had to begin testosterone replacement therapy.  My hair almost immediately began to thin and I had the beginnings of a bald spot.  I had read that this shampoo helped with thinning hair so I bought it and have used it for the last 4-5 months.  My hair has thickened and the bald spot has begun growing back.  I have not done anything else besides using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the shampoo smells good.  When I first started using it, I would let it sit in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing so it would be more effective.  Now I just use it like regular shampoo and I&#x27;m still getting great results.</li>
    <li> My head no longer resembles the wintry snow capped mountains of middle earth. Although, it could be related to the melting polar caps due to global warming...should investigate further.</li>
    <li> Yes. This is a great product and definitely gets the job done. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tried everything before this. Could not get my flaking under control. After using daily for 3 weeks, my skin was clear. The redness, flaking, and itching was gone. I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> One of the best dandruff shampoo on the market.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> After using this product 2 times I noticed a huge difference in my hair. Less itchy, no flakes and feeling great.  I couldn&#x27;t get my doctor to prescribe this to me so I found it online and purchased myself, best money ever spent.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast delivery. This is by far the best anti-dandruff shampoo you can get without a prescription. Been using for years.</li>
    <li> it serves what it suppose to except my hubby needed a stronger one (like 2%) for his problem</li>
    <li> Bought it for someone in the family. Quite effective.</li>
    <li> Using it for long time and great for dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with awful dandruff. Finally found this stuff. Used it with tree oil and no more dandruff! And trust me I had tried EVERYTHING. This stuff works.</li>
    <li> I have had itchy and flaky scalp issues for  well over thirty years! I have used various dandruff shampoos during this time, and never had much relief from this chronic problem. After watching an episode of  Dr. Oz I learned that dandruff comes from fungus eating the oil on the scalp, so you need an antifungal product to kill it (never knew that ). I then googled best rated anti fungal shampoos online and Nizoral AD had great reviews. I went to my go to place, Amazon and read the more  reviews and thought I would try it. I ordered nizoral hoping I wouldn&#x27;t hate it, and wasn&#x27;t going to have to spend more money on a useless product.  Well, I waited several months to write my review because I wanted to try the product for several months so that I can give an accurate assessment.  Based on the directions and other reviews, I decided to use it about twice a week and leave it on my scalp and hair for five minutes.  I wash my hair everyday and use a moisturizing shampoo in between using nizoral.  I also use a lot of conditioner on the days I use nizoral. I have color treated hair and didn&#x27;t want too much dryness or color fading. I am thrilled with the results. I have noticed at least an eighty percent improvement in itching and flaking and my scalp feels much cleaner and less oily.  My hair feels clean, but not totally fried, dried or stripped. also I do not have bad hair days when I use it like other dandruff shampoos. It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and my hair isn&#x27;t totally unmanageable after using it too. Some dandruff shampoos make my scalp sore,  but  this does not!  I really wish I knew about this product years ago, but I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that truly works and doesn&#x27;t ravage my hair, smell bad, or strip color in the process.  I also have been noticing less hair loss since using NIzoral a.d.  I have been using rogaine for the past few years, and notice even less hair loss since using this shampoo. Rogaine tends to make your scalp a bit flakier because of thealcohol in it, so this shampoo has been a life saver.  I have had great results for the past few months using this product, and will continue to use this as long as they make it and sell it! Please do not change this product or stop selling this. the price is a bit high, but well worth every penny to me because it works!</li>
    <li> Used Head and Shoulders anti dandruff shmapoo for ~5 years (twice a week) and didn&#x27;t notice much difference. Bought this product based on the reviews here and noticed significant difference in 2 weeks and now after a month its dandruff free! Thank you all for the reviews.</li>
    <li> Great product got my flakes to go away!</li>
    <li> Works really well but can be a bit drying!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This product has been a life saver.  I had what was kind of a acne breakout on my head and nothing seemed to work until I found this.  It is very calming and has even made my hair grow faster.  Love.</li>
    <li> Works well for colored hair</li>
    <li> A good product at a good price. It works fine for me and has a great smell. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The best dandruff shampoo my husband uses. This is the only one he sees the results.</li>
    <li> very good shampoo for dandruff! my mother loves it!</li>
    <li> All this items are wonderful</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works and how quickly. After only 1 use, I noticed improvements. And after a few weeks, my dandruff was gone. I wonder if dermatologists and Proctor &amp; Gamble are in a conspiracy to hide this stuff. Try it - you will love it.</li>
    <li> Eh. I think I prefer the CVS brand instead. This is overpriced and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that works for me. If other products don&#x27;t get rid of flakes, try this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and the shipping speed was good.</li>
    <li> This formula lathers very well, and seems to be helping with hair loss, as I notice a lot less hair on my brush lately. The scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, however there was a problem with my order. I ordered only 1 however I was charged for 4 shampoos. Not sure if I will get the refund.</li>
    <li> Cleared that rash right up</li>
    <li> It was okay, did not help as much as I had hoped for</li>
    <li> Works wonders,  I only need to use once a week to have no flakes, or redness.  Was miserable before I found this.</li>
    <li> Only product that works on keeping my kiddie&#x27;s dandruff under control.  The best deal I&#x27;ve found on the internet lately. Can&#x27;t be bought in stores around my area.</li>
    <li> so far, so good.  this is my second run on this product after using Regenepure (which didn&#x27;t work for me).</li>
    <li> This product has half the active ingredient of the prescription product.  However it still works great to control head fungus and dandruff caused by fungus.  It can be used daily without negative effects.  I love being able to buy the product I need without paying a doctor $100 for a visit.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pleasant-smelling and gentle on my hair. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I think I could without concern.  While this hasn&#x27;t completely cured my problem, this is the first time in more than 20 years that I&#x27;ve gotten any relief from the itching and flaking! I hope that with continued use, my dandruff will go away completely. --------------- **UPDATE** I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 months now and while my dandruff is not 100% cured, I will have to say that it&#x27;s been reduced by about 75% to 80%. Flaking is very minimal--to what I would consider a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; range. I no longer worry about errant flakes falling on my dark-colored clothes! I have certain problem areas on my scalp that will still flake, but it now takes weeks for those areas to flare up, rather than the three/four-day flare-ups that I used to have. I am so happy with this product that it is now part of my regular shampoo routine.</li>
    <li> Ok, but get the Prescription 2%&lt;br /&gt;It ALOTTTTT!!!! Better.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re losing your hair, you should be using this.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dandruff for years and have tried most of the store brand stuff but to no avail. It wasn&#x27;t until my barber started recommending i try certain products that i knew i had to try something different.I researched and stumbled across Nizoral with several people swearing by it. At $15 for only 7 ounces i wasn&#x27;t to thrilled at the price but i decided what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i got it in i was worried it would smell a little funky but it actually has a nice smell to it. I tried it and used it 3 days a week and have noticed a dramatic improvement. Ive had it for a few months now and am a bit surpised that its lasted so long.</li>
    <li> Im suffering from diffuse thinning and I can say Ive seen good/great results just from using this shampoo for 2 months now. Stepping out of the shower used to be a drag for me because I hated seeing my scalp through my hair in the mirror. 2 months have gone by now and it looks like my hair is starting to fill in. You should follow the instructions carefully if you are experiencing hairloss. Here is my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it twice a week. Monday and Thursday. When I use it, the 1st thing I do when I step in the shower is apply this shampoo and leave it on for 10-15. Create a good strong lather in your head with a drop as big as a quarter or nickel and leave it on your head for 10-15 mins. Do what you have to do in the shower but make sure it stays on 10-15 mins in your head and wrinsing it off should be the last thing you do in the shower before you step out. Follow those instruction and watch your head new hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for men with early signs of male pattern baldness. If you are already in the mid stages or late stages then I cant say you will see the same results.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best available.  I had huge dandruff problem, scalp was flaking and peeling severely.  I had dry skin flaking and pealing from my eyebrows and even gotee.  It was embarrassing and non stop no matter what I tried.  I started using this and ALL my problems are gone, like magic.  I cannot believe how well this stuff works.  AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Got rid of skin rash/fungus after a couple washes on the chest and stomach.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really helpful to reduce the dandruff, fast and efficient, after used for the couple times you will know the difference, great product for someone has the dandruff problem!</li>
    <li> USE IT REGULARLY DOES A GOOD JOB.</li>
    <li> Only antidandruff shampoo that works for my husband. Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that helps with the itching from my psoriasis on my scalp!</li>
    <li> it is great. really work</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! I tried everything before it.... In about a week I was dandruff free :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old male, and have suffered from chronic dandruff since I was a teenager. I&#x27;m not the kind of person who likes to use super chemical-laden shampoos, but I&#x27;ve literally tried everything to get relief from it. I&#x27;ve used Selsun Blu, T-Gel, and Head &amp; Shoulders with little to no luck. I&#x27;ve even washed my hair with raw cider vinegar and olive oil (I don&#x27;t recommend), and used 100% organic shampoos to no avail. Head &amp; Shoulders was the only one that sort of worked, but it never actually completely got rid of the dandruff for me. After trying Nizoral, I wish I&#x27;d heard of the stuff years ago (or at least noticed its inconspicuous presence on the store shelf in the &amp;#34;anti-dandruff&amp;#34; shampoo section).  While I don&#x27;t find dandruff to be an embarrassing condition per se, I do find it incredibly annoying and uncomfortable. I would have it all year round to varying degrees, sometimes so badly that I could literally peel thick layers of flaking skin off of my scalp just by scratching it; this was accompanied by incessant sores and redness.  Turns out after a little research that I actually was suffering from seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp, which isn&#x27;t the same thing as seasonal dandruff caused by dry skin. Nizoral works to fight this with the ingredient ketoconazole, which destroys the overabundance of yeast fungi that naturally live on the scalp. In people who suffer from seborrhoeic dermatitis-caused dandruff, the overabundance of yeast irritates the scalp, causing a rapid turnover in cell production, and thus, incessant flaking and peeling of the skin.  The bottle of Nizoral indicates to use every 3-4 days until the condition subsides, and then use weekly. I used it two days in a row because my condition was so bad, and on the second day I noticed an extreme difference in my scalp. I could scratch my head like crazy, brush my hair, and no dandruff! Normally, I&#x27;d be able to cause a snowstorm by just scratching my head (seriously, the amount of dandruff flakes that I could send cascading off my scalp was absurd). Not only that, but the itchiness and the sores on my scalp disappeared.  It was honestly a miracle using this stuff. I have been using it 1-2 times a week between shampooing with my regular shampoo, and my dandruff has literally disappeared. The only downside is the shampoo is a bit drying on the hair, so I&#x27;d recommend using a conditioner after shampooing with it. I usually wash it in and leave it on my scalp for a couple of minutes in the shower just to make sure it&#x27;s actually penetrating to the skin.  The shampoo is a bit expensive, costing around $17 for a 7 ounce bottle store-price, but a little of it goes a long way, and it&#x27;s honestly worth the money. If you&#x27;ve tried all the other shampoos on the market with no luck, chances are you don&#x27;t have just regular dandruff, and so far Nizoral is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve used that has actually completely gotten rid of the condition for me— and ever am I thankful!</li>
    <li> I was so tired of the white flakes on my shoulders and decide to give Nizoral a try. It is the best!</li>
    <li> Fast results. This will leave your head dry. Recommend drops of natural oils after use.</li>
    <li> The best thing on the market for my flaky hair! As long as I use this shampoo my scalp is beautifully flake- free. It does not smell bad like some of the &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; products do. The value was good for me as the only place I have found this locally is several dollars higher. Try it, you will be happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;m not impressed. Seems to make my scalp itch and burn after use. Also, it seems to be hastening a receding hairline.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works very well</li>
    <li> very pleased with the product. Seller  excelled as well.</li>
    <li> Works great for itching and dandruff reducer. Just that it doesn&#x27;t really stop hair fall.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for receding hairline.</li>
    <li> Been fighting dandruff with one of the kids for sometime. The usual brands that contain pyrithione zinc never really helped. This helped a lot. At first I thought it was too expensive (still think it&#x27;s pricey) but they recommend using this only a few times a week so it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great.  I suffered for years with this problem and this is the only thing that helped.  One thing i want to point out is that I did some research because I was a little put off that my head problem was caused by a fungus.  I know that my problem was a fungus because this shampoo treats scalp fungus and it&#x27;s the only one that worked.  I changed my diet and eliminated sugar and saw a direct relation.  Since then, I began an anti-fungal supplement called GB-3 made by a company called Endo-Met, and although I still keep this shampoo - I don&#x27;t seem to need it anymore since taking that supplement.  I do eat sugar again but not as recklessly as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is just because I wanted to urge you to consider treating the source of the problem rather than just a symptom of it.  In my case, it worked out really, really well to do my homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shampoo though - took about 4 days for it to really make a night and day difference.  I was able to wear black again.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be no better or no worse than any other available at the local department store.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the only medicated antidandruff shampoo that keeps my dandruff and scaly scalp under control.  It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been buying it for years</li>
    <li> Expensive but good.  Been using for maybe 10 years two or three times a week.  Still have hair (47 yr old male) and wards off dandruff.  Don&#x27;t get in your eye though!</li>
    <li> product is great the amazon shipping took 2-3 weeks</li>
    <li> Works great! Much better than H&amp;S. I&#x27;ll be buying more when this run out.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has ever helped with my sons itchy, flaky and sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful &amp; FAST working product, highly recommended</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS FAIR!</li>
    <li> I have experienced dry, itchy scalp since early adulthood. It is a family trait that has been described as seborrheic dermatitis.  I have used all types of solutions and never been able to keep it under control.  Even a prescription, topical steroid struggled to keep it at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Nizoral.  I am now using it in a rotating manner with Tar Gel, Selenium Sulfide, and Pyrithione Zinc.  The active ingredient in Nizoral is Ketoconazole which is typically used for fungal infections.  I am not certain if fungus is at the root, but it is a potential in that all of the other shampoos and steroids could lead to reduced bacterial growth (a natural antifungal).  As seborrheic dermatitis is caused by irritation, there are many, many sources from perfumes, oils (natural body oils in addition to those in hair products), etc.  I don&#x27;t know the specific source, but can say that adding Nizoral to the mix quickly reduce or eliminated the problems with my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you have dandruff...</li>
    <li> I have a horse that is always scratching his neck &amp; tail tail, breaking off his mane and tail hair, due to dandruff.  This shampoo was recommended to me by my Veterinarian as being &amp;#34;one of the best dandruff shampoos on the market.&amp;#34;  I have used it on my horse 3 times and so far, he is not scratching his neck &amp; tail like before.  I am going to keep using it and hoping that he clears his dandruff up entirely.</li>
    <li> as advertised i am dandruff free, though it can dry out your hair and scalp and cause some itchiness</li>
    <li> Wife worried about thinning hair so purchased this along with some other vitamins and essential oils. Gave it 3 stars only because do not know if it actually works for hair loss, Will update rating as we go along.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while and this is the best place to buy it. It is a couple of dollars more at pharmacies and such.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works great. I have issues with scalp dryness, but using Nizoral has helped to alleviate these problems. I use it once or twice a week as needed and it clears everything right up.</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps relieve itching on body, and not only the dandruff on your head for certain skin conditions.  A less expensive alternative to the prescription Nizoral.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to. Have to use it every 3-4 days for a few weeks to feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product will for everyone  but by the second application of nizoral I was dandruff free!  It&#x27;s been three weeks since I started using it and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a good pack, considering how I use this everyday. Don&#x27;t want to run out of this!</li>
    <li> It cleared up my dandruff after the 3rd use.</li>
    <li> Great product keeps my scalp dandruff free and makes my hair soft and manageable! Love it!</li>
    <li> It works! After about 2 weeks and 4-5 washes, dandruff was pretty much under control. It beats the blue stuff hands down. Don&#x27;t waste your money on head and shoulder either.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working after using Head and Shoulders, Glovers, Tea Tree Oil, and other dandruff shampoos.  A little on the pricey side though.</li>
    <li> I read that some people used this product in addition to Rogaine for hair regrowth.  I was balding on the top of my head (like some monk hair cuts) but wanted to try something before going hardcore Rogaine.  Within a month I started noticing a huge difference and though the spot is still thin, I no longer have a bald spot on my head :D :D :D :D</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I can&#x27;t say it will cure everyone&#x27;s dandruff--it has cleared all of my dandruff away, but not my wife&#x27;s. She has always had very serious dandruff protected by her thick and luxurious hair, and nothing yet has removed it all, though this has helped. Regardless of that, it does help a lot with itching and irritation.</li>
    <li> Works perfect...a perfect solution for the dandruff...no doubt.</li>
    <li> it does what it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great product, totally eliminated dandruff, with just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Does better than the prescription that costa 6x as much.</li>
    <li> I have had tinnia versicolor for about 15 years and this is the only topical treatment I&#x27;ve had major success with. I use it primarily as a bodywash and let it sit for a minute or two before rinsing off. At first, I&#x27;ll use it every shower for a week and that usually fades the tinnia drastically.  Then I&#x27;ll use it once or twice a week to maintain. Without it, it takes about 2-3 weeks for my tinnia to come back fully,  depending on the season. I also occasionally use it for dandruff but prefer Denorex. One bottle lasts me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Solved my dandruff problems after 2 weeks (4 uses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had dandruff problems for over 10 years, usually whenever I am going through any stressful situation, aka exams, deadlines, and so on, it gets really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this shampoo as instructed, twice a week, after the second week, magic! No trace of dandruff, and I am going through some very stressful situations that in other times, would ve made my head look like a Christmas tale..</li>
    <li> The hair is still oily but is has good shape</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best for dandruff. I was having a really rough time and even head and shoulders couldn&#x27;t help but this did the trick.</li>
    <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that gets rid of my 2 teenage boys hair!!! And that is saying something! I&#x27;ve tried all the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brands even t gel by neutragena. This works!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used, and works EXTREMLY good!!!!!! I will order it again, but it does not ship outside of the U.S.A.  (APO  address).</li>
    <li> Really happy that this shampoo is back in stock again. Most effective solution I have found for seborrhea.</li>
    <li> ONLY dandruff shampoo that works on my daughters hair. Highly recommended but sometimes the price gets crazy on here. You can get it for $8-13 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> On my 2nd bottle and love the way it works and smells - try it!</li>
    <li> In my experience, the best way to treat and minimize psoriasis is using Coal Tar twice a week and Nizoral once a week. When I first started using Nizoral, I found that it worked, but then gradually my psoriasis returned I think due to the fungus developing an immunity to the ketoconazole. When I tried coal tar by itself, I found it helped decrease the psoriasis somewhat, but frequent use was harsh on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thereafter, I tried using Coal Tar on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then Nizoral on Saturday. I found this schedule to best treat my psoriasis problem. I&#x27;ve been doing this for the past 18 months with very good results. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore and I don&#x27;t flake off scales of dead, dry skin anymore, after having this problem for nearly 20 years since puberty. There is still a little flaking, but my psoriasis symptoms are 90% reduced, which is a result that I am happy with.</li>
    <li> For stubborn cases of dandruff, nothing has worked for me better than this stuff. Was unavailable for a while but is back now, and I&#x27;m able to get it through Amazon for less than my local pharmacy price.</li>
    <li> The only product I could find that would take care of my itchy, dry scalp. Head and Shoulders, Selsun, etc all failed after a time. Been using this for a few years now and have been dandruff and dry-scalp free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of your who purchase it: I found it always worked best to use it every other day for the first week or two, then drop back to once or twice a week. Once it &#x27;clears&#x27; the scalp, you don&#x27;t need it very often. Once you stop using it, can take 3 - 4 weeks to start having issues again (ran out a couple times and noticed this before I&#x27;d get more.)</li>
    <li> I have dandruff (severe), the flaking.... the itching. I went to get my hair cut and the stylist said I also have dry scalp. I kid you not I tried everything. Head &amp; Shoulders does not work and I stopped using that 7-10 years ago. I also tried other expensive dandruff shampoo, surely the itching and flaking stops for a day and comes back the next. I also tried the herbal remedy, organic remedy. The lemon and apple cider. I was desperate!&lt;br /&gt;Till I found this in Amazon. Read the reviews and it sounded promising so why not?! Click to &#x27;BUY&#x27;!!! Some people say its different now and some say it does not work. Well, the first time I tried it, it was eehh... I looked in my scalp and still seen some snow flakes everywhere. No itch tho. 2nd day of trying it looked into the mirror and seen minimal flakes big and small; I was going to work that day so I had to blow dry my hair for the flakes to fall off! Yes it was sooooo bad. Anyhow, 3rd time using it was tottaly different. Looked into the mirror and I find NOTHING. I air dried my hair, which I dont do cuz flakes would dry with it and my head would look like hair balls with rice stuck in it. In this case my hair was free with flakes!!! Not itchy!!!! I am happy to say that I am dandruff free! Itch free! My scalp is better &amp; not dry. These fungi just disapeared!</li>
    <li> I gave 2 stars because it really sucks for me. It made my scalp so much worse that now I have to go see a doctor for it when it really wasn&#x27;t that bad before. However, my 2 sisters tried it as well, and for some reason it worked for them. So I guess it works, but not on some people. Just be careful when you try it.</li>
    <li> Great for people w/psoriasis</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price.  Fast delivery.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help with my particular type of dandruff and my hair loss.  It really didn&#x27;t seem to do much for either problem.  From what I hear, it does do wonders for some people, so give it a try and see if you are one of the lucky people.  Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t a silver bullet that fixes all problems for all people.</li>
    <li> It worked miracles for my daughter.  After trying 20 different items over the years this put an end to her dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years because it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> As a life long dandruff sufferer I have to tell you this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Another item in my artillary for pet skin care! Yes, it is designed for human use and is an excellent dandruff/itchy scalp shampoo, but we keep a bottle of this on hand for a couple of pets that are susceptible to fungal skin infections. Shampooing with Nizoral helps stop itchy skin problems in their tracks. Used in combo with chrolohexadrine spray, and an anti-fungal cream after shampoo, skin issues will clear up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Works well. Not the miracle shampoo I was hoping for from reading these reviews. The other shampoo I use is the tea tree oil shampoo by Paul Mitchel, which seemed to work just as well for me. Gets rid of dandruff, but the itch is still there.</li>
    <li> Something that actually works! Over the last few years I had developed worse and worse dandruff. I tried everything and nothing worked. My dandruff was so bad that it looked like my shoulders were covered in snowflakes and my head constantly itched like I had bugs crawling on it. I found this product on Amazon and it changed my life! My dandruff and itch was gone after the first use of this product! It is amazing!!! I have now been dandruff free for a couple months thanks to this stuff!! If you have dandruff problems, buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!!!! Some months ago I bought just a 7 oz bottle to prove it and just after three uses I totally felt the results. In just one week, my dandruff have disappeared. Now I bought some more bottles to keep the treatment. I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a very very dry scalp, this is the only product that provides dandruff relieve for me. Still not perfect but the best I have found so far</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s gotten rid of my dandruff, I also read about it helping with your hair loss. To my amazement it&#x27;s actually regrowing hair in spots that were going bald. Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> cures fungal rashes like miracles.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and it beats any other dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried, hands down.  My scalp was so itchy that it was driving me crazy but this helped from the first time I used it and after another use or two, I didn&#x27;t have the problem anymore.  Now, I rotate this shampoo in with the other ones about once a week or as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to believe that anyone is suffering hair loss from using this. I have thin, baby fine hair and this not only cleans all of the gunk out of my hair and scalp, it actually seems to give it more body and fullness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this 1% (blue bottle) version of the Nizorale product for several years and have found it to work like nothing else in stopping dandruff. It&#x27;s active ingredient (ketoconazole) kills an invisible skin surface microbe that is a common cause of dandruff. Fantastically effective! Works for several days. To get maximum mileage out of this expensive product, I first wash my hair with an ordinary shampoo for cleaning, then use this product (which you leave in 3-5 minutes) to treat the dandruff on a clean scalp. This way, you only need a dime-size drop for typical male hair-length, so it lasts a long time, given the relatively small bottle size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this 1% product has an unpleasant \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smell, which I naturally assumed came from the medicine in it. However, a couple years ago, there was a shortage in the U.S., and I had to buy a 2% (red bottle) version of the product from the U.K. Being twice as strong, I expected the 2% version to have twice the bad medicine smell. But, it turned out to be *unscented*. Truly, it had *no* smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, the company that makes Nizoral is adding an unpleasant \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smell to their 1% product for no other reason than to associate the smell with its effectiveness. This is unnecessary, wrong, and bad enough to stop some people from buying it, its unique effectiveness notwithstanding. If they&#x27;re going to add a scent, there is no reason it can&#x27;t be a pleasant one, since they are starting with a blank canvas. It is misguided marketing on their part to add a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the positive: I have thick hair, but I was noticing a lot of hair loss in the shower (along with intractable dandruff) before I started using this. Within a week, this product got rid of the dandruff *and* the hair coming out in the shower. When I use it, I also think my facial skin looks healthier and softer and more youthful. I think it prevents the build-up of dead skin associated with dandruff, resulting in better oxygenated, truly healthier skin and hair roots. My 12-year old daughter has greatly reduced acne when she uses this as well. Perhaps this is from a reduction of microbes and dead skin clogging her pores.</li>
    <li> tried everything for years and i&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, this is the only product that got rid of my dandruff. Seriously, gone like the second day. I use it like once a week, somewhat drying of course but did not effect my colored hair which i was afriad it might do!</li>
    <li> This stuff is my holy grail dandruff product. I have dandruff year-round, and my thick hair keeps it locked in. Nizoral is truly the only dandruff shampoo that nixes the problem within days of use, and it doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell. I wish it was a little bit cheaper, but it&#x27;s so worth it since it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
    <li> Has helped a lot. I been using it for about a week now ive used it about 4 times. Seen a lot of improvement hasnt gone away fully tho.</li>
    <li> I use for the compound ketoconazole to prevent hair loss, no new loss and along with my other routine I have stable hair.  (Update) Discontinuing in my routine after seeing noticeable reduction in hair, there are other shampoos with ketoconazole specifically for hair loss that may be a  better substitute.  This may work fine for dandruff but I would not recommend for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I think it works as well as my prescription shampoo, but I have only used it a few times or I might give it more stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Makes my hair super soft &amp; manageable. Use twice a week &amp; leave in till end of shower. Bought mainly for hair loss, jury still out, but my hair does look nice &amp; my scalp feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Effectively cleared any trace of dandruff. I still use this as my regular shampoo because I like it.. hopefully that&#x27;s not over applying it? I Dunno, good stuff</li>
    <li> Scalpacin helped me before, but this time my head was too dry and itchy and I had tons of dandruff. I never had this issue before but its annoying. After a week of use my itching is 90% better. Also, its almost DOUBLE the cost locally. Amazon has a fantastic price for the 7oz bottle. You use it like shampoo so I suggest getting 7 oz.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this shampoo! I used head and shoulders before i had to wash my hair at least once a day to get rid of flaking I had to be careful when I brushed my hair making sure to not bush close to my scalp because if not the flakes would just come back and my scalp would be so hot. The first time I used this shampoo my scalp and hair felt so clean and cool I wash my hair every other day or every 2 days depending on what I do between those days and NO FLAKES NO ITCHING I am so glad I found this!!</li>
    <li> I do not have dandruff, seborrhea or any other skin disorder on my scalp but my hair just loves this shampoo for some reason.  It always comes out soft and really manageable.  So much healthier looking then regular shampoo. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive. The good news is it seems very concentrated and I only need a small amount to do the job. You can also save it just for special occasions. Holidays, going out to dinner, date night, kids away, dogs birthday party, etc!  lol</li>
    <li> best non presciption hair shampoos according to my Dr</li>
    <li> I have tried every type of shampoo to try and solve my dandruff problem. This was my last attempt before going to get something prescribed .I&#x27;m so glad I have this a try! I would try other shampoos and they would work a a week or so abd my scalp would get use to them and flakes would return. After one week of the recommended use (use every three to four days) I was completely flake free with this shampoo. I&#x27;m a little over a month and I am still flake free and overall scalp health has improved.So happy I tried this!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, because he complained of flaky scalp, esp during the summer. Additionally, has a few of those bumps on the nape of his neck from shaving/cutting his own hair which I don&#x27;t like feeling (don&#x27;t agree with guys cutting their own hair, but eh...if close to shaving, then eh). He swears by this Nizoral! Compare to what he usually uses - selsun blue and other comparative store brand (he noted no flakes/dandruff since he start using it and bonus for me, the bumps are reducing in size). Now to get him to go the barber...Hhmmm;)</li>
    <li> Just as described. I have seen results with hair thickness and fullness following perssitent use</li>
    <li> This controls seborrehic dermatitis, and works very well for me.</li>
    <li> I use it as often as directed and it seems to work where many other shampoos haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my life. I&#x27;ve had horrible dandruff since I was 10 and I&#x27;ve been 100% dependent on Head &amp; Shoulders since then. Sure, Head &amp; Shoulder works ok, but only if I used it EVERY SINGLE DAY. If I didn&#x27;t use it that day, my hair would become greasy and the dandruff would come back with a vengeance by the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now I&#x27;m in medical school and of course I finally learn that dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) is caused by an abnormal immune response in the skin/scalp associated with the fungus Malassezia. It&#x27;s not an infection, but thought to be that Malassezia&#x27;s lipase activity increases inflammatory free fatty acids and activates certain pathways of the immune system locally. Basically, if you get rid of the fungus with a good anti-fungal (ketoconazole) you treat the dandruff. I use this product maybe once a week now, the rest of the time just using a regular shampoo, and man what a HUGE difference! The head &amp; shoulders was simply a bandaid that lasted 24 hrs, this stuff actually treats the cause of dandruff and lasts much longer. Please try this if you suffer from terrible dandruff like I do. You will not regret it. Also, it&#x27;s the same price at Walmart just FYI.</li>
    <li> Good for my scalp and nope, the dandruff issue never came back. Definitely sticking on this one.</li>
    <li> This was recently recommended by my new dermatologist for flaky skin (seborrheic dermatitis) and it seems to work well. I use it daily. It does sting the eyes and that is listed as a warning. I do not have a dandruff problem to know if this helps but it is likely. I had used Selsun Blue for many years but it had not helped me. I think the main ingredient is toxic and absorbed. There has been a recent warning that it is not approved for sale in CA.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this, will (and did) buy more, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos to get rid of my dandruff, nothing worked, until i found this. Thank God for this, now I have zero dandruff. I guess what worked is that it has actual anti fungal medicine called ketoconazole as the active ingredient, where as the other shampoos only have components that are supposed to slow down dandruff and not really treat the root cause.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to write a review of this, because truth be told I was expecting to either not work at all or stop working. I&#x27;ve tried everything for my dandruff, with no results, but this worked wonders. I&#x27;ve done Neutrogena, Sulfur8, Head and Shoulders (all different types), shampoos with coal in it, tea tree, apple cider vinegar (it worked once!), everything, and nothing&#x27;s worked. My dandruff was gross and embarrassing. But THIS has WORKED! And what&#x27;s better, since I am black I only wash my hair once a week, and I don&#x27;t even need to use this that often, so I switch between this and other non-medicated shampoos without issues. I keep waiting for it to not work, but I have been flake free for other a month. For someone who&#x27;s suffered from dandruff since I was a kid, that&#x27;s amazing. I love it! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right shampoo with the right ingredient, but this was the right product for me.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and the quality was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fighting severe dandruff for a while now, i just bought this 2 weeks ago and it worked since the first time i used it!!! I use it twice a week, i wash my hair every 3 days now, when before using this product i had to wash it every night.... And a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My son has tried just about everything for his recurring dandruff -- over the counter shampoos to home remedies.  This product has worked the best by far.  He has been using it for nearly a year now with excellent results.  It is the only shampoo he uses and it doesn&#x27;t dry out his hair even using it several times each week.</li>
    <li> Not a bad smell, and works as promised.</li>
    <li> Forget head &amp; shoulders. THIS is the bomb. Works great!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smelling nice &amp; volumized.  Best of all, not itchiness on the scalp.  Would buy this product again, if needed.</li>
    <li> this helped with my dog&#x27;s fungal skin infection after 2 showers in 7 days (got to leave on for 10 to 15 minutes)</li>
    <li> I have used this for 10 years or more.  It used to work perfectly, but it recently stopped working.  Unsure if their formula changed or if I have something else going on.</li>
    <li> I finally found the product that helps my dandruff and itchy scalp like crazy the first time I used this product I can see the changes in my scalp and I&#x27;m a dandruff free now. I would really recommend!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with a very sensitive and dry scalp for about 8 years now, and it always gets worse with the dryness of the winter. My scalp would flake very badly, and I&#x27;ve even developed some painful sores. Up until now, I have alternated between regular shampoo and Head &amp; Shoulders, both of which always made my scalp worse. This winter, I finally lost it and decided that I don&#x27;t have to live with this ridiculous problem anymore. Having bad flaking and sores doesn&#x27;t have to be part of my life. I did my researach and came across this product, which I decided would be my last resort. If this didn&#x27;t work, I was going to my doctor and finally explaining the extent of my problem.  Thankfully, this worked immediately. I followed the directions on the bottle, which say to use the product once a week after using it initially. The rest of the week, I use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo. I haven&#x27;t experienced any flaking or signs of sensitivity. No scalp problems at all. It feels weird to not have to think about it or worry about it any more.  Even though the bottle is small, it is lasting me a long time. Considering you only need to use it once a week for perfect results, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s not the most amazing smell in the world, but it&#x27;s just fine, doesn&#x27;t linger, and I find that it is easily masked by my other typical hair products. My hair is color treated, and this doesn&#x27;t affect the color at all. I found that my hair felt a little dry and stripped the first couple times I used it...probably because it finally washed away all that buildup. Since then, however, my hair feels soft and clean as it should be. I would recommend this for anyone with a dry scalp that feels like they&#x27;ve tried everything else and nothing works.  ***UPDATE: I just wanted to say that I have been using this product for over a year now, and it still works like a charm. I went through my orders and counted; I have purchased this product 5 times in a year and a month. That just goes to show you how long one little bottle lasts. I&#x27;m back for another! Give it a shot. This is just what you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> I had been using Stierprox to fight dry scalp. It worked, but I needed something better, something, that would &amp;#34;normalize&amp;#34; my dry skin for longer time. After some research I tried Nizoral and don&#x27;t regret it. Just after 10-12 days after using it I noticed, that something was missing - dandruff. Not 100% gone, but getting better and better. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Better than any dandruff shampoo you can find! Makes my head feel really reallllllly nice and no more itch what so ever! Depending on how much you use I can normally make this bottle last 2-3 months and I keep my hair somewhat short.</li>
    <li> I used H&amp;S for years and while it helped control the itch, the flakes never seemed to go away.  But even using it regularly I still had outbreaks that left my head so itchy I scratched till I bled. Sometimes I would switch it up to SB or just a plain shampoo for a few weeks to give my hair a break from the H&amp;S but always went back because my scalp would itch and flake all over again.  Then I read about Nizoral and found out it was no longer a prescription required product.  Lucky me because this stuff works and I don&#x27;t need to make a trip to the dermatologist.  I still get flakes from time to time but it went from snow to just that a few flakes.  My head doesn&#x27;t itch hardly ever and my scalp looks so nice and clear.  I find it strips my hair a little more than H&amp;S so I use it only a couple times a week.  I am a frequent hair washer due to oily hair so inbetween I use baby shampoo because it&#x27;s very gentle and a touch of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; to keep it safe from heat.  My hair is more manageable and itch/flake free than it has been in years.  I keep this on subscribe and save and haven&#x27;t gone back to H&amp;S since having found this.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo my husband uses. Excellent for hair loss.</li>
    <li> it really works... used it just thrice but its very effective</li>
    <li> excellent. exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Works great for itchy scalp when standard dandruff shampoos fail. Turns out it is caused by a common fungus that lives on human skin. This product controls its over growth, gross huh?</li>
    <li> PPP&#x3D;Perfectly pleasing purchase</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks, I still have some dandruff but less than before.</li>
    <li> Great! They smell so good too and my dry scalp problems are gone for good.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have used for my dandruff. Didn&#x27;t even see a speck of dandruff with my black tops after two uses.</li>
    <li> I am postmenopausal and have begun suffering from an itchy scalp.  No dandruff or redness, just itching.  I started using this product, and within three washes, my head no longer itches.  What an incredible relief!  The scent is mild and very pleasant.  I use the product as directed.</li>
    <li> Nice product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for dry scalp but after googling it I used it for acne as well. I wanted to write a review because it&#x27;s the only the thing that has cured my acne. I bought Nizoral because my scalp was kinda itchy from the dry weather. I google everything. A bunch of hits kept coming up for Nizoral and acne. People were saying it was a miracle. I&#x27;ve had moderate to severe acne for the past 10 years. Mainly on my jaw line and neck. It&#x27;s painful, embarrassing and scaring. I&#x27;ve tried everything. ProActiv, soaps, over the counter everything, countless number of RX topical creams, several antibiotics several times over the years(one dr gave me bactrum for a year, that&#x27;s not good) and a laser treatment costing $500 and it didn&#x27;t do anything. So I already had the shampoo and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt. After 2 days I noticed I didn&#x27;t have any new breakouts and after a week my old breakouts were all healed. My skin is smoother and more clear than its been in forever. I wanted to share with others who fight with acne. Once a day, usually at night, I put it on my face and neck and leave it on for about 5 minutes and then wash off. Good luck to anyone who tries it.</li>
    <li> Had scalp issues for a very long time. This shampoo worked after tons of different tar, head&amp;shoulder types.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Did wonders on my itchy and flaky scalp. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this together with the Sage Shampoo, so I&#x27;m not really sure which one works. But it has lessen my dandruff a bit. Not just as much as I wish it would.</li>
    <li> My first use I was skeptic since I still had some flaking. Third use I noticed great improvement and barely any itching. I&#x27;m probably on my 5th use and feeling relieved that something is actually helping. Not sure if it had to do with my scalp condition but my hair does not feel as oily and gross as it did before I began using this. As silly as it sounds I no longer feel self conscious about flaking showing throughout my hair and perimeter of my hair line. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife love it thats why i give this review and planing to buy more in the future... Buy it</li>
    <li> I use this product for almost one year now and I get good result</li>
    <li> I just want to say truly about this product. I have bought everything in site to help me with my dandruff problem. Nothing ever seem to work. I was about to go to the Dr for help. Till I found Nizoral. WOW that&#x27;s all I can say. I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore with dandruff. You&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about if you purchase this. Keep it up Nizoral you&#x27;re the greatest.</li>
    <li> Controls dandruff better than anything I have tried.</li>
    <li> The only anti dandruff shampoo that works</li>
    <li> I use it several times a week.  Great for overall health of the scalp... oh yea feels great YES YES!</li>
    <li> Does the job, especially in reducing the effects of tinnea!</li>
    <li> Great Product , Great Price</li>
    <li> My dandruffs are gone</li>
    <li> Dandruff free for months after just one use. Amazing results.</li>
    <li> The product was not helpful</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my life! I was suffering from severe sebaceous dermatitis (severe dandruff / scaling) and this shampoo helped much more than the prescribed one by the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I am a teacher at an elementary school - one unfortunate situation elementary school teachers happen upon is head lice (yes, even if your hair is clean you can get it, especially when you work with the primary grades!). Upon being checked the school nurse mentioned that I had some dandruff which was contributing to my itchy scalp and suggested purchasing some Nizoral. I don&#x27;t use it regularly but if I notice a higher level of dandruff or that my scalp is itching more than normal I&#x27;ll use it for a few days and it always helps. I would highly recommend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> I had never had dandruff before, but my scalp recently started itching and wouldn&#x27;t stop.  I did a bit of research and started with a home remedy (apple cider vinegar rinse) to change my scalp pH.  That helped a little, but the problem didn&#x27;t resolve.  I next tried a popular anti-dandruff shampoo, again with minimal result.  Nizoral did the trick.  Yes, it is expensive and yes, it is not the greatest shampoo for your hair, but it sure worked wonders for my scalp.  I don&#x27;t mind my hair being a bit limp a couple of days a week as long as I no longer have that annoying itch.</li>
    <li> A good anti-fungal shampoo that helps control seborratic dermatitis (dandruff) which is caused by fungus.  I leave it on as treatment for about an hour before I actually shampoo my hair.  Nizoral is a aid, but you must also watch your diet, avoiding high carbs and sugars which feed fungus.  Nizoral was recommended on knowthecause.com.</li>
    <li> This product got rid of my itchy scalp after 2-3 uses over a one week period. Now I use it twice per week and it has kept the itchy and patches of super dry scalp away for 2 months. Nothing has worked so well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny story-I initially bought Nizoral for my little Yorkshire Terrier who has been having terrible skin issues (really gross) and read that this may help. I brushed her really well to loosen the flaky skin and then lathered her up, let the shampoo sit for maybe 2 minutes and rinsed her. Dramatically better after one wash and almost gone after 2. Even the prescriptions from the Vet and diet changes had no dramatic improvement on her skin. I plan to keep using this on both of our locks! It is a tiny bottle for a steep price-but so worth the results. The smell isn&#x27;t strong like the coal tar shampoos and it lathers nicely and rinses out easily.I continue to use my regular hair products with this stuff and my hair looks pretty good.</li>
    <li> Within a day or so, itching gone and only small/light flaking. Yet learned other products did just as well, Selsun Blue being one of them. Keep in mind I tried Nizoral because Head &amp; Shoulders did not work for me. I use a separate conditioner with either product, I find this works the best for me.</li>
    <li> good to see this back on the market ..an effective product</li>
    <li> The only dandruff shampoo that works for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever tried.  If you have dry scalp, flaking, even severe irritation use this once or twice a week and you will be amazed.  Somewhat expensive but the result is worth it.</li>
    <li> very effective anti-itch and anti-dandruff.  It worked with several other products did not.  It works best use this and then head and shoulders 2 in 1 afterwards.  However, great product</li>
    <li> really cleared up what I thought was a skin problem.  need to use for a couple of weeks to see full results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a week now, and my scalp is no better.  Price was right, but is it medicated??</li>
    <li> Only shampoo that helps with dry scalp..</li>
    <li> Helps manage the dandruff and leaves hair silky smooth. Nice!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with how fast this product came. Works very well. Have tried a lot of other dandruff products and this is the only one that works for my husband. Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, used as directed it cleared everything up after ~3 uses. I use it once a week now for maintenance, then use &amp;#34;Alfaparf Illuminating Serum, Cristalli Liquidi&amp;#34; to restore the oils it strips out of the hair. Dandruff free, and my hair has never been more healthy!</li>
    <li> Helped my dog who had terrible sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years and have tried every product i could get my hands on. Finally I tried this and finally found the solution! I simply love it...!</li>
    <li> really helps. can see results after a couple of wash.</li>
    <li> A life-changing experience</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, shipped fast, great service. Will probably buy this again as needed.</li>
    <li> This product works if your dandruff is caused by a fungal infection.  However, I find I have to use it every other day in order for it to KEEP working.  I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than a couple of days without the itching, etc. starting right up again.  Still - it&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s ever worked for me and I&#x27;ll continue buying it.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It supposedly takes 8 weeks to work and I am in week 4.  I will come back in 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFFFFF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A while back, raised red lesions appeared at the base of my head. They itched so badly that sometimes I drew blood scratching them. Head &amp; Shoulders did absolutely nothing for me so I visited my doc who prescribed 2% ketoconazole shampoo. The shampoo worked wonders and I immediately stopped itching, but my scalp continued to flare up every now and then. Darn that resilient malassezia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a move, I misplaced my precious prescription strength shampoo so I bought Nizoral because my scalp was crazy itchy. This stuff was equally effective, smelled nicer, and lathered better than the translucent pink prescription stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I experimented with solely using this product for about a week as suggested by other reviewers, my hair, which is horribly frizzy and unhealthy looking to begin with, started feeling dry and junkier. So I went back to using it alongside other products.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this shampoo. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just dry red scalp and some hair loss. Candida overgrowth perhaps? Not sure but it&#x27;s one of my theories to my slight hair loss, so I&#x27;m trying this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very itchy scalp.. Doctor can&#x27;t find the cause if it.. This is the only shampoo that I find will tame my itchy scalp. Been using for yrs. great product!</li>
    <li> This product works. I get flaky skin on my scalp all the time even though I wash my hair very frequently and it is very frustrating. So far,  it has be the only product that has helped with my dandruff. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. Make sure to read the directions as it is not to be used every day.</li>
    <li> I have a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis and added this to my products in rotation (h&amp;s, selenium sulfide, etc).I find that the Nizoral 2% shampoo is a lot stronger than this one (more potent and does the job better) but unlike the 2%, this one doesn&#x27;t cause the extreme hair-drying effect that makes my hair look like hay. Also, I can use it more frequently than the 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find that Nizoral 1% has almost the same effect as h&amp;s classic. It doesn&#x27;t totally remove the itch and dandruff but it makes it manageable and tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s permanently getting a spot in my dandruff fighting system.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nizoral either as the commercial brand or as a prescription for many years.  It is the only shampoo that relieves he of an itchy scale and dandruff.  No other shampoo has ever worked for me.  Some others that I have used in the past caused my hair to fall out.  Others I would have to use every day and some more than once a day.  With Nizoral I can go 2 or 3 days without washing my hair with it and my hair stays itch and dandruff free.  There was a time when I could find it in stores bur lately one of the only places where I am able to find it as at Amazon.  Not only have I found it on Amazon, the price that I paid is as good or better than any other online outlet.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo that has ever worked to eliminate my dandriff</li>
    <li> my husband gets itchy, flakey eyebrows and beard (when he&#x27;s growing one).  Using this a few times a week really helps him.</li>
    <li> Great antidandruff shampoo. Have been using for years, once/twice a month and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It does what it states it will do plus it leaves my hair looking great! Thanks for a great product. Shalom!!</li>
    <li> Although not fully supported indication, I use this to treat hair loss. Two weeks of daily shampooing with Nizoral makes a dent in hair loss.</li>
    <li> Solved my husband&#x27;s long-term dandruff!</li>
    <li> After wasting hundreds of dollars on anti-dandruff products. I was desperate. My hair was flaky, itchy, stinky, and falling out!! It wasn&#x27;t until I told my sister about the problems I was having that I found out about Nizoral. She told me that when her baby girl had really bad cradle cap her doctor suggested that she use Nizoral and Hydro cortisone to stop the itch. On hearing this, I ordered Nizoral right a way. After the first use, I could see and feel a difference. Usually, after washing my hair, my head would still be itchy and it would start getting flaky after a few days. After, using Nizoral, I went a whole week without washing my hair and I had only a few flakes!!! I have been using Nizoral for about a month now and my hair is no longer falling out. It is no longer itchy and it only gets somewhat flaky after going about a week without washing it.Thus, I would suggest this to anyone who really wants to put an end to their dandruff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Johnson &amp; Johnson for creating such a wonderful anti-dandruff shampoo. Now, I just have to find a good product that will grow my hair back :(.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that works this well.  It has cleared up my build up better than T-Sal, T-Gel, etc.</li>
    <li> if your reading this then you already know nizoral is a needed shampoo to control flakes and build up.</li>
    <li> It has ketokonazole which is not only an anti fungal but it blocks DHT (an androgen and byproduct of testosterone) at the hair follicle, which is responsible for male pattern baldness! So in other words it will help with thinning or loss of hair too! Totally worth always using</li>
    <li> Simply the best Anti-Dandruff shampoo on the market.  So glad the shortages of a few years ago are over.  This product has been life changing.  I have less scalp itch, less hair loss, and healthier hair.  You don&#x27;t need much, a large bottle can last me a year or more.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there. Nothing else to say</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY WORKS FOR HAIR REGROWTH AND INCREASING DENSITY! I&#x27;m a 21-year-old guy with a reasonably decent hairline but a slight widows peak. This shampoo has increased the thickness and density of my hair, increased vellus hairs, and since I&#x27;ve been growing out my now glorious thick hair all summer, I can see shorter, thinner hairs appearing further down my hairline and and my hairline is thicker overall. I combine this with jojoba oil and apply to my hair for 5-8 minutes every 1-2 days. I feel lucky for knowing about this because my hair is amazing now.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time.. very nice. used it once/twice a week and can see the difference.Will buy more as needed</li>
    <li> last two years I do have dunduf problems,tryed many diferent shampoos but no one helped me, than I give a try to this stuff and it is a mirracle. 60ml this shampoo in rep. Of Georgia costs 12$, so buying this on amazon I did a huge saving.</li>
    <li> its okay, be noticed it has only 1% of effective substance</li>
    <li> Got rid of severe dermatitis that was caused by nonsulphates shampoos. Tried everything but this is the only product that worked 100%, scalp is clear within a few times using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> love it. I use it once a week. it can clean my head very well.</li>
    <li> I have itchy dandruff all over my scalp. For sure, my husband would be disappointed even though I’m gorgeous. I tried several products which claim that I will be dandruff-free by using it. However, they’re all liars. Lastly, I tried this Nizoral Shampoo. After many years of patiently waiting for the best product, it is worth the wait. My dandruff is gone. I have zero dandruff! I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Tried different brands and this one by far is the best anti-dandruff shampoo ever. IT WORKS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> it works ! I tried two times and it works so well !</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Nothing works better than NIzoral to stop my dandruff.  After taking a shower and my head feels clean and the itching stops.  Honestly this is by far the best product on dandruff.</li>
    <li> get rid of dandruff, amazing product, it really works!</li>
    <li> Been having issues with dandruff for a couple of years. I tried everything (selsun blue, head and shoulders, natural way) and nothing worked for me. After using it for a week, all my dandruff was gone! I now use it only once a week and have not had any dandruff issues. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has dandruff issues and tried everything. The cost might be a little steep but it is worth it to not have annoying dandruff anymore.</li>
    <li> The price is a bit high for the small bottle that you get. I&#x27;m actually using this as a remedy for thinning hair, instead of dandruff. It functions as an androgen blocker, preventing the type of scalp inflammation that can cause hair loss. My wife says it&#x27;s working well, but maybe she&#x27;s just trying to flatter me.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and disappointed that it has been discontinued in many retail stores. It&#x27;s powerful enough to get rid of psoriasis. Unfortunately this time I had different reasons for why I was itching on my scalp but nevertheless this shampoo does the work for any type of skin fungi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for years.  I find it very effective and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> using this daily it works perfectly</li>
    <li> Great product! I highly recommend it ,the only  downside of it is that sometimes its hard to find even on line..</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for my itchy scalp. I switch between a zinc shampoo and this one. Has a nice fragrance and I am totally flake free with it.</li>
    <li> I havent really seen a difference. It smells good tho.</li>
    <li> this has worked beyond my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had VERY dry scalp which nothing would help. i tried Olive Oil, leave in conditioners, not washing my hair to washing it every day or every other day and NOTHING helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister told me about &amp;#34;Nizoral&amp;#34; and i thought to mysle it probably would not work but its worth a try anyway. Once it came in the mail i tried it right away and I was very concerned to why all my dry scalp was now throughout my hair but then thought maybe it was loosing up everything or watever (i was very frustrated), so the next day i used it again and already seen some progress by the 3rd or 4th day i was literally the happiest person alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after trying everything and being so frustarted that nothing was helping to finally finding something that helped!</li>
    <li> In winter I will have a severe dryness. Tried lot of products including selsun blue. They were not able to help much. But nizroral is able control in 2 uses.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my dandruff, but the shampoo did greatly reduce it. It has been the only product to work for me and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am rewriting this review.   I have been using this product once in a while whenever I have itchy scalp that really agitated me. It really works on itchy scalp. I think I had dandruff in the past because I had some other medical issue but after that was treated, all the dandruff went away.  I am happy with this product but I do not use this product everyday because It has harsh chemicals. So I use organic shampoo and conditioner and then use this product once in a while when I have itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dandruff while mainly using the mainstream products like Head and Shoulders,  Selsun Blue, and Neutrogena. I only need to wash with Nizoral every 3 or 4 days, and have been flake free since using it. Only downside is it tends to leave your hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is more smoother and conditioning than other shampoos that are made for similar problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a suggestion from my dermatologist, due to an issue with hairline pimples. I have never had any problem with dandruff, but I do get a dry scalp from time to time. It seems that the shampoo is working for me. I have not had any bad reactions to it. I use a small amount following my regular shampoo, because it is too expensive to wash my whole hair with. But so far, I actually love it. I like the way it makes my hair feel nice and clean, so I might just stick with it even beyond my dermatologists suggested use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. I use it about once a week and my scalp has never been happier--and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff issues since I was a teenager and nothing seems to have ever worked for me. None of the regular dandruff shampoos (head &amp; shoulders, selsun blue etc) did the trick. I realized (after using a shampoo from Europe) that it was the ketoconazole ingredient that was missing from these others, so when I found Nizoral on Amazon I pounced. So glad I did, itching is a thing of the past now! Excellent shampoo and so glad they carry it.</li>
    <li> Tried this product out after doctor&#x27;s recommendation. Best dandruff shampoo I ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, had a moderate - MAXIMISING dandruff and the first week of the application of Nizoral Shampoo antidandruff my hair is fully restored, dandruff and the results are lasting.</li>
    <li> Works great! No danruff bothers after the third use. Would like to give 5 if it has a more refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> Good product keep my hair clean and health... Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> First use did make it seem like working but flakes &amp; itching did not go away after consecutive uses. It did reduce my flakes but was not able to remove them completely. Also itching has not reduced.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me. I have no idea why I stopped using it, TBH. I&#x27;ve recently been using Neutrogena coal tar, but it hasn&#x27;t really been helping and my scalp has still been itchy and scaly with build-up. It has also been breaking off my hair like crazy. I decided to switch back to Nizoral and after the first wash, my scalp is almost completely clear. I was diagnosed with Seb-Psoriasis, so I still noticed a few red spots on my scalp, but there are no flakes whatsoever. I also notice just some buildup, but I&#x27;m positive with continued use, that will decrease dramatically. I&#x27;ve read that this promotes hair growth as well! And since my hair has been breaking off from the coal tar, I&#x27;m looking forward to these added benefits!</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago my skin and hair became very sensitive and itchy. I felt like I was allergic to everything! I switched my body wash, lotion, laundry detergent, and dryer sheets to fragrance-free and dye-free. I would use my Cetaphil lotion a lot on my skin to moisturize and help with the dry, itchiness. I was checked for lice and don&#x27;t have it. I&#x27;ve bought several hair shampoos and scalp treatments for itchy, dry scalp and still suffer from it. I was hoping this anti-fungal shampoo would kill the bacteria that causes itchy dandruff and solve my problem. I also bought Paul Mitchell Tea Tree oil scalp treatment. But I&#x27;m still itchy!! This shampoo helps some with the itching, but not enough.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product for my thinning hair so the &amp;#34;juries still out&amp;#34;.  Lathers well.  Smells decent too.</li>
    <li> This product really does work against dandruff! Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference in the feel of my hair and scalp by the 2nd time I used it. I use it on my beard as well because I get flaky dry skin under it too and I like how soft it makes it feel.</li>
    <li> Seems to help when alternated with other products.</li>
    <li> My scalp was itched at least few times every day. I tried Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo without much success for months.&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 4 days, the itching was gone and I stopped using it since there was no need to continue. I am not sure how about how safe it is but for sure it helped me get rid of the itching quick. That was wonderful. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had dry and itchy scalp for about a month and tried other products, this is the only one that has worked.&lt;br /&gt;I does take two to three washing&#x27;s before it&#x27;s entirely under control, but you can feel the difference with the first washing.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Hardly ever write reviews. I have struggled with terrible dry scalp. Tried almost everything. Found this on Amazon and tried it a couple months ago. One application...flakiness GONE! I waiting about 3 to 4 weeks and washed for a second time. It has been two months now and I can tell you I have no dryness at all and only used this product  twice. I alternatively wash my hair with an organic...less chemical shampoo but will grab this again when I see the snowflakes falling.</li>
    <li> A miracle in a bottle. Nothing else works as well as this against dandruff!!</li>
    <li> PERFECT VERY GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> This product is recommended by my physician and it works real well.</li>
    <li> Use this product a lot and this was a great price.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me to help resolve my scalp acne.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the non-prescription Nizoral yet, but I imagine it will work great. I currently have the prescription Nizoral which has 2% Ketoconazole instead of 1%. I don&#x27;t think the 1% difference will be that noticeable so I decided to buy this while it was on sale so I can try it after I run out of my prescription bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prescription Nizoral took some time to take affect. When I first started to use it, I noticed huge flakes. When that happened, I just ran a comb through my hair to get rid of it. After the second week, it was gone. I believe it was exfoliating my scalp. Now, I don&#x27;t see any flakes. The real test will be when winter comes. It is extremely dry here in the winter and really dries my scalp out.</li>
    <li> It dries up the scalp completely. It is supposed to stop dandruff but when we use it the skin starts to scale and the scalp gets super itchy.</li>
    <li> Itching gone, flaking decreased waiting for total inhalation :)</li>
    <li> We use this shampoo to help treat our Westy&#x27;s hot spots and other skin problems. It is very expensive, so we usually shampoo with regualr dog shampoo and then spot treat with this shampoo. Do not use on any open sores as it will be too harsh. My only complaintis that it is too expensive!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years to keep my dandruff at bay. Walmart used to sell this but they dont anymore, necessitating purchases thru Amazon. Price is about the same when my local Walmart sold it. Smells good and only a dime-sized drop in enough to get a lot of lather.</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical at first, I bought it based on other positive reviews, but it works! My hair is flake free. I can wear black colored shirts, and most importantly my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore! I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from flakes and dandruff, I&#x27;ve tried almost all shampoos and nothing was working, actually made everything worse! this shampoo however is a miracle for hair and the scalp. A++++</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, and super fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works&lt;br /&gt;Found it works better than any other product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say I love Nizoral. I had moderate dandruff that didn&#x27;t require a visit to the doctor, but still was becoming a huge hassle. Head &amp; Shoulders as well as Selsun Blue did not work at all to solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few uses of Nizoral, virtually all itching gone, huge reduction in flaking. A week or two in, you&#x27;ll forget you even had dandruff. Only thing is, you do kinda have to keep using it. The price is steep, but you can use a small amount and still have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the term lightly, but I believe this honestly is a miracle product. I completely stand by Nizoral and recommend it to anyone suffering from Dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Long term review, Nizoral still works but sometimes I can get dandruff &amp;#34;flare ups&amp;#34; that Nizoral still can&#x27;t take care of. I have started to leave the Nizoral in for a couple minutes and it seems to help. While not perfect, I still consider it the best over the counter medication available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad they started selling this stuff again... I had to smuggle some 2% ketoconazole in from Thailand back during the dark, fearful days of 2013.  It&#x27;s much more effective than typical dandruff shampoos (pyrithione, salicylic acid, etc.).  I keep a bottle of this and a bottle of selenium sulfide shampoo (H&amp;S clinical strength, I think) because the effectiveness of each seems to alternate seasonally.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for my seborrheic dermatitis. I could never find anything that worked better than just okay until I tried this. My head does not itch anymore and the flakes are gone. It&#x27;s a miracle cure!</li>
    <li> I had always had dandruff problems. I have tried selsum blue and head and shoulders, but they are a waste of money. I saw results of less dandruff after just using this for just a week.</li>
    <li> Very impressed thus far.  I saw an improvement even after my first use, and would recommend this for anyone suffering from dandruff.</li>
    <li> after a few time use, i don&#x27;t see dandruff any more. it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Good:  I&#x27;m not dumping white flakes everywhere any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:  I still have head zits, they&#x27;re really the reason I got this.  I was hoping this would take care of those as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has at least helped my dandruff issues, so I&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works. Yes, it works from the first use. Not only eliminates the dandruff after a couple of days using it, it also makes your hair silky and lasting clean longer. Absolutely perfect after trying many other expensive brands that didn&#x27;t solve the problem 100%. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff since my early 20&#x27;s. As I got older it worsened and I noticed that with the changes in season it would become especially severe with dryness and scaling and was absolutely embarrassing. I&#x27;ve tried selson blue, head and shoulders, t-gel, among other things. I did not particularly like the smell and their effectiveness was short term. Nizoral has been the ONLY thing that has stopped my dandruff in its tracks. I only have to use it once every 3-4 days and have even done once a week with stellar results. It costs more and there&#x27;s a reason for it; IT WORKS! I autoship 1 bottle every 3 months and that&#x27;s enough to maintain dandruff free hair for me.</li>
    <li> Killed my flakes dead. It took a few applications, but after maybe 4 uses I havent seen a flake in over a month.</li>
    <li> Used it twice a week for two months. No more dandruff. Daily use of Head and Shoulders never did this.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have tried many different options and nothing has really worked, or if it did, it dried out my hair. This leaves me hair dandruff free and super soft. It only took a couple of washes. I dread the day it stops working, but I will be buying in bulk until then!</li>
    <li> My husband has a very bad dandruff problem. I bought this shampoo after reading all the reviews, he has been using this shampoo every day for more than 3 weeks now.. But I don&#x27;t see any visible improvement. Still gonna the whole bottle, hopefully he will have some improvement soon</li>
    <li> After Head and Shoulders did not work, I tried this product and it worked! No more itchy scalp bumps.</li>
    <li> After years of incurable dandruff I finally went to a dermatologist who explained my dandruff was seborrheic dermatitis- a common, inflammatory skin condition that causes flaky, white to yellowish scales to form on oily areas such as the scalp or inside the ear. All these years I thought it was dry scalp and was using moisturizing head and shoulders, T-gel, with no success, and now I know why. She prescribed loprox/ciclopirox shampoo at a $25 copay and when I ran out, I didn&#x27;t want to pay my dermatologist a $45 copay AND another $25 to renew the prescription shampoo, so I did my homework and found out my prescription shampoo was basically an anti-fungal shampoo and I came across this &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; OTC version. It was on back order for a while and was about $19 on Amazon, and could only be shipped in from the UK, but now I see the supply is back in, and I paid about $14.50 with free PRIME shipping. It works amazingly! Just as good if not better than my prescription version, and cheaper!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after trying many other products to treat his dandruff and it&#x27;s amazing!  no more wasting money on head n shoulders, this is the best!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo....stopped flakiness.....fast delivery....</li>
    <li> This works great for me and my scalp.  I have had this problem for a long time and this seems to ease all of my problems so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for several years to keep dandruff in check.  Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price and convenience with Subscribe &amp; Save.  My local pharmacy has it for 50% more. If you have problem dandruff, this strength is not effective; you need prescription strength 2%.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for me personally!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure what stopped my hair loss in it&#x27;s tracks, but I think Nizoral has played an important role!</li>
    <li> It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a year. Good shampoo and makes scalp and hair feel good but I don&#x27;t think it works to stop hair loss. At least not for me anyeay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff forever and I have always used Head and Shoulder&#x27;s.  It never really worked and I came across this stuff online one day when looking for a new product to try.  I was turned off by the price (it is pretty expensive for shampoo), plain packaging and fact I had never heard of it before.  All I can say is that this stuff is amazing.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I have used it for a month and I have no dandruff at all.  I Highly recommend it FIVE STARS FOR SURE!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I use it about every 2-3 weeks.  Regular shampoo other times.  No need to use this every time.</li>
    <li> It did what it advertised !!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that works for me.</li>
    <li> Nizoral reduces the itch on my scalp</li>
    <li> Nizoral basically is a very good product and the item which is available through subscription is really very good and effective . But this one, available without prescription is not that effective. I&#x27;m not seeing any changes. I feel my regular tea tree shampoos are better than this. My suggestion is to go for a prescriped one, if you are really serious about getting it cured. This is not going to help.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth time ordering this product. Does the job well! After a couple of washes my dandruff is gone! It is the only product that works for my head. No other over the counter product works. The shipping was fast too. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Brilliant brilliant brilliant</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever controlled my dandruff like this product. Those winter months... and it&#x27;s not bad for a balding guy either! hands up.</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t really helped my dandruff.  It&#x27;s just like buying any other antidandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was very effective! It was the only product that stopped both the itching and the flaking. And it actually smells nice!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Works really well. My son had some serious flaking going on and he had developed Seborrheic dermatitis. This product has taken care of all of the flaking. None of the other dandruff shampoos ever worked ver well for my son. I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found something that works. Lather up, leave it in a few minutes and then rinse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d stopped using Nizoral years ago. Though I was only in my 30s and very healthy, I noticed that when I was regularly using this product I experienced a dull but nagging chest pain. As soon as I stopped, the pain went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a decade. I decided to try Nizoral again. After using it three times, there was the pain again. I quit for a week. The pain went away. I tried it again. The pain returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is anecdotal, and yes, this may be limited to only me. Perhaps it&#x27;s not even related to this product. But it has me concerned enough, that I&#x27;ll not be using the product again.</li>
    <li> It works well for me. After using several times, prob went away and never comes back. I hv dry skin and dry scalp so I use it first and combine other shampoo for dry hair for the second time when I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why this product has been scarce in the stores. The ingredient, Ketoconazole, blocks testosterone conversion to dht and thus it prevents balding in men. Google Ketoconazole and balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it because it was recommended by my dermatologist to prevent dandruff.  Because of the high price, I use it sparingly. I lather and rinse twice with a small amount of inexpensive shampoo, then use a few drops of this stuff to lather again, finish the rest of my shower, then rinse. The directions say that you should leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing. It works.</li>
    <li> Make sure you research side effects before using this. Definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> perfect. just as expected.</li>
    <li> Really good for itchy scalp.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> seems to have helped with dry scalp. i will continue using as recommended.</li>
    <li> Will dry your hair, but good product for a fussy scalp.</li>
    <li> The only product that has helped my daughter&#x27;s severe dandruff. I buy it monthly and it truly works.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing!! Dandruff bothers me for a long time, and this product really helps! No ithcy and dandruff any more for the first time use. I&#x27;m super dry and fine hair btw</li>
    <li> Good shampoo at 1% Ketoconazole Made in Belgium</li>
    <li> I know I likely sound like a fake reviewer for saying it, but this is the first antidandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that worked as well as it did. The next closest thing I&#x27;ve used is the Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength shampoo ([[ASIN:B0043OSIVM Clinical Strength Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis Shampoo 13.5 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]]), but it smelled like sulfur to me and made my already coarse hair &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; out, for lack of a more eloquent explanation. I assume it just really dried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nizoral doesn&#x27;t do any of that - it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it and if anything, it probably wouldn&#x27;t make a great cleansing shampoo, as my hair still feels a little greasy if I use it once without anything else. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m actually happy it&#x27;s like that and would take that over something that dries my hair out any day.  I don&#x27;t know how often it&#x27;d happen for anyone else, but it actually made my dandruff worse the first time I used it, but after that, most of it was gone within a week. That&#x27;s a first for me - even the clinical strength Head and Shoulders, with its obvious drawbacks, made my dandruff manageable at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually ordered four boxes of this thanks to a good sale on it a few weeks ago. Let&#x27;s just hope it keeps working. It&#x27;s nice to be able to wear black (my favorite shirt color - having red hair, I feel like most colors don&#x27;t look great on me) without constantly having to look at my shoulders and make sure there&#x27;s nothing there.</li>
    <li> I think is good product</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a charm. I have no dandruff ever anymore. I only use it once a week as well.</li>
    <li> Good Work. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, better than Head and shoulders! It is great to control dandruff and rid your scalp and body of any fungus on the skin. I highly recommend this product. It leaves your hair feeling very clean, leaves no build up and does not dry out your hair. I wash once with a regular shampoo, then use this for my second wash and leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes for effectiveness then rinse. After using several different ones, this by far has worked the best!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo for a multiplicity of hair and body needs.  Good aroma.</li>
    <li> Despite the other reviews on here about the formula changing, the shampoo is the same and it works for dandruff. great buy</li>
    <li> eliminated skin irritation after one use!</li>
    <li> Used as directed for a couple of months and I no longer have visible flaking or an itchy scalp. I plan on continuing to use this once or twice a week to keep it that way. This stuff works, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling like a freshly paved road!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my dandruff is nearly all gone. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve used a variety of products including head and shoulders, neutrogena etc without any significant results. It&#x27;s weird scratching my head and not seeing a flurry of flakes. I still have the odd flake, but then again I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, although I have only used for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Nizoral was my salvation - It cleared my really stubborn dandruff after a couple of uses.  However, after a couple of months, the flaky, scaly scalp returned just like it was before.  I tried letting the Nizoral sit on my scalp in the shower, but it didn&#x27;t remove the dandruff anymore.  I finally saw the dermatologist and he smirked when I said I&#x27;d been using Nizoral.  He said he&#x27;d give me something that really works...I left with a sample of T-Sal shampoo and a prescription for Lidex solution.  The T-Sal needs to be applied twice and sit on your scalp for a few minutes, and its tough to rinse out.  My hair had volume, shine, smoothness, and NO CLUMPS OR FLAKES or dry scalp.  No odor, doesn&#x27;t strip haircolor, but just a little drying on the hands.  Take the time to apply twice and let it sit on your scalp, and rinse really, really well.  I may not even need the Lidex solution - Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Based on these reviews, I was SO excited to try this product.  I truly don&#x27;t understand why it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My dandruff tends to come and go based on my stress level, diet, etc.  I was getting pretty itchy and flaky lately, so I took a lot of time researching dandruff shampoos. This product topped the list, so I decided to order it.  I headed straight for the shower the second I received it.  I was very pleased with the fresh, pleasant smell and slight tingling feeling.  My hair felt soft as I rinsed the shampoo out.  After my shower, I wrapped my hair in a towel and came back to my bathroom mirror 5 minutes  later to comb my hair out.  I unwrapped the towel, looked in the mirror and saw (with sheer horror) that my hair was full of white flakes!!  I first thought it was lint from the towel, but as I picked the stuff out, I confirmed it was in fact skin/scalp flakes.  I had to use a fine tooth comb and blow-dry my hair extra long to get all the flakes out.  I&#x27;ve never experienced flakes in my hair after using a dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was a fluke or perhaps the shampoo helped to slough my scalp, so I gave it another chance.  SAME thing happened the next time I washed my hair - I unwrapped the towel, and saw my head was full of flakes.  In fact, after spending extra time getting all the flakes out, I looked in the mirror later in the day while at work, and there were a few large flakes stuck in my bangs.  I also noticed this shampoo made my hair pretty oily both times after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why this seemingly great shampoo didn&#x27;t work for me, but it didn&#x27;t - it really seemed to make my dandruff worse.  I used another dandruff shampoo after I stopped using this one, and my hair was completely flake free.  I have no choice but to give this one star  :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to stop hair loss for a month now. It greatly reduced hair fall outs. I use it every 3 days along with Purador anti-hairloss shampoo.</li>
    <li> The only thing that works on dandruff. Two or three uses a couple days apart and it&#x27;s gone for three or four weeks at least.</li>
    <li> This works great for my husband where Head and Shoulders does nothing for him.</li>
    <li> For at least a 3 years, maybe more, I had a problem with that I thought was &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; and nothing seemed to work at getting rid of the problem. I tried all the normal shampoo, H&amp;S, T-gel, T-sal...etc. They worked ok, but within a few days the flakes would come back. I saw this shampoo on Slickdeals.net, read the reviews, and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Well holy crap, after just the first use, the flakes were almost gone. By the third time using the shampoo, not a flake in sight! It&#x27;s been about 2 months, maybe 3, and I have used the shampoo maybe 4 times; my &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; hasn&#x27;t come back. To be honest, I may not have actually had dandruff, but rather some bacterial scalp infection, not that it matters now because it&#x27;s all gone :-)</li>
    <li> It works! Not sure how safe it is - tons of warnings on the bottle and it seems like your supposed to limit use. first thing ive found that actually works!</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic during my first month of use - I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the only shampoo that has left me completely flake free, even with only one wash a week!    Then, gray hairs started sprouting like weeds on my scalp. I&#x27;m a 27-year old female! My hair is thinner in some spots as well. It&#x27;s no coincidence, this all started shortly after I started using the shampoo, and only happened on the top portion of my scalp that I use Nizoral on (I use regular shampoo everywhere else). I googled this to see if there was any correlation, and I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s experienced this issue. It&#x27;s pretty upsetting. I&#x27;m halting use completely, but I can&#x27;t get my hair color back. I&#x27;d take dandruff over super premature graying any day :(</li>
    <li> BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even think twice. In the last few months for some reason I started getting dandruff, and it got so bad that I was thinking to see a doctor, which seemed silly but it was that bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried home remedies, nothing helped. Not tea tree oils or other treatments, not head&amp; shoulders. I decided to buy this one last thing, on a whim. And it was a miracle. After 3 washes (it smells great) all my dandruff was gone, and STAYED gone. The stuff is great. I really can&#x27;t believe it still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have EDTA and some other bad things for your hair, but many of the ingredients are in most shampoos anyway. I didn&#x27;t notice it hurting my hair in any way, and you shouldn&#x27;t need to use it for more than a week anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I had horrible dandruff flakes that were out of control and nothing worked.  The tar based dandruff shampoos worked but dried my hair out something awful.  This has been a regular staple.  I can tell when it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used it.  I do not use it every week, only when I feel the changes in my scalp.  When I first started buying this years ago I could readily find it in the local stores for around $7.99 now it&#x27;s doubled since the shortage.  I think it&#x27;s still worth it.  No dandruff and no dry hair breaking is a win win.  I hear it is good for thinning hair as well, hence the demand for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for dandruff! There is a stronger version, but required a prescription.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff since I was 17 and I tried dandruff shampoo from stores but they never worked on me. I&#x27;m wondering if this shampoo would work on me. Also has any one tried this Nizoral Anti Dandruff Shampoo and did it work? Cause I don&#x27;t know how well it works I never tried it before and want to.</li>
    <li> This is my second review for this product at Amazon.com.  After using this product continuosly for a decade and a half, I can affirm this is a wonderful medicated anti-dandruff shampoo.  I started out paying around US$12.75 for the 7 fl. oz bottle about 15 years ago.  Over the years, I saw its price kept climbing to the current non-sale price of between US$14.39 to US$20 for the same 7 fl. oz bottle( shop around for the better price ).  The product is now made Belgium.  Back in 2000 when I started to use this product, it was made in USA.  Couple years later, the production was transferred to Italy.  Some time around 2009/2010, the production was once again moved from Italy to Belgium.  Due to the production shift, this shampoo was in short supply around 2009/2010 and vendors sold the remaining stocks in their inventory at premium prices.  During this period, I had to purchase the 2% Nizoral shampoo version made in the UK also by McNeil.  The 2% Nizoral version was red in color( versus turquoise for the US 1% version ), had a thinner fluid constituency and in my opinion and experience did not worked as well as the 1% Nizoral US counterpart.  Now that the 1% Nizoral shampoo has been back into the US market for almost 3 years now and I am happy to find it at Amazon.com for the low price of US$14.39!  Great deal and good job Amazon.  Keep the1% Nizoral shampoo coming and keep its price low also.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite dandruff shampoo because it works!  So glad Amazon fulfills this antidandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Did NOTHING for me. MG217 is much, much better. I will be going back to that shampoo for my scalp issue.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the job.  Recommended by my dermatologist and helps keep the flakes away.  I use this along with a coal tar shampoo and a pyrithione zinc shampoo (rotating each week) and this combination works really well for me.</li>
    <li> It works like magic! !!! It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m able to find something that actually works in fighting dandruff! !</li>
    <li> Just another bottle of failed product. I have used it as it says and still have dandruff.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but does not get reed of the symptoms permanently.</li>
    <li> Already seeing results after one use. Great product for a dry scalp and saw less hair fall after shampooing. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!!! i used it twice and no dandruff appeared again :D</li>
    <li> I used this for my infant son&#x27;s cradle cap a few times and it cleared up so quickly. It also smells SO good!</li>
    <li> Product is wonderfull</li>
    <li> i have dandruff in my hair and beard tried every thing nothing worked untill nizoral  it works so good its almost unbeleveable i get dry skin on my face eye brows and fore head it even cured that this stuff realy works</li>
    <li> Worked okay, not great.  I still haven&#x27;t found a good shampoo that helps an itchy scalp.  They all work about the same.</li>
    <li> Formula has changed!  Leaves enormous amounts of Dandruff! I have two major issues: Dandruff and Price.  So last night, I went to Walmart to find a shampoo replacement because I was using a new bottle of the 7 oz Nizoral for over a week and it left me with a very itchy scalp and crazy amount of dandruff.  I&#x27;ve never had a dandruff problem and this shampoo is just the worst.  Additionally, this same 7 oz bottle is sold at Walmart for $5!  On Amazon, it is 3 X&#x27;s the price.  Do you yourself a favor, dont buy this product!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from terrible dandruff for well over 5 years. You name a dandruff product, treatment, regimen or remedy and I have probably tried it. I have never found anything that has completely cured my case of flakes except for nizoral. I am so happy I can shake my head and rub my hair and not see one flake. This product is such a blessing for me. Granted, everyone is different and different products work for different people. Nizoral just happens to be the product that helps me. I use a very small amount just once a week and that&#x27;s it! No mas caspa! Anyone that struggles with dandruff, I would suggest giving nizoral a shot. Compared to other shampoos nizoral is pricy, but I would gladly pay 3X the price for the product that I know works for me. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it, I would say go for it!</li>
    <li> I tried a few other high-rated anti-dandruff shampoos from Amazon for weeks with no good results, but Nizoral cleared it up in a single wash. I only need to use this stuff *maybe* once a week, if that.</li>
    <li> May be I&#x27;ve some other serious problem regarding dandruff but Nizoral has not been very effective.</li>
    <li> I heard great reviews about this product and will be testing it out for the next couple months. So far though it has reduced dandruff pretty substantially in a small time period. Blows the doors off anything like Head and Shoulders or CVS quality shampoo.</li>
    <li> This works. I&#x27;m African American and after a week of use my dandruff was gone.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about purchasing the shampoo because I usually buy T/Gel by Neutrogena every winter when my scalp gets dry but this product actually worked for me. It took a few washes to notice but it definitely helped with the flakey scalp and oil bumps. Also with itchiness!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff,  every winter, I get dry flaky skin on my scalp, ears, face, and neck...  nothing else worked from lotions to shampoos, nothing helped, until I forund this, its and amazing product that works great</li>
    <li> This is sort of odd for me to write a review of shampoo, but I have to let the world know that I FINALLY found a shampoo that stopped my flaking. I have tried everything (except prescriptions) and on occasion, Selsom Blue Medicated would work...but also trigger a lot of itching. After my wife got a prescription for the ingredient in Nizoral, I decided to try the non-prescription strength version. Within 3 days, flakes were gone. No itching. I can now use regular shampoo and perhaps once a week I&#x27;ll use Nizoral to maintain flake-free hair. Dark shirts here I come!</li>
    <li> Excellent I have gotten rid of my dandrift</li>
    <li> Been looking for this for a while,  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> This product needs a 6 stars review. I have to start saying that I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I have worked with top of the line products, including anti dandruff shampoos and treatments. This is the ONLY product that works.&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff is cause by a fungus that works similarly like a yeast infection. When there&#x27;s an imbalance the scalp reacts causing dandruff. Can be hair dyes, hair products, even stress.&lt;br /&gt;When you have a fungus you need an anti fungal medication and ketokonazole is that. There&#x27;s nothing else in the market without prescription that can help you out. Other known shampoos like the ones containing salicylic acid only exfoliates the scalp but can&#x27;t kill the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said that it made the dandruff worse after 1 or 2 shampoos and stopped using it. This is a TREATMENT, ideally you wash your hair 3 times a week with this shampoo for the first 2 weeks. You will see more flakes coming out the first 2 or 3 times, it means you are getting rid of it. And then less and less, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;For those that says it leaves the hair dry I tell them you only use this shampoo on the scalp, you don&#x27;t rub it on the ends. You can use your regular shampoo to mid shaft down. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> So far. the most effective of the many shampoos that I have tried.  And I have tried many.</li>
    <li> I have high hopes for this shampoo. I have used it once with NO improvement at all. My head is still itching like crazy and flaking the same as always. Others have said it takes a few washes to see an improvement, so I will keep you updated. But for now my rating is 3 stars. Because it does have a nice sent not medicated like most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this shampoo for the second time yesterday. I can notice a difference this time. No itching and almost no flakes! That&#x27;s the first time in years my scalp hasn&#x27;t itched like crazy after showering and flaking like crazy as my hair dries. This is definitely worth a 5 star review now. :)</li>
    <li> The only product over the counter that helps with my flakes.</li>
    <li> I hate washing or combing my hair would much rather hire someone else to do it.  I wash it reluctantly once every week, sometimes going longer if I&#x27;m lazy.  As a result, my scalp itched bad and dandruff was caked.  Other shampoos I&#x27;ve used have done a moderate job of keeping the dandruff at bay, Sebastian Drench, American Crew, Unite, Bumble and Bumble, Enjoy etc.  Then I ran out of my shampoo and went to Wally World and picked up some Pantene.  After using it, my hair was still caked with dandruff, where you scratch your scalp and thick gooey stuff is under your nails.  Not working so I had to throw it out.  I went back to Wally World to find Denorex, which I like, but they were out.  I came across Nizoral for $14.  I was reluctant to pay that much for shampoo at Walmart of all places, but I bought it, and I like it.  I parted my scalp about two days later and the scalp was just as nice and squeaky clean.  Will purchase again.  Keeping a clean scalp is essential to good hair growth.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for shampoo that does the same basic job as other products at a much lower price point.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awsome. I got it yesterday used it before work. Its the next day now and I havnt scratched my head once. The smell is so nice and fresh. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. This has to be the best shampoo I ever used just for the smell alone. It really dies work.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works very well to control dandruff, much better than most anti-dandruff shampoos.  Can&#x27;t beat the pricing here.</li>
    <li> Helps relieve and get rid of my daughters scalp psorisis  ..  and relieves my other kids dry scalp. With no burning and leaves hair silk smooth</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my brother but the package was damaged and one came all spilled</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos for dandruff or psoriasis..</li>
    <li> Shampoo works great - this is the third time i have purchased!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice.  I do like it. It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my dandruff, but it is the best thing I have found so far.  Head and Shoulders used to do the trick, but somehow it quit working and I needed to find something better.  I have done my research and this shampoo is the best I can find.  I bet if I used it everyday it would clear my dandruff completely, but it is on the expensive side, so I just use it to keep things under control.  I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> for my sister who has a dry hair</li>
    <li> I have mild eczema on my scalp, eyebrows, and beard and nothing I have ever tried worked; selenium sulfide, coal tar, pyrithione zinc, and salicylic acid.  I went to the doctor and was told to try out Nizoral so I bought a bottle and tried it out. After the first week of using it in my hair and on my face all my skin went into overdrive peeling off, which kind of worried me, but fresh skin never grew back its scaly layer. Two weeks after the first use and I didnt have a single flake anywhere.  I have short hair so it took me about three months to run out of the stuff at which point I thought &amp;#34;yay I&#x27;m cured&amp;#34; so I didnt immediately buy a bottle, and two weeks later the flaking was back.  Bought it again and went through the whole process again.  This stuff is freaking amazing, I highly highly highly recommend it to anyone when one or two of the others dont work, just remember once you start you don&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
    <li> So glad it&#x27;s back! Was extremely hard to get for a couple years. It&#x27;s the only thing that clears up my husbands scalp psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Dandruff shampoo I have ever used . Follow directions and it should eliminate any and all flakes</li>
    <li> Only used it twice thus far. I&#x27;m hoping for good results as I have used the product in the past.</li>
    <li> Only product that will cure my dandruff!!!</li>
    <li> great product and is the only thing that gets the dandruff gone and keeps it gone. Plus I don&#x27;t have to use it every day or even once a week!</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference after a week of use and after a week of non-use. Head and shoulders&#x27; strongest stuff was not nearly as effective as Nizoral.</li>
    <li> This is an extraordinarily effective shampoo for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as the last stop before going to a doctor as I had severe built-up dandruff that zinc-based shampoo didn&#x27;t affect. I even itched and flaked the day after washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit slow to work on me - I didn&#x27;t notice a real improvement for three weeks - but it did work where nothing else had. After six weeks my dandruff was fully suppressed. It hasn&#x27;t come back yet and it&#x27;s BEEN A YEAR since I used up the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the initial treatment period was over I continued to use this in maintenance mode, once a week, until I used up the whole bottle. I figured I&#x27;d paid for it and it has an expiration date. That may contribute to my good results. Do note that it&#x27;s designed to suppress yeast-based dandruff and if yours has a different cause you&#x27;ll need to try something else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as a shampoo, it&#x27;s very efficient. I found that a quarter teaspoon (1.5 ml) would properly lather medium-short hair (4 in / 10 cm) unless I&#x27;d been exercising heavily. That made it go a long way, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not buying it again is that it&#x27;s so good I don&#x27;t need to - a recommendation in itself.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product but it can be hard to find. It does work well and really cuts back on the dandruff.</li>
    <li> It works, but my hair falls even faster when I use this shampoo...</li>
    <li> best dandruff shampoo every. i had buildup from shampoos and conditioners for years and had the dandruff problem for many months. thanks to the very helpful reviews i purchased this. used it for a week about 5 months ago and i have never had a single dandruff flake since. i use this only occasionally now, about once a month just to keep my scalp treated. excellent product.</li>
    <li> it really works for me,  my dandruff situation considering to be minor comparing with some people that have been suffering from it. My only critics would be I am kinda relying on the product now and once i stop using it they come right back.</li>
    <li> After just less than a month of use at about twice a week, I can tell that the itching has subsided on my scalp and the hair shedding has reduced noticeably - the reason I bought this product in the first place.  Supposedly, the active ingredient helps to block DHT to stop abnormal hair shedding.  I need to give it more time, however, and perhaps watch how the other products I just bought helps with the cause.</li>
    <li> Good product for eliminating scalp seborrheic dermatitis</li>
    <li> I bought this because I heard it relieved itch due to scalp psoriasis and I have been searching for relief from this condition for years. Psoriasis causes really bad scaling and flaking which can be mistaken for dandruff. Unfortunately it did not help it at all. It never claimed to, so I don&#x27;t blame the product. I do have an otherwise dry scalp in the unaffected area and I certainly don&#x27;t have dandruff there so it must work! The smell is nice and like other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used. I have a shoulder length bob and have been skipping conditioner just to see if I can get away with it. Some shampoos are too drying to skip that step but this shampoo allows me to skip it.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nizoral religiously, so I almost feel bad lowering my review down to 2 stars, but a recent trip to my dermatologist was an eye opener for me. Nizoral was great in controlling my dandruff, even eliminating it a few days at a time. Lately, it hasn&#x27;t done much to put a dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist for an unrelated issue. After using this, I was convinced I needed a stronger dose (2% ketoconazol vs the 1% in the bottle). She quickly and disrespectfully interrupted me, but dammit she was right. Tar shampoo has eliminated my dandruff instead of simply controlling it! That&#x27;s how I wish this product would work, but alas my subscription to Nizoral shampoo has instead been cancelled.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps prevent dandruff and itchy scalp.  I have been very pleased using it every other day.</li>
    <li> does a great job on my hair</li>
    <li> Nothing else worked.  I even tried an expensive Redkin dandruff shampoo that didn&#x27;t work.  I would definitely recommend this if other, less expensive options don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> For the first time is a decade I have no flakes. I have tried it all. In fact, that&#x27;s why I bought this one. I had tried EVERY OTHER ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does make your hair feel plasticy or like a rug.. but WORTH IT.. my flakes were so bad it was like it was always snowing.. that&#x27;s gone. I hope it continues working!</li>
    <li> Love and it works, but it will dry out your hair. Small price to pay for a clean scalp though.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo twice now and i can say that it has made a real difference with my dandruff. I use it only once a week after my inital shampoo but before my conditioning. I am african American with 4b relaxed hair so I dont use it more than that due to moisture concerns. I apply a small amount to my head and let it marinate for a few minutes. I work the product in and then I rinse out. My dandruff is completely controlled.</li>
    <li> Undoubtedly, the best dandruff shampoo ever... been using for years now... buy it right now.. u wont b disappointed</li>
    <li> Forget Head &amp; Shoulders, because this is the only product you&#x27;ll need.  It works, I kid you not.  I have significantly less dandruff than before I used it and my barber has noticed as well.  There is a tiny bit of flaking, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s for every scalp.  I don&#x27;t regret buying this at all.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of scales on my scalp and dandruff. This product worked great with only two applications. I now it use about once a week. My hair is dryer when I use it but I compensate with a really good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo as a body wash as recommended by my doctor because I get a very mild case of tinea, a fungal infection. It contains ketaconazole, which is what the doctor gives me in pill form when I have an infection, and he recommends I use this shampoo on my body as a preventative measure. It has a very pleasant smell and is gentle enough to use everyday if needed. It is a good idea to try this for dandruff as well, especially if other dandruff shampoos haven&#x27;t worked for you in the past, because it contains a different ingredient than most dandruff shampoos. If your dandruff is caused by a fungal infection, this is definitely going to help you better than other brands.</li>
    <li> The only product I tried that works for my husband.  We&#x27;ve tried everything prior to this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for a long time. I don&#x27;t have dandruff and I&#x27;ve managed to keep a relatively full-looking head of hair for much longer than anyone expected. I think this stuff is partly to thank. It was rough going during the year plus shortage, but seems like inventory has stabilized. My hair follicles are thankful.</li>
    <li> Like many people I too suffer from dandruff problem. Sometimes It is so bad that if I have done shampoo in the morning, in evening itself I start noticing flakes again. Back in my home country, I had first tried Nizoral and we used to get 2 types there. Probably one was milder and another strong. This seems to be the milder version (strong one was red bottle). Many people say it is also water of a place which either worsens or betters the dandruff issue. In my case I feel it is sort of remained same. So when a deal popped up for nizoral, I immediately ordered it. This shampoo is definitely expensive than your run of the mill head and shoulder and such crap. But then if you want to actually use a shampoo that works (better), I strongly recommend Nizoral. As of writing this review, it is a Wednesday and I remember using this shampoo last week Friday or something and in between I have twice used generic shampoo and still I see no or very very less flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend using Nizoral for dandruff treatment, yes it will come back in few days but with this shampoo, it won&#x27;t come as soon as it will with H&amp;S and such other ones.&lt;br /&gt;And good part is that you don&#x27;t really need any prescription to get these.</li>
    <li> So my head had been itchy for a few weeks, I chalked it up to a dry winter. Then one morning I was drying my hair and kept smelling this awful fish odor, like the way your hands smell after you take the hook out of a fish you just caught. I smelled everything in my bathroom then got a wif of my hair, it was my hair! After googling I felt pretty sure that it was a yeast problem, I ran to walgreens and purchased this shampoo, it was the only shampoo I could find with an actual anti-fungal (ketoconazole) not just tar. I washed my hair with dawn first to eliminate any build up followed by this shampoo and it worked almost immediately. My scalp isn&#x27;t itching and my hair smells like hair products as it should!</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo if your scalp starts getting itchy; for whatever reason. It helped me quickly. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> use it to eliminate skin fungus. Does the job</li>
    <li> I use this for thin hair and it works. Takes some time but after loosing my hair to the dredded DHT I am seeing good results. It has taken about a year between using this and Rogain but growth is there. The Rogain by itself was mearly maintaining but not adding. Even the wife told me the other day it&#x27;s really coming back. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Expensive for its size.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I&#x27;ve found to control my son&#x27;s scalp problems.</li>
    <li> The best! My dandruff greatly lessened after two shampoos! The shampoo has a pleasant smell - no medicated smell at all. It is sort of a unisex smell, so don&#x27;t hesitate if you are a guy and just read that. I would imagine that results could vary, but I was plagued by itching and flaking during summer for years. No more! If you still have issues after using this, please see a doctor (dermatologist) - there could be some other things going on. For me, for now - I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, just received it less than a week, will write the review after using one month, the shampoo I bought it before, it was recommended by the doctor, as fas as the  biotin, after looking so many consumers reviews, I would like to give it a try, hope it can improve the strength of my nails and the problem of my growing grey hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me its about as good as any other dandruff shampoo I tried but costs more</li>
    <li> The best dandruff shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that truly works! I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones, even natural products, but it only was a temporary fix and then my scalp would get irritated and be flaky again. This product truly works! I had no idea yeast was the cause. Why is this the only brand that has this particular anti fungal? It&#x27;s not even American made. My guess is because it works and people don&#x27;t have to buy it over and over again...unlike those common products you see in the store. They want your $$. I highly recommend this product if others have failed you. Overgrowth of yeast on your scalp is the culprit. You will notice a difference in just 1-2 washes, but keep it up for some weeks and you&#x27;ll be flake and irritation free.</li>
    <li> Helps with my scalp condition and recommended by my Dermatologist. Don&#x27;t use it every day, which is what the instructions say, as it will give you some irritation.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for Seborrheic dermatitis</li>
    <li> No more dandruff. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Years of beard and head dandruff have come to an end. I&#x27;ve used this every 3-4 days for two weeks and after both of my first two uses I had a Massive Flaking Event (or a MFE, ;) ) with very large flakes of dandruff unlike any before. But a week later at least 90 percent of my chronic dandruff was no more. At the same time I started using a beard oil made from Argan and Jojoba to touch up dry patches around my beard, which were a bit more stubborn, and that&#x27;s been final touch. Amazing that this shampoo is so effective compared to Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue - at least for whatever skin condition I&#x27;ve had. Over two weeks of use now and I&#x27;m very optimistic that I&#x27;m golden as long as I keep using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> After trying almost everything for dandruff control, I had basically given up until I heard about this. Works amazing and is definitely worth a shot despite the high price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ideal to try after trying other cheaper products because the dandruff cause that nizoral seeks to cure is different from what any other products try and cure. So try the cheaper stuff (Selsun Blue etc.) first and if that doesn&#x27;t work, then give this a shot.</li>
    <li> Husband loves, fast shipping will purchase again</li>
    <li> This shampoo works as intended and controls flakiness and itching.  I have noticed that my hair is somewhat drier since beginning use of this product.</li>
    <li> The best anti-dandruff on the market. Smells decent and works great.</li>
    <li> Best anti-dandruff shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I guess everybody is differant but I have suffered with severe dandruff for 40 years....tried them all...prescription and over the counter and nothing cleaned it up like one bottle of Nixoral. For the first time, I am dandruff free...use it every third day in the shower. The secret is leaving it on for about five minutes before you rinse. Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> Thank you ;) the best price I have ever seen ;)</li>
    <li> I order this for my boyfriend and he seems to like it.</li>
    <li> So I used to have a bunch of flakes. Used this once per day and let it sit for a couple minutes each time and now I have no flakes! Cant explain it but it truly works! Must be that special chemical :D Says not to use for more than three weeks and I still have more than 3/4 of the bottle left!</li>
    <li> Works great!!! No presciption No doctor&#x27;s bill &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Simply love it. A perfect dandruff killer. its pricy but worth it.I use it twice in a week. I never feel dry after using it.Overall a good product to buy</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t have dandruff, i bought it its anti hair loss properties. No noticeable change.</li>
    <li> this shampoo smell amazing, and makes hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for hair loss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good thanks ^^*</li>
    <li> This does exactly what we needed it to do when absolutely no other anti-dandruff shampoo will work. This gets the job done. This was our last shot before we went prescription strength. Thankfully this is the best and strongest anti-dandruff on the market.</li>
    <li> I had dry scalp problems but it wasn&#x27;t horrible until January of this year after I put a perm in my hair. I hadn&#x27;t used one in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this my scalp became SO dry. It was so bad I could wash it 2 or 3 times in a row and still see dry patches. I had to take a comb and scrape my whole entire head to clear my scalp. I&#x27;d have to wash it again and then spend over and hour getting all the dandruff that was now stuck in my hair with a comb. I HATED this process and it made me lose so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really curly African American hair but it&#x27;s curly to the point some people thinking I&#x27;m Hispanic (trying to paint of picture of the texture). Since I have curly hair the flakes would just stay stuck in my curls and I could not get it out with just washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff in my hair for the first time. I left it on about 20 mins, washed it off and then washed it regularly one more time. I didn&#x27;t condition my hair or anything. I noticed my scalp felt so different. No more itching, no more scratching and WAY less dandruff. I&#x27;d have to say after my second time using it, I didn&#x27;t see ANY dandruff anymore. It was like my scalp was back to normal again. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I spent almost 6 months being miserable and so many times I didn&#x27;t go out the house because my scalp was so bad and it would take about two hours to get it clean. It was this flaky dandruff that looked like huge big flakes of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff didn&#x27;t dry my hair out and I noticed my hair stopped falling out too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say after a months use of maybe 8 times (letting it soak in my scalp for awhile and wash it again) I stopped using it. I don&#x27;t have dandruff for about a whole month. Then it started coming back but not really bad. I quickly bought some more to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would never see the day that I could just wash my hair, put some hair lotion in it and go. This stuff gave me my life back. I missed out on so much not wanting to go out because of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was all natural ingredients because I try to use stuff without any chemicals. I made an exception because I was desperate and this definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try it! I bought mine for $11.94...don&#x27;t let anyone charge you more than $15 for it. They sell this at Walmart for that price. I saw one person charging about $30 something for one bottle. That&#x27;s crazy.</li>
    <li> My daughter had terrible dandruff and none of the dandruff shampoos were helping - she ALWAYS had tons of white flakes on her black hair and it looked terrible.  This shampoo took care of the problem with the first shampooing - just amazing and oh so wonderful!!! So glad we found it.  Selsun Blue works great for me, but it did nothing for my daughter&#x27;s problem - Nizoral is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well for taming an irritated scalp and I haven&#x27;t noticed any dandruff since using it.  Be sure to follow the directions on how to use properly to get the full benefits.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Good AntiDandruff Shampoo</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t leave five stars for just any product. It has to be something I can recommend and by again in the future. This is that item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo makes my hair strong and smell amazing. I never noticed such a difference in my hair. I have middle eastern (Turkish decent) hair, and at the age of 25, I have never felt my hair so full and rich. It&#x27;s truly my favorite shampoo to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. I&#x27;m 26 going on on 27 soon and I regret that I stopped using this product. I stopped to use other shampoo and conditioners since I fear I am losing hair at an early hair. Baldness runs in my family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started using other products it wasn&#x27;t the same. Hair still fell out or it didn&#x27;t feel as strong. I tried many different ones but at the end of the day, I feel this was the only product that lessened my hair loss and increased strength.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product but not with how it arrived! The bottle was open and some of it spilled out, I lost probably about 1/4 of the bottle and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> ultil now my head feels les itchy and my hair stopped falling in big quantities</li>
    <li> If you have a problem with dry scalp or dandruff this stuff is great. I&#x27;ve tried other dry scalp/dandruff shampoos and they NEVER work as good as this! This is the best stuff on the market</li>
    <li> excellent! dandruff decreases and feel less pruritus</li>
    <li> Definitely notice a difference since using it and you only need to wash with it twice a week. We&#x27;ll worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product no dandruff after a week use</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I  apply once per week.</li>
    <li> This is the only one that really works I know!! Using it only ones in a while for about 17 years! always works!</li>
    <li> Took a little while to work (2 weeks of alternate day use), but it is super effective after that period of time. I had usual dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. This thing completely eliminated those. I have not discontinued its use, so I don&#x27;t know if or when the condition will return after discontinuation of Nizoral. I don&#x27;t know how it worked but some of the seborrheic dermatitis was effecting my nose and ear areas too. It eliminated even that and I of course didn&#x27;t apply it to my face. I think it just did it by accidental contact with the effected skin.</li>
    <li> Not only has this shampoo helped with a ringworm infection in my scalp, but it actually gives my hair a lot of body...something I didn&#x27;t expect from a medicated shampoo. It&#x27;s a tad expensive, but it has really helped with the itch of this infection. In fact, it&#x27;s gone, and hopefully I&#x27;m on the road to recovery.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I purchased it for hair loss as apposed to dandruff. Its supposed to help block DHT which is a primary cause for hair loss. I will purchase this again because it does clean your hair better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Only thing I dislike is the small amount for the cost. 7 oz for $14 is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Just wish the bottle were bigger.</li>
    <li> I used to use Dandrene and it was great.  But they changed their formulation and it stopped working.  I use this now once a week and I am flake free again.  Suffered for chronic dandruff most of my life.  This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Nizoral has improved the health of my scalp. I started using this because I can smell yeast on my scalp, and I was losing hair. It made sense for me to cure the dandruff before I try hair products for growth.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works even a little bit to control my dandruff. Not the cure that I&#x27;m looking for, but better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, even prescription.</li>
    <li> Helps relieve a &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; scalp after straightening and coloring.  Best product I have tried, and there have been many.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my dandruff at all. If it did, I didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> Best antidandruff shampoo I can find.</li>
    <li> I bought my son one in the past year. He feels clean.</li>
    <li> Best $15 I ever spent. The incessant itchy scalp and endless white &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; were really starting to make me feel down and hopeless. I had tried Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue, and the Neutrogena products T/Gel and T/Sal, which were recommended by my doctor. Still, my head felt like it had an itchy fungus ): Finally, I turned to Amazon, and selected Nizoral based on customer reviews. I wanted to try it immediately, so I actually went and bought it at Target for an identical or similar price. Bonus: It doesn&#x27;t smell bad! It&#x27;s pretty neutral.</li>
    <li> It really works!!!!! no dandruff and itchy anymore! just a bit pricy...</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I have tried that brings instant relief to an itchy scalp. I always have a bottle of this shampoo because it works so well.</li>
    <li> Hands down best AntiDandruff shampoo out there.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really cured the itch. But too expensive to keep buying.</li>
    <li> I paid $25 for a bottle here on Amazon less than one month ago. Today its selling for $12 so I&#x27;m stocking up. Strange price swings for any product much less a shampoo.  Anyway, I use this as part of a hair loss prevention protocol along with Finasteride and Topical Spironolactone S5. Nizoral is primarily an antifungal shampoo that also has androgen blocking properties. This makes it an effective anti-inflammatory for hair loss sufferers. What is an androgen blocker? Hair thins because of hormone activity in your scalp. Androgen blockers inhibit those processes. I&#x27;ve been using for a month and so far, so good. You can read more online...I frequent Hairlosstalk.com for an interesting read.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have tried all kinds of salon shampoos, dandruff shampoos, and home remedies like olive oil, baking soda, and apple cider vinegar. But nothing has cleared up my chronic dandruff like this stuff. I was very skeptical it would work because everyone recommends different things that have all failed but this stuff has worked miracles on my head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing for me, after trying many shampoos and paying huge money to doctors it was my last shampoo I use and ordered it from Amazon .</li>
