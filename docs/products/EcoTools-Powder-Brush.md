<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bristles of this brush are incredibly soft and dense, which makes my liquid foundation buff into my skin smoothly and evenly. Amazon Prime&#x27;s price is more expensive than if you find this brush at the store, but less expensive than if you buy it through the EcoTools website. The only issue is that the brush head diameter is a bit on the small side (a little larger than a quarter). Also, the packaging made the brush smell like elephant poo (which went away after washing it).</li>
    <li> Has the right denseness for powder foundation.  Very soft bristles, I am so in love with these brushes.  It comes with two which is great because while one is drying you can use a fresh brush.  No fallen bristles even through washes.  WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes soooo much!!! They&#x27;re great for applying liquid and powder foundations. It gives liquid foundations a very airbrushed look and blends like a dream. Theyre SUPER soft too.</li>
    <li> and i will never be without one again!  came in a 2 pack and i use it every day!  I use it for liquid foundation application and it goes on smooth and even every time!!</li>
    <li> Ce pinceau est vraiment tr&amp;eacute;s pratique pour la poudre min&amp;eacute;rale. En plus il se lave tr&amp;eacute;s bien et les pooils en taklon sont tr&amp;eacute;s agr&amp;eacute;able sur le visage.</li>
    <li> I used this brush twice and it is really good quality. Comparable to sigmas F80. I&#x27;m going to buy the whole set.</li>
    <li> it is nice and soft and i like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;and i will recommend it to my friends, it is worthy</li>
    <li> Super soft, yet sturdy enough to actually buff powder or liquid in.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Hands down THE BEST brushes I&#x27;ve used for my makeup. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup (mainly a BB cream and mascara) so I always hated spending $60+ dollars on brushes. These are really good quality, easy to clean, and eco-friendly.</li>
    <li> I love all the Eco Tools brushes.  This buffing brush is great for foundation &amp; allows for good control over how much coverage you want.  I&#x27;ve used it with liquid &amp; cream foundation &amp; I&#x27;ve even used it to apply concealer under my eyes.  It&#x27;s very soft, but dense, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t shed. It&#x27;s a great buy &amp; probably just as good as those really expensive Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush because it is excellent quality, doesn&#x27;t shed and has lasted me quite some time. I use it to buff my MAC pro sculpting cream to ensure that there aren&#x27;t any noticeable lines and to blend a cream blush that I use daily (you have to get used to the different flat top). I haven&#x27;t used it for my foundation yet, but I will buy this brush again just for that as I&#x27;m sure it will blend smoothly. Bristles are dense and the handle is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I LOVE all the Eco Tools.  But these Buffing Brushes came in a pack of two, so it was great to get two quality brushes.  I use one while I&#x27;m cleaning/drying the other.  It&#x27;s important to clean these brushes each time if using liquid foundation or highlighter.  These brushes are ULTRA SILKY, so they are wonderful to use and easy to clean.  I have not had one errant bristle shedding!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, always a five star when it comes to the Eco tools brand. They do not irritate my face like cheaper brushes do.</li>
    <li> i purchased 2 brushes and there great i use them only for my liquid chanel highlighter it treally blends great  you will not go wrong with these brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works. I don&#x27;t know if it gives a airbrush finish. I like it. Worth a try to judge for yourself.</li>
    <li> My new foundation brush! I love this brush. I was using the elf flat foundation brush and it was ok but this brush is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t waste my expensive makeup, it&#x27;s all natural, and it applies my foundation better than any other way I have tried. It really blends well and gets into all those nooks. And the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> it is ok, but I have other brushes that works so much better and cheaper, this brush is little too soft if this is the right word to describe it, I am a true lover of Eco Tools brushes, but this particular one , is not that good. let me try to explain it, when blending the foundation with this brush, the brush bend too much, is like is not thick enough? not enough precision? I hope you get me, any way I found a nice use for it, when I put on my concealer or my foundation with my other brush, I use this one to smooth it out under my eye and all over my face, to get a nice clean finish, kind of like if this was a powder brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft, which I love since I have dry, sensitive skin. I was using brushes made with goat hair prior to this one, and they were so rough and made my face sting after buffing on my mineral makeup. Plus, synthetic brushes are the most animal-friendly brushes you can get, which is important to me. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five was due to the fact that these brushes, while soft, are not very firm. They do bend a bit and sort of splay as you are buffing. Still looking for a perfect buffing brush, but for now this one will suffice.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or a brush expert but I can&#x27;t see paying for a high-end brush when something like this does the job.  I use is to apply foundation and it works great.  It&#x27;s dense but soft so it doesn&#x27;t leave bristle marks.  It comes with it&#x27;s own case which is great because I don&#x27;t like having a brush sitting in a container exposed to dust and whatever else is floating around in the air.  You get 2 which is also great because you can use one for liquid foundation and the other for mineral or you&#x27;ll at least have a clean brush available when you wash the other.  I personally prefer this brush over the flat foundation brush that some people like.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the length of the handle.  It won&#x27;t bother other people, I&#x27;m sure, but I wish it was just a little shorter because it sometimes gets in my way.</li>
    <li> Good price for a nice brush! I bought two and I&#x27;m glad I did! I use one for my Jane Iredale mineral base and the other for a bronzer brush.</li>
    <li> I love EcoTools brushes. I have many of them. They are a great quality for the price. None of the bristle fall  out and there are gentle on your skin. I bought this one to apply foundation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for foundation. The brush absorbs a lot of product so I use a lot more foundation than I would with a regular foundation brush. I think it would be better for powder products.</li>
    <li> I used to apply my liquid foundation with a make-up sponge.  Well guess what?  That make-up sponge did what sponges are known for:  it SOAKED up all my make-up.  Stupid me, I did this for years.  I started watching the Pixiwoo channel on Youtube and I noticed that the girls always used brushes to apply their liquid foundation, and often used a buffing brush.  I bought this because I really love all my Ecotools that I already have in my collection.  Well, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  With this brush a little foundation goes a long way!  Also, This allows me to control the amount of coverage I want, anywhere to light and natural to completely flawless finish!  I love love love that it gives me an even and photo-ready finish.  And as expected from Ecotools, the quality is unbeatable.  The bamboo handles are strong and the bristles are soft and NEVER shed!!!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  And this two pack is a great deal.  Recommend to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Love the ecotools! Came as double just as described. Super soft bristles!</li>
    <li> I love EcoTools, I have purchased the eye shadow brushes before and they are super soft and does a great job. This brush is perfect for evening out my liquid foundation and feels just as soft. Definitely buying more of EcoTools in the future.</li>
    <li> high quality, durable and works so well plus its ecologically friendly and not expensive, I have the whole set and it&#x27;s more economical to purchase from the US.</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought this, I use this for the foundation, after I apply the foundation, which is just a little, then I apply the powder on both in circular motions. I am really glad I bought this and I love this line.</li>
    <li> very good . was excatcly what i order. very good quality . i will order more soon and price are good</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! I was hesitant to buy it because I already had a brush for my liquid foundation, but this does a wayyyy better job. It&#x27;s great that it comes with two as well! I use it with my foundation and it smooths it on so evenly my skin looks flawless</li>
    <li> I love Eco Tools and use many of their brushes. I have not been using this particular brush for very long, so I have not had the problem other reviewers have had with them. However, I will say that with just a tiny bit of makeup the finished look of my skin is so smooth that I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if the brush only lasted a short while. It gave my face (which is acne prone and has several acne scars) a sort of airbrushed look and covers my many blemishes. I never thought my skin could look like this. It looks beautiful. Even my husband loves the way it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup at all. Plus, it comes in a pack of two so I have a backup.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that I was buying a pack of 2, so I was very pleasantly surprised! After deeply considering buying MAC or Sigma brushes, I guess I forgot how inexpensive EcoTools brushes are and thought I was only purchasing one.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s perfect for using both mineral and liquid foundation - I get excellent coverage and even application. It did seem like the brush soaked up a little more of the liquid foundation but I&#x27;m not using a crazy expensive brand so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Washed them at least 4-5 times by now and they&#x27;re holding up really well. No shedding and they&#x27;re holding their shape - I never let them lay on a towel or the counter while they dry, I&#x27;ve ruined some good brushes that way.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow one single hair didn&#x27;t get trimmed correctly on one brush - it was sticking out of the middle, almost dead center. I tried yanking it out but it is firmly in there! I just trimmed it myself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, EcoTools makes a very competitive product that I love for its performance and the cruelty-free, sustainable origins. As I said in the title, I&#x27;m keeping these until they fall apart and then I&#x27;m buying them again.</li>
    <li> This brush has really held up well, it&#x27;s soft, easy to use, the ergonomic handle makes it easy hold and it applies makeup seamlessly.  This is a wonderful brush.</li>
    <li> Blends well, and is so soft! Great buy! Would definitely recommend to another, and would purchase again! I&#x27;m very happy with this brush!</li>
    <li> Love ecoTools brushes. I use this to apply bb cream, flawlessly i might add</li>
    <li> I usually like Ecotools a lot but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this brush in particular. It needs a lot of maintenance I&#x27;ve found. No matter what product I use with it, it will need to be cleaned within about three or four uses. So once a week (at the least!) or the distribution of product on my face is terrible. Its very hard to wash too. It need about twice the amount of brush cleaner compared to my other brushes. Next time I will just buy a twenty dollar brush because this one really isn&#x27;t worth the hassle. For what you pay though it&#x27;d okay to have as a spare.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and I love it, it applies my powder make up really nicely. I would totally recommended it</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes that feel much more expensive than they are! Super soft and don&#x27;t fray or shed. Great at blending and giving an airbrushed look.</li>
    <li> Love this brand!  This flat top buffing brush works great for foundation to create a flawless finish.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this brand and brush before purchasing a more expensive one, because it&#x27;s works perfect!</li>
    <li> Great buffing, soft, easy to clean. Great buy for an inexpensive brand. Goes the job and feels amazing on your face!</li>
    <li> I love EcoTools brushes. They work just as well as the few higher end brushes I own for a much lower price. I love that the company is environmentally friendly. I use these brushes for my foundation and my cream blushes. Works beautifully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type of picky reviewer that points every little detail wrong with a product blah blah blah. I got this at my local walmart because I was in need of a buffer brush, actually that beings first buffer brush.&lt;br /&gt;as a foundation brush, it gets the job done and buffs really well. Unfortunately, after a bit of usage (about 4 months or so) a lot of the hairs started falling out. it&#x27;s not like every swipe on your face a hair would appear, but definitely sole fall out.&lt;br /&gt;As a foundation brush overall, I really loved this and definitely recommend for first-time foundation users. considering it is an Eco-friendly brand with the softest hairs ever!! but if you&#x27;re a person in need a of a professional quality brush, then I&#x27;d recommend either sigma, or the Royal Care 4-piece foundation brush set which I give a 100% best review on!</li>
    <li> I am a avid lover of Eco Tools. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the hairs coming out onto my face or them not standing up to a lot of use and cleaning. This tool however as a &amp;#34;buffing brush&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t as sturdy as I like. I use it for a highlighting brush and it works well for that.</li>
    <li> I bought the EcoTools 6 pc Makeup Brush Set from Amazon but needed a foundation brush. I recently went to MAC and they used this style of brush to put the foundation on so when I saw it on Amazon, I bought it. It&#x27;s a great product that allow you to really blend in your foundation. The brush is very soft and the fact that I got two is a bonus!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite brushes for applying my foundation. Definitely better than that over rated beauty blending sponge. And they&#x27;re so soft yet firm too. 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I like this brush very much, i use it when applying liqued foundation and it is perfect and very very soft</li>
    <li> The best brush i use on my face. the bristles are soft and it feels great.</li>
    <li> For the price of two I was very impressed with the softness of this brush. Makes me question prices and materials a lot more!! Saves time as well as my foundation.</li>
    <li> I still have this brush after buying it a while back. Hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs or fallen apart. Well made. I am happy with this brush and how it applies bronzer and powders. I would recommend it as a good \\&quot;Green\\&quot; make up tool.</li>
    <li> Super soft. One of my favorite brushes for blending in foundation - no brush lines and it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the product. I am also glad its cruelty free.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect buffing brush. It gives your total control and allows you to get full coverage whether it is liquid foundation, powder, or just to blend all your makeup. Must have for any makeup lover!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as an impulse buy. And I can&#x27;t imagine putting on my makeup without it. Not only does it give a great airbrush finish it is so soft going on. It does not shred. So no more picking hairs from your face after you apply your foundation. The price is great it is worth way more than what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my MAC foundation since the make-up sponges soaked up too much product, and they didn&#x27;t blend well. I love this. It helps me lightly build coverage, and it blends very well. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Dont waste ur money with other brushes out there.. this is inexpensive brush with really HIGH QUALITY! I will never buy another brand! I love all the pencils that I bought from Ecotools.</li>
    <li> These brushed are the bomb!</li>
    <li> I generally like this product. I&#x27;m looking for a dense brush that can be used for liquid foundation or BB cream on a daily basis. I have my e.l.f $3 brush and it works very well to apply liquid foundation though it&#x27;s a powder brush thanks to how dense it is. But it&#x27;s a bit big for my face so I want to get a smaller one. I&#x27;ve searched in Sephora and other online stores such as Morphe brushes, Shopvioletvoss, to Missha, and other Korean cosmetic brands. Most of them have the same liquid foundation brush which is not round and dense but hard and flat. So I looked around on Amazon and thought I may try this one. It came the next day though it was 2 day shipping. Very fast! And I got 2 brushes in one pack and they were both still intact when I got them. Have tried them on everyday since then and I like how they feel. They are definitely softer than the e.l.f brush but still apply my liquid foundation evenly , doesn&#x27;t leave strokes on my face. They are smaller than the e.l.f one so they can actually get to the corners of my face better without spreading the foundation on my hair. However, I cleaned them today (clean my brushes once a week) and noticed a little bristle-fall-out from one of the two brushes. I&#x27;ll see how long they last but hopefully they&#x27;ll serve me for a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for foundation. I use this tool every day, still together after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This brush is worth every cent.  I really like it.  I use it to apply my bb cream and it leaves such a smooth finish.  I difinitely recommend you add this to your makeup collection.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using fingers, sponges and round mineral brushes to apply my liquid and powder foundations. I had heard some good things about brushes with this shape, but I wasn&#x27;t finding many reviews for these specific brushes. I already have a bunch of ecotools, and with the 2-for-cheaper-than-ulta price, I jumped on it, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I initially pulled the brushes out of their pouches, I thought, :-/ boo these are too soft. But they hold up well to use, and the shape remains intact as I move around my face. These brushes are either deceptively dense (which i doubt) or are just bound very well in the ferrule. Either way, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one to stipple and buff a layer of liquid foundation, and a repeat the process on problem areas. I use the second one to buff on some loose powder to set my foundation. To use a phrase-- my face looks totally airbrushed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about buying a second set because they&#x27;ve quickly become my most used brushes, and sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to wash my brushes every day. A++ would buy again, these are a total steal.</li>
