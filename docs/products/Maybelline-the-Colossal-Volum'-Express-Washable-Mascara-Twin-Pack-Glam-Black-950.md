<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do like this product but i thought i would want to buy it again and i just dont. It has this funky smell to it, which almost makes me not want to put it on. It does give a nice cover on the lash but i guess its just not for me.</li>
    <li> This mascara is my favorite from maybelline. It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake. I haven&#x27;t tried the eyeliner yet. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This product came in three days, i was very excited mostly for the Eye liner, as i have tried the mascara previously. i gave this product three stars because the actual mascara wasn&#x27;t my favorite that ive every owned but it works and i&#x27;ll still wear it. the eye liner however i was very happy about! It was just the right texture, color, and shape. I will defiantly be using this one everyday!</li>
    <li> Great combo of products, mascara lengthens the lashes and washes off easy. Liner glides on easy and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara. Its my favorite.</li>
    <li> I really liked the mascara, gives length and volume to my lashes. And the eyeliner very good as well, good color pay off and stayin power. It didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner ran out very quickly, due to the fact that it kept breaking every time I used it.  I love the mascara, but it makes my eyelashes stick together more than any mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Oh well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara and the price isn&#x27;t too bad. The eyeliner on the other hand isn&#x27;t that great. Mine kept breaking off everytime I tried using it</li>
    <li> I love this mascara so much. The price is amazing.The shipping didn&#x27;t take long at all. I love the eyeliner and everything else about it. Definitely worth my money.</li>
    <li> I love the feel when applying, it does not smudge although sometimes it can get really thick,thanks maybeline, will want more volume though</li>
    <li> Love the combo it  what I was looking for will buy again ! Been looking for a good creamy eyeliner pencil and it stays long all day and the mascara brings volume to my eyelashes love it !!!</li>
    <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t do much for my top lashes except clump them all together. So I only use for my bottom lashes. And the eyelines is perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a really long time now and with a few coats your lashes look huge!</li>
    <li> like it because you only have to put one coat on</li>
    <li> I like this Mascara and the liner, the package came in handy. the mascara is very smooth and gives a nice volume. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> greaaaattt!!!!! loved it c; it is very good and useful I really love it! really great price btw . just love it</li>
    <li> I am really impressed, I always use to buy the little mini Lancome Definicils on Ebay, and I thought I would try Maybelline just for grins, I&#x27;ve tried their other lines also, but this one I am happy most with, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t take multiple coats to get the look I want to really make my eyes stand out, and love that it washes off with soap and water.  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> the mascara clums a lot and dries really quickly so I can&#x27;t put on another coat without it looking like a clumped up mess but it does add a lot of volume. I wasn&#x27;t that much of a fan of the eyeliner since it smudged so bad for me. it went on amazing but as the day went on, it would fade and I&#x27;d look like a panda.</li>
    <li> well , my wife bought this and she is very happy with this purchase , and its also waterproof , it last all day long</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is good.Though the mascara is nothing special it bascally just makes your eyelashes black  lol and it does clump too!</li>
    <li> This mascara does a great job at lengthing and thickening my very thin sparse eyelashes. I recommend it. The brush is great.</li>
    <li> Good deal here on Amazon. As for the product itself, the eyeliner comes off waaaay too easily. The mascara was good though.</li>
    <li> great color and i loved it!! i ended up giving it to my teenage granddaughter because she loved it so much!! excellent price, too.</li>
    <li> this is a good brand of mascara everyone should consider buying this product i started using this a a teenager and still using this product</li>
    <li> Its my favorite mascara...and for the price and the fact that it comes with free eyeliner...well it was a great deal!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is wonderful and the mascara is my new fav! I wish I would have found this sooner! :)</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and eyeliner! Mascara lengthens and volumises, and the eyeliner is so pigmented! I love using it on my water line, it stays there all day, and doesn&#x27;t ball up in my tearduct. And it&#x27;s so affordable! Not a bad thing to say about this product!</li>
    <li> It was ok but wasn&#x27;t cheaper than going to store for it lol. Very strong smell though, I&#x27;ve used mascara with lighter smells than this one.</li>
    <li> The mascara is good, does have a mild chemical/floral smell. Not impressed with the liner. I&#x27;ve worn it quite a bit and it seems like it always runs/rubs off without provocation.</li>
    <li> great product  works very well would recc. anytime  actually held up to the exspensive brands that i have tried. will always buy</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. When I bought it I paid $4.06 for both the eyeliner and mascara (dual pack) which was a really, really great deal. When I saw the price I thought it was too good to be true so I only ordered one but now I am wishing I bought a bunch more. In fact, they started selling it like a pack like this again but I&#x27;m waiting for them to sell it cheaper because it&#x27;s currently $10 for the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliner: I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my eyeliner running during the day or coming off my eyes. This isn&#x27;t the case with this eyeliner at all. It seriously stays on all day but comes off easily at night. It&#x27;s very easy to use (no sharpening) and goes on really easily. I use it on my lower lid but I&#x27;m sure it would look and work great on the top too. Definitely the best eyeliner I have ever owned. Of course, you can buy it separately but it would cost you around $5-6 so definitely a deal right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara: I&#x27;ve tried quite a few mascaras and I was using a kind by avon for a while but I have certainly switched since using this one. It stays on good all day just like the eyeliner. It&#x27;s really black, dark, and doesn&#x27;t clump when you put it on. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and there&#x27;s still a lot left and it hasn&#x27;t dried up which you cannot really say about most mascaras. It comes off easily with water in the shower but doesn&#x27;t rub off from daily wear. This mascara alone goes for $12 in the drugstores around my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. I wish I would have bought probably another 3 or 4 when it was on sale. Cheap, came quick, and great quality. BUY BUY BUY, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!! :)</li>
    <li> Now my eyes look better. I wear always with me this and have a great opportunity to change myself on better way</li>
    <li> Maybelline This is a good value, goes on easy, and looks good on.  I will order this again and again.</li>
    <li> for a couple years this is the only eyeliner and mascara I&#x60;d use! in department stores this background  is usually 9-13 bucks! so glad I found it here cheaper. the eyeliner never runs whether you use it on the top or the bottom and compared to all the maybelline mascara this one is my favorite it really holds volume.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the cap off of the eyeliner, a chunk of it fell off. It claims to be smudge poof, but it smudged like crazy. Not worth the money. The delivery date was stupid. I got a text saying it was gonna come tomorrow &amp;it came like 3 days later.</li>
    <li> Loved how it added length and thickness to my lashes! Love this product! The eye liner stays on all dat dont fade like other brands.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was around $3.60 and gotta say I love it. The eye liner is wonderful and I use the mascara almost daily.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best i have ever had! It works so well and doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps behind. It gives my lashes so much volume and makes them took 2 times longer. After i got this all of my friends wanted it and they couldnt believe i got it from amazon. The eyeliner works very well and goes on easily. However, because the eyeliner is water proof, it takes FOREVER to take off.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent price...but the product was old. The very first time I used it, it was flaking off of my eyes. :-(</li>
    <li> Love this set. Much cheaper than buying eyeliner and mascara separately. I received my shipment quickly!!👍</li>
    <li> Love this mascara make my lashes so long and ice! It was nice that the eye liner came with it too! Both of these stay on very well!</li>
    <li> This mascara and eyeliner are both great! I will order another! They make your eyes and lashes really pop and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. The company is also great and they shipped the product before the expected time. I will recommend this for future purchases.</li>
    <li> This was not only a fantastic deal but I love the product. It gives me longer fuller lashes without clumping.</li>
    <li> Looks good when you first apply it but you find tiny clumps and residue within an hour or two under the eyes. I will be sticking with the blue volumexpress which seems to be unbeatable from EVERY other kind of mascara that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it is the best mascara I have ever tried on. I seriously recomend it. At least for me it works perfectly. I got the eyeliner too and Its great, Im so glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it lengthens ur eyelashes and makes ur eyes pop!&lt;br /&gt;Just clumps up a bit!! Ill buy it again tho! And i love the eyeliner its perfect all 5 stars for tht!</li>
    <li> It works good for me. It does kind of have a weird smell. I was delightfully surprised when i saw it came with eyeliner.</li>
    <li> both holds up great after a while. i am very satisfied with this purchase . The price wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and eye liner ..Love it ...it went on smooth and easy to apply the eyeliner love it</li>
    <li> It makes your lashes look longer, true. Only issue I have with it is the strong smell (which you can&#x27;t really smell once its applied on your lashes, but as your putting it on its pretty strong) and also if you have it on for a long day it starts to fall beneath your eyes giving you an &amp;#34;eye bag&amp;#34; look. Other than that its pretty good, not bad.</li>
    <li> The mascara is great mascare but it smells sooo weird and I was kind of afraid to use it until a friend showed me hers of the same brand smelled th same. It makes your lashes huge but the eye liner is TERRIBLE. It goes on really smooth but it smears and smudges worse than any eye liner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Two very nice products packed together.  Eyeliner is soft and very black it goes on great, one of these products is worth the cost alone.</li>
    <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t dry out easily, and is easy to use. 5/5 for the Mascara on it&#x27;s own. The eyeliner goes on smoothly but does tend to break off. Other than that, they are both great and are highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I only bought this for the mascara which I&#x27;ve used in the past &amp; love. I gave the eyeliner a try &amp; was absolutely ASTOUNDED- it&#x27;s so GREAT! Without fail, I&#x27;ve had problems with eyeliners (especially pencil) running down my face &amp; collecting in creases &amp; even disappearing into thin air off of my eyes minutes after I apply it. This one however, stays in place with minimal running &amp; smudging. It&#x27;s easy to remove too which is great for the sensitive skin around the eyes. It&#x27;s definitely worth it- AND the whole thing costs half as much as one of these mascaras normally would. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. Thanks to the seller!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara by far! I love it only kind I use and will only use for the rest of my life</li>
    <li> makes my lashes look full &amp; washes off easily with soap &amp; water.  I&#x27;ll buy this again &amp; will reccommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup wearer .. But I love my mascara&#x27;s ! This is deff a great mascara worth the money .</li>
    <li> The packaging looks to be quite old and I don&#x27;t know if the product is out of date. Not Impressed at all with my purchase. I would never have ordered if I had known. I will contact the manufacturer to find out if the product is out of date.</li>
    <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
    <li> The mascara works great. It wasn&#x27;t old, like some other reviews implied. I like it better than the expensive mascara I bought at the Sephora store, the last time I bought mascara. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend.  Let the first coat dry and apply again, they do make your lashes look &amp; seem longer!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Thanks so much :)</li>
    <li> Love the mascara but a little disappointed in the eyeliner.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on all day.  Great packaging and will probably continue to buy the mascara.</li>
