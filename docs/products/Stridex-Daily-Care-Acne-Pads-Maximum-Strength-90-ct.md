      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but it seems it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
      <li>be sure to moisturize</li>
      <li>Love the product, but I was under the impression that I would receive two of these...</li>
      <li>Dunno why this has so many 5 star reviews.</li>
      <li>All the money I&#x27;ve been wasting on overpriced products and Stridex works wonders :)</li>
      <li>Anything that is multi use is OK by me.</li>
      <li>Cheap, effective product</li>
      <li>Make sure to give the product some time to settle in before putting on moisturizers, etc.</li>
      <li>The best thing that&#x27;s happened to my face in a long time.</li>
      <li>This product is fine, but there&#x27;s definitely better brands with better deals.</li>
      <li>My 18 year old son doesn&#x27;t feel Stridex works that great.  </li>
      <li>Overall, ive been using this method for close to a month, or more, and this has been a great buy for me.</li>
      <li>Leaves my faces feeling clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and has done wonders for my skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to use yet</li>
      <li>These Stridex pads are easy to use, and help keep my acne at bay.</li>
      <li>maybe it&#x27;s the menthol (which is quite strong).</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest using moisturizer after using this product.    </li>
      <li>These do a great job of clearing up acne and reducing facial oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wasted thousands of dollars on acne treatments, and this was the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Great for keep your skin clean, for the acne is a simple medication.</li>
      <li>Great easy way with a single step to keep your face clean.</li>
      <li>Not much to say, but it&#x27;s a great, cheap product for readily available Salicylic Acid.</li>
      <li>I would always have one or two new acne spots a day and it would be a great day when nothing new popped out on my face.</li>
      <li>These work great and dry out pimples fast.</li>
      <li>Great for removing make up and exfoliating dead skin</li>
      <li>The product is what it is, but it made me break out more, which went completely against the reasoning for adding it to my skincare routine.</li>
      <li>this is the only formula of stridex that has the right ph balance of BHA to be effective.</li>
      <li>I was originally told it would take a few months for my face to adjust to everything, so I&#x27;m still very impressed by my current progress.</li>
      <li>It is the right pH and doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.</li>
      <li>It also seems to clean my face really well.</li>
      <li>Leave on for 30 minutes before moisturizing for best results :) You can expect a small amount of purging when starting this product, as it&#x27;s an exfoliant, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you get a couple pimples after you start using it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;These work great on the chest/back after a hard workout as well - prevents those unsightly &#x27;workout bumps&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I think it works better if you actually scrub your face with some force with these.</li>
      <li>Before you purchase this product, just be aware that the two pack isn&#x27;t a two pack.</li>
      <li>This works pretty good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use these every 2-3 nights and they seem to be making the overall texture of my face better.</li>
      <li>I suffer from rosacea and acne, and these help so much in keeping my skin clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>and it does help my face look clean and clear.</li>
      <li>it will clear up acne pretty quick.</li>
      <li>After Proactiv, Accutane, hormonal birth control, prescription antibiotics, products with no oil, products with more oil, etc., this chemical exfoliant has been the only thing to clear up my acne!  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fully take care of my problem but it definitely made a huge difference in controlling it.</li>
      <li>I also recommend buying sulfate free shampoo, toothpaste, and body wash, because I made that switch the same time I purchased this, and it is a very noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>I use a different product for everyday all over face wash, but again, I always have Stridex on hand for the more challenging blemishes that pop up now and then.</li>
      <li>care intense moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It cleared my skin without any dryness, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, this really helped manage to keep it under control.</li>
      <li>Just a straight up lie.</li>
      <li>So much so, that I continue to buy this product that I would never ever ever put on my face again.</li>
      <li>You only need to lightly cover the skin with the pad and let it sit and do its job.  </li>
      <li>I mainly use for after the gym/sweat.</li>
      <li>I like using these not only on my face, but to clean electronics, or to clean stains, or other things really.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Smoothed my skin well and it was not very irritating.</li>
      <li>My normal moisturizers that kept my skin nice and hydrated could hardly make a dent after using these.</li>
      <li>They are drying, but using the moisturizer directly after really helps balance</li>
      <li>I used cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, or occasionally, Aqua Glycolic facial cleanser advanced cleansing care.</li>
      <li>/r/skincareaddiction in Reddit recommended this paired with CeraVe Foaming Facial cleanser, and as someone who has had moderate to light acne ever since puberty (now 21) this really works.</li>
      <li>It keeps his face clean and dry.</li>
      <li>It also does not dry you out very much.</li>
      <li>I try new hair styles and make up because I don&#x27;t feel like I need to hide my face.</li>
      <li>So for that reason I would not purely rely on Stridex to clean your face.</li>
      <li>Not too drying, and help clear my face up!</li>
      <li>Along with a complete face routine, it has cleared up and prevented new acne from appearing on my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Big plus that they are alcohol free, they will however still dry your skin out.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how clear my face is after all these years and it continues to improve.  </li>
      <li>Not harsh</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement.</li>
      <li>So far it has helped me to clear up the breakouts I had.</li>
      <li>As a male, Ive been battling acne for years, and this seemed to really help.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne for quite some time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad breakouts on the backs of my legs since I can remember. Since I started using the max strength stridex pads, (in combination with CeraVe to moisturize afterwards,) I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement. Breakouts are kept to a minimum, and the pads help dry out breakouts that have just popped up.</li>
    <li> Great easy way with a single step to keep your face clean.</li>
    <li> This is the most inexpensive beta hydroxy acid exfoliant you can find- and a dupe for Paula&#x27;s Choice liquid BHA exfoliant that is 4x the price.</li>
    <li> I like using these not only on my face, but to clean electronics, or to clean stains, or other things really. Anything that is multi use is OK by me.</li>
    <li> The best thing that&#x27;s happened to my face in a long time. Along with a complete face routine, it has cleared up and prevented new acne from appearing on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little drying so be careful to use around the eye area and also make sure to moisturize after the product has dried on your face. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Big plus that they are alcohol free, they will however still dry your skin out. If you&#x27;re planning on using these plan on apply moisturizer afterwards. I mainly use for after the gym/sweat.</li>
    <li> I mean, it works. Hardens up any blemishes so they can come off.</li>
    <li> Love these!! I use this as my BHA and I&#x27;m never switching. I have had acne for years and lots of acne scars. I would always have one or two new acne spots a day and it would be a great day when nothing new popped out on my face. Stridex helped a lot. I use it daily, once a day at night. It didn&#x27;t fully take care of my problem but it definitely made a huge difference in controlling it. Plus it&#x27;s an affordable!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months and my acne has not cleared up at all. In fact, it has even gotten worse. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just started use it, so don&#x27;t know yet how effective it is. but it seems it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
    <li> Before you purchase this product, just be aware that the two pack isn&#x27;t a two pack. It&#x27;s just an individual box. I have no idea why its falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> great price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if this is doing anything or not</li>
    <li> False Advertised as a 2 pack when you are only going to get one pack of 55 pads. Just a straight up lie.</li>
    <li> Easy to use yet it does leave a residue of some sort on your skin. So for that reason I would not purely rely on Stridex to clean your face. Definitely use a face wash as well esp. If you have makeup on. Also- do NOT use on eyes.</li>
    <li> This product def delivers better than way more expensive products that I have used in the past. I love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price. Not harsh and it does help my face look clean and clear.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this product would help my adult cystic acne, but it did. It cleared my skin without any dryness, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve wasted thousands of dollars on acne treatments, and this was the best one I&#x27;ve used. Wish I&#x27;d tried it sooner!</li>
    <li> Love the product, but I was under the impression that I would receive two of these... I chose the &amp;#34;pack of two&amp;#34; option but only received one box. Considering that and the price at an actual store, this was a huge rip-off.</li>
    <li> The strength can be felt with use! Powerful but not too harsh on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t sting or dry out skin.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective product</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin.  I use this ever night before bed.  I would not use this in the mornings as it works so well your skin will be susceptible to getting burnt</li>
    <li> My 18 year old son doesn&#x27;t feel Stridex works that great.  He prefers Hollywood Glam Face &amp;#34;Spotless Face&amp;#34; pads.  At the steep price of $35.00/60 pads, I think I&#x27;ll keep testing out other brands.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my acne, which I&#x27;ve been blessed with since I was 12.  After Proactiv, Accutane, hormonal birth control, prescription antibiotics, products with no oil, products with more oil, etc., this chemical exfoliant has been the only thing to clear up my acne!  Also prevented painful cystic breakouts.  Started using twice a day at first, then lowered it to once a day, and now I use it about once every other day.  Why didn&#x27;t I know about this when I was a teenager?!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not too drying, and help clear my face up!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and these Stridex pads were a little too irritating for my skin, but they are effective.</li>
    <li> I read online this is the only formula of stridex that has the right ph balance of BHA to be effective. For me, it hasn&#x27;t stung (except when I accidentally get it on raw skin). It also seems to clean my face really well.</li>
    <li> Great price, and works well!</li>
    <li> This works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a big pimple on my nose. Once it goes away, it always comes back. Since I&#x27;ve been using this probably 2-3 times a day for 4-5 days, it&#x27;s shrunken considerably in size and is much less red and noticeable. I think it works better if you actually scrub your face with some force with these.</li>
    <li> I love these! I suffer from rosacea and acne, and these help so much in keeping my skin clear and smooth. I notice such a big difference when I stop using them for a couple days.</li>
    <li> This product is great and I swear by it; HOWEVER, the first time I used it, I treated it as a normal face wash and completely dried my skin out, causing an ugly and painful red rash for two days. I use it for SPOT treatment only. If I am starting to get a nasty pimple, I use Stridex Max and within hours a whitehead will start to form (which I pop cause OCD), but you can also just continue to use every so often and it will definitely speed up the removal process. I use a different product for everyday all over face wash, but again, I always have Stridex on hand for the more challenging blemishes that pop up now and then. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Not much to say, but it&#x27;s a great, cheap product for readily available Salicylic Acid. I have sensitive skin, and I use these 1-2 times daily and they have cleared up some skin issues. They are not a miracle product, but if used in a solid routine they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat that I found is that if I miss a day, my skin breaks out really bad, so be sure you have an ample supply at all times.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and has done wonders for my skin. I have dry skin so I have to follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> If by control they meant unleashing the army of white bumps on my face, they controlled me alright. I never had such a problem using any other products. I guess, Stridex is not for me.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter and now is getting some for myself. These work great and dry out pimples fast. I need to buy a lot before they get popular and change the formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using stridex for years and it always works.</li>
    <li> These Stridex pads are easy to use, and help keep my acne at bay. I use these as part of my skin care routine, not as a single-step like it mentions on the package.</li>
    <li> I buy these stridex pads for my son. He uses them on a daily basis. It keeps his face clean and dry. It helps prevent acne breakouts. I would definitely recommend these medicated pads to other teenagers.</li>
    <li> it works on my blackheads...</li>
    <li> /r/skincareaddiction in Reddit recommended this paired with CeraVe Foaming Facial cleanser, and as someone who has had moderate to light acne ever since puberty (now 21) this really works. It also does not dry you out very much. I&#x27;ve tried other things in the past to no avail, but this combination has finally provided results. I also recommend buying sulfate free shampoo, toothpaste, and body wash, because I made that switch the same time I purchased this, and it is a very noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It has helped my acne so much and the price is great.</li>
    <li> So far it has helped me to clear up the breakouts I had. I&#x27;d recommend to start slow and use it every other day at the beginning because it can irritate and dry your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne for quite some time. I get awful, deep, cystic acne on my chin mostly. I&#x27;m in my 30s now and I&#x27;m just so sick of it! A friend recommended these pads to me. She said they&#x27;ve worked wonders for her and I hoped they could do the same for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning when I get up and every night before I go to bed, I wipe my face and chest with one of these pads, wait for the medicated liquid to dry and then massage CeraVe moisturizer into my skin over it. In just weeks, I was seeing amazing results. I went two entire weeks with zero new acne. That&#x27;s basically never ever happened. I can&#x27;t remember going an entire week even without any new acne. During the third week, I got one small blemish, but after two days, it&#x27;s almost gone. I was originally told it would take a few months for my face to adjust to everything, so I&#x27;m still very impressed by my current progress. This would basically be life changing for me, even if this was as good as it was going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the medicated pads to be too harsh on my skin. They are drying, but using the moisturizer directly after really helps balance that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest these to anyone dealing with chronic acne. You just have to be sure to use them every day and not skip or forget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 18, 2015-&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. This product has changed my life. I&#x27;ve been using these pads for about 3 months now and in that three months I&#x27;ve only had one break out. I&#x27;ve had a few small zits here and there, but they were white heads that went away quickly. I am insanely grateful to no long be dealing with cystic acne. I can&#x27;t even explain how that feels. I&#x27;m more confident. I try new hair styles and make up because I don&#x27;t feel like I need to hide my face. I&#x27;m so happy. I still have scars and discoloration from years of cystic acne issues, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;m just so happy to no longer have the physical and emotional pain of dealing with terrible cysts all over my chin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even been swiping these over my shoulders and chest and it&#x27;s done wonders for the small break outs I used to get on my chest, back and shoulders/upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say this has legitimately changed my life. I only wish I had found this solution sooner!all over my chin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even been swiping these over my shoulders and chest and it&#x27;s done wonders for the small break outs I used to get on my chest, back and shoulders/upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say this has legitimately changed my life. I only wish I had found this solution sooner!</li>
    <li> I used one pad one time, and it made my face tight, dry and sore. Even a two days later, my face is red and sore when I touch it. I know it&#x27;s not the salicylic acid because my skin has never reacted to it before, so maybe it&#x27;s the menthol (which is quite strong). I gave these 2 stars because I&#x27;m going to try and use these to take care of keratosis pilaris on my upper arms (I&#x27;ve read salicylic acid can help). I didn&#x27;t have the same reaction on my arms as I did on my face.</li>
    <li> Dunno why this has so many 5 star reviews. It&#x27;s a terrible product. It made my skin super tight after using it and dry as a bone. My normal moisturizers that kept my skin nice and hydrated could hardly make a dent after using these. I have OILY skin and I couldn&#x27;t believe just how drying it was. I&#x27;ve used a few other BHAs and they weren&#x27;t nearly as harsh on my skin as these. Because it irritated my skin so much, it seemed like it actually made my acne worse instead of better.</li>
    <li> clears up my acne, but can be a bit drying.</li>
    <li> Great for removing make up and exfoliating dead skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! use it everyday after washing your face with cleanser. it will clear up acne pretty quick. be sure to moisturize</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Leaves my faces feeling clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Smoothed my skin well and it was not very irritating. Not drying either since it lacks alcohol.</li>
    <li> My skin must be really sensitive because this product caused my to breakout, even if I only left it on my face for 15min.</li>
    <li> What it says on the tin.  Alcohol free and great chemical exfoliant.</li>
    <li> Make sure to give the product some time to settle in before putting on moisturizers, etc. It&#x27;s a chemical exfoliant, so you need to give it AT LEAST like 5-10 minutes before putting on other stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is what it is, but it made me break out more, which went completely against the reasoning for adding it to my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Great for keep your skin clean, for the acne is a simple medication.</li>
    <li> The best cheapest BHA you can use. It is the right pH and doesn&#x27;t have alcohol. After a few weeks of use I rarely get a pimple and if I do it is very small and disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak much to how Stridex works for acne, but it works beautifully for keratosis pilaris (KP). The main ingredient is salicylic acid, which is a BHA and exfoliant, which helps smooth out those chicken skin-like bumps. I simply use a pad after showering, then moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work great on the chest/back after a hard workout as well - prevents those unsightly &#x27;workout bumps&#x27;.</li>
    <li> These do a great job of clearing up acne and reducing facial oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been following the beginners routine on the reddit sub r/skincareaddiction for several months now after years and years of proactiv.  I hate that I didn&#x27;t know about this stuff sooner.  I use this in addition to CeraVe cleanser and lotion and have recently added St. Ive&#x27;s exfoliating pads at night.  After years of harsh products I was able to use Stridex without any bad reactions.  I think the biggest misconception with these pads and the ones from St. Ive&#x27;s is that you should rub hard to exfoliate your skin.  These products serve as chemical exfoliants.  You only need to lightly cover the skin with the pad and let it sit and do its job.  I cannot believe how clear my face is after all these years and it continues to improve.  I no longer need to wear a powder or bb cream foundation and my face has a nice glow.  All the money I&#x27;ve been wasting on overpriced products and Stridex works wonders :)</li>
    <li> As a male, Ive been battling acne for years, and this seemed to really help. My acne has improved, but it could be because im no longer the age of a teen. However, this really helped manage to keep it under control. I used cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, or occasionally, Aqua Glycolic facial cleanser advanced cleansing care. After doing so, i would use up to 2 of these stridex wipes; followed by Elta MD Skin care intense moisturizer. I strongly suggest using moisturizer after using this product.    Overall, ive been using this method for close to a month, or more, and this has been a great buy for me. I will continually purchase these wipes, and i recommend it.    Shipping to Canada, Alberta was great because it arrived 1 day sooner than  estimated date.</li>
    <li> This product is fine, but there&#x27;s definitely better brands with better deals. I think the lack of the alcohol might actually be a bad thing but what do I know about skincare.</li>
    <li> I am not acne prone so I cannot comment help with acne. I use these every 2-3 nights and they seem to be making the overall texture of my face better. scars and pores seem less visible and it seems to be balancing out blemishes. only downside is how dry it makes your face feel but that&#x27;s why I use every few days instead of every night!</li>
    <li> This item was delivered on time and as promised.  I ordered this for my teenage son and it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Love them! Leave on for 30 minutes before moisturizing for best results :) You can expect a small amount of purging when starting this product, as it&#x27;s an exfoliant, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you get a couple pimples after you start using it!</li>
    <li> I really do like this product, but unfortunately, the menthol/fragrance causes severe cystic acne on my face. However, since discovering this, I started using it on my bum after bathing, and my bum is looking glorious!! So much so, that I continue to buy this product that I would never ever ever put on my face again.</li>
