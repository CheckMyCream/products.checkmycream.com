<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for a good price on makeup brushes where I could get a good variety of different brushes. I decided on these because they looked really nice and they had a really reasonable price. There was a few issues receiving them but the seller was REALLY nice and it was no problem, when I received them I was super excited about how they looked, they looked really nice and the pink is a cute touch. I found that they foundation and other face brushes work really well and they spread everything out nicely. The eye shadow brushes do take a little work to get used too and they seem a little too hard but I found that if you work out the brushes they work just fine. I love this brush set and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. The only thing I would change is I would add a blending brush, that&#x27;s the only thing it didn&#x27;t have that I was really looking for, but that&#x27;s no big deal. Love them either way.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not good at all they dont even pick up the product , im so disappointed! They literally come with all the same brushes just smaller ones ,such a waste of money .</li>
    <li> I love it. these are beautifull. are even better in than it looks. they are big. i just love it.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with how these brushes look and feel. I bought them as a gift so I won&#x27;t be using them myself, but I liked them so much that I think I am going to buy myself a set!</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed! The brushes are too flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t really apply any makeup at all. Cute design, but ultimately, they&#x27;re useless😔</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, nice bag. Because they&#x27;re white they look dirty fast. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> very good quality at such a cheap price. they look very adorable, if you like pink, this is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, it&#x27;s better than I expect, they are so cute and soft I recommend this. and It&#x27;s cheap for the quality.</li>
    <li> Great kit.  I bought this almost a year ago and the brushes work great. I&#x27;m a clean freak and I was my brushes once a month with vinegar and soap and they are stil on great quality</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice for the price. I use them a lot with creams but I wish his came with small fluffy blending brushes because it has 0. Love the fan brush and eyebrow combs.</li>
    <li> The product it self is super cute. It&#x27;s soft but maby too soft... they were delivered a day late when I had a guaranteed date since I paid extra for next day delivery. Wasted money on next day delivery option.</li>
    <li> So soft and cute. The color is so pretty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a young girl&#x27;s first make-up set and they are so amazing, I have greedily decided to keep them for myself.  There are so many brushes and they are very high quality.  The girl&#x27;s mother saw them and said, &amp;#34;I might keep these for myself.&amp;#34;  Uhhh, no, because I&#x27;m keeping for myself!  LOL  No, I&#x27;ll probably give them to her and order myself another set.  But TRUTHFULLY, you will be so impressed with these.  The case isn&#x27;t leather, but it is thick and nice and well lined and plenty roomy enough.  It rolls up beautifully and ties and well, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set.  Truly, I&#x27;m shocked at the quality!  The brush fibers look like they are real animal hair of some type, in fact the description says that they are, but not sure what animal.  Maybe a long haired domestic animal, because the fibers are fine and soft, and the way the tips are shaped, you are certain to have a flawless makeup application.  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these!  (I really want to keep this set! :( for myself)</li>
    <li> When I got these they were in a great package but when I started using them. They couldn&#x27;t hold the makeup the bushes kept coming off.</li>
    <li> Great product  for beginners. Beautiful  set</li>
    <li> These brushes are PERFECT. They arrived earlier than expected. They are exactly the colors you see in the photo. The bristles are the perfect firmness/softness depending on the brush and what it&#x27;s supposed to be used for. I haven&#x27;t experienced any trouble with the handles detaching, but they do have a pretty pungent smell when they arrive. I recommend washing them once before you use them. Again, they are lovely! Perfect for any makeup lover.</li>
    <li> These brushes were a lot more than I expected very well put together love them. And you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes, great quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> Brushes feel soft and nice. But there is a really strong odor to them and a case so I had to wash them twice, dry outside in the sun in 2 days to get rid of the smell. I haven&#x27;t tried them on but from the feel I think they are not bad.</li>
    <li> Such a good deal for great brushes! Great quality!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cute and I&#x27;m happy that they really do come with the pink pouch.</li>
    <li> These brushes are GREAT. There just not what I expected them to be. If you are wanting a thicker type brush, like a synthetic brush these arent it. These are very soft and light. The eye makeup brushes though are everything i wanted. those are Incredible. I use those everyday but went and got different face brushes. (I ended up gettinf the sigma brushes)</li>
    <li> very cheap. I&#x27;ll be sending these to my niece as a toy for make up time lol pretty disappointing</li>
    <li> I wanted pink brushes so I ordered these. The top is pink like the picture... but the handle is a metallic brown color. I am kind of disappointed about the color but I guess I can get over it, since the quality of the brushes is great. You do need to wash the brushes before using them! The carrying case is just like it&#x27;s pictured and it even has extra slots. Overall the product was worth the money.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t check the size, i just looked at the picture and y thought it would be like purse size, but it&#x27;s big, like professional brushes big. It&#x27;s not a bad thing, i was just a little surprised when i saw them haha</li>
    <li> They are pretty good quality and the price was really good. One of them did disconnect from the handle. I just gorilla glued it and no issues.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon Reviewers! Because of your reviews I purchased this gem. I was looking for eyeliner brushes - but for $14.01 got a full set of 22 make-up brushes. The larger brushes have covers. There&#x27;s no smell as some others stated. No powdery substance either. Am taking your suggestions and am washing/conditioning these before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found these instructions on Yahoo for breaking in the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse each brush thoroughly with lukewarm tap water. Run through the brush bristles with your fingers to make sure that each bristle is exposed to the water, and massage until each brush is perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the brush heads are still wet, squirt a little dab of hair conditioner into your hand and gently work it into the bristles of each brush. When each brush head is coated, lay them on the counter or on the edge of the sink while you wash the conditioner off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow the conditioner to set for about 90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse each brush head again, making sure that all of the conditioner has been rinsed out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake the excess water off each brush and use your fingers to firmly compress each brush&#x27;s bristles to squeeze out as much water as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry your hands completely with a towel, and then dry each brush. Be very delicate when drying the bristles. You&#x27;ll be able to towel-dry each brush head most of the way, but not all of the way. Allow your brushes to air dry for at least two hours before storing them away in any type of enclosed container.</li>
    <li> These are just ok. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> There soooo pritty, i love them so much</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy such an inexpensive brush set, but I&#x27;m so happy I did! I bought these maybe five months ago, and they&#x27;re still all in great condition and have worked so well for me! There are so many in this kit that I still have a few unused, and there are some copies of some of the brushes for cases when I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wash my brushes and need a clean one. I especially appreciate all of the angled brushes. The only issue I have (which is entirely unimportant) is that the foundation brushes are slightly stained from my foundation. Multiple washes have not removed the color. I don&#x27;t mind though, since I didn&#x27;t buy them for their looks. I also bought a set for my cousin after she saw mine, and she loves them.</li>
    <li> Gift for someone else</li>
    <li> Elegant and gifted possible&lt;br /&gt;Her hair smooth&lt;br /&gt;Smooth in use&lt;br /&gt;Identical to the photo&lt;br /&gt;Color is very beautiful&lt;br /&gt; drawback some hairs fall</li>
    <li> I love this set of brushes. They are as fluffy as they look. The roll case is a good quality. I feel like the shadow and smaller brushes are slightly to stiff. i mainly purchased this for the larger powder brushes. If i had bought this for the smaller ones i would have been slightly disappointed. Stiffer shadow brushes &#x3D; product damage, waist and shadow fall out. For the price these are great. The brush hair has not fallen out or shed. The larger brushes are comparable with my spehora brushes.</li>
    <li> I rated these brushes with 2 stars because when I first got them I tried them and 5 of the brushes broke and when I cleaned them the glue holding the hair into the brushes weakened massively so all the brushes pretty much broke. The hairs keep falling out of them. I wish I would of spent a little bit more money and bought a better brand of brushes. I would not recommend these brushes to anyone not even my daughter for play brushes.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying these brushes are super soft and look just as beautiful in person as they do in the pic. They did not have a smell like some other reviews had mentioned. Also no hair loss. I received them exactly 3 days after ordering and purchased 2 sets. One for myself and one for my sister. Ik she&#x27;ll love them when I give them to her on the her bday in a couple of days (: for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing this 22 piece brush set. Great quality!!! You&#x27;ll  absolutely love these, I promise.</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing! You get every brush you will ever need. The quality of the brushes is fairly good.</li>
    <li> great brushes. at first they smelled a little weird (just a bit like plastic but that didn&#x27;t last too long!) but i absolutely love these brushes and they work so well! and such a selection!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she loved it! She says it does the job and she is very happy with all the brushes.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars. I absolutely love the face brushes (foundation,blush,powder etc..) the eye brushes are a little stiff. I went ahead and washed all of the brushes with extra virgin olive oil (to moisturize the bristles) mixed with dish soap like dawn to disinfect it. That&#x27;s my usual routine to clean my brushes and usually it breaks in the new ones so they won&#x27;t be stiff. Made them a little softer but will keep trying. I&#x27;m in cosmetology school and these will be great for class.!!</li>
    <li> Would you really buy from a company that tell their customers this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear friend,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good day! Thanks for your message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We understand that you are afraid that we cheat your money. But this is impossible. If we have not sent your item out, the tracking number will just show \\&quot;Not Available\\&quot;. In addition, there is no reason for us write back and forth just for cheating you for $30. If you are still worrying about your $30, how about handle it in this way: We first refund you $5 and if the tracking information still fails to update after September 5th, we consider it as lost and refund the rest of the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any question, please feel free to contact us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donner LLC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really they wouldn&#x27;t go back and forth with me over 30 dollars and me waiting nearly 2 months to receive my package and still haven&#x27;t got it. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE PEOPLE!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I just got in the mail today. The shipping was fast, it came within 2 days and it was shipped out the same day I ordered it. The brushes are soft, No shedding &amp; they are just perfect. I 100% recommend this product</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! It came 4 days early and the brushes are so soft and exactly what I ordered. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are all there, covered and it perfect conditions. So cute! Would definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> It didnot have all the brushes that I expect. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected. I needed a blending brush witch it did not come with so i hardly use any of the brushes expect for the face ones</li>
    <li> Great buy for your money!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. Larger brushes are perfect for contouring. Smaller brushes are a very smooth but this also makes it difficult to pick up, for example, eye shadows. I like the brushes. Shipping was fast and easy. Got brushes on time and it great condition.</li>
    <li> Got these months ago and still in great shape</li>
    <li> This is my second Brush set from amazon and I&#x27;m very pleased with both of them!  The brushes are very soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend. She freaked out, recommend it to anyone for their girlfriends, for any occasion.</li>
    <li> I love them , they are so soft !</li>
    <li> Just got my package, and the brushes are in great shape and very soft. But I am very disappointed because I only got 21, not 22 as I was supposed to. And it was one that I really needed. Not very happy about it.</li>
    <li> They would even have eye shadow or any of my products on them when I tried using them. I am not satisfied.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful. So pretty that I hate to use them. I really love that they come with a case. Very appropriate for girly girls.</li>
    <li> Were not what i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft but they dont include brushes for blending which i am really sad about.</li>
    <li> Great value and great variety. My only complaint is the bristles are too soft so you really have to rub them into the makeup firmly in order to transfer and product onto the brush. Still a good starter set.</li>
    <li> I love them! ive been with them for more than a month already! I wash them and stuff nothing falls off, im impressed ill sure come back for them :)</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES. SOOO SOFT AND TAKE MAKEUP VERY WELL</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes. They do not have a bad smell like others have reviewed. Work well with all makeup brands. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow.. better than I expected. So many brushes I had to Google some of them .. great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I love them! Great quality and super soft</li>
    <li> Great seat covers ! The fabric is on fleek!! I love them . I love it ! It matches my car perfectly!</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful! They are sooo soft and I love the pink!</li>
    <li> The color was wrong but overall nice brushes :)</li>
    <li> These started falling apart after the couple weeks.. the tops have fallen off the brushes and when you clean then they shed like crazy.</li>
    <li> Arrived 3 days early. They are very soft and well made. Every brush I need included in set and even more! Only draw back (Fan &amp; 2 Mineral Makeup) Brushes are not firm enough. All Other brushes are firm and soft. They feel really nice on my skin. Please wash before using arrived with a powder residue from packaging.</li>
    <li> The Brushes are beautiful, the best buy for the price out of all others on Amazon and these don&#x27;t shed. I love them! Except, the eyeshadow brushes are shaped too much like concealer brushes with the ends not being fluffy enough and coming to a thin tip at the end, and they don&#x27;t pick up much eyeshadow. I wish the eyebrow brushes (not the ones for brushing, the ones for adding color) were better too, they didn&#x27;t deposit enough color so I&#x27;ve been using my bare minerals eyebrow brush instead. I would still recommend buying these, and just also having a couple of extra brushes to supplement, especially since these are so pretty and will look great on your makeup table. The small fan brush &amp; large fan brush are my favorites.</li>
    <li> Amazinngggg! The brushes came in, packaged great. Every brush have plastic protecting the handle and the bristles. Amazing shape. Only sad thing was that all the eyeshadow brushes looked the same.</li>
    <li> Plastic eyeshadow and they fall apart</li>
    <li> i like them alot, really soft, cute and affordable. im a brush newbie and really enjoy them, but i wished it came with a list of each one and what they&#x27;re called and what they&#x27;re used for. being a beginner i have no clue what each one was properly designed for and what its ment to do. also dont like the actual bag it came with like them in a container on the vanity. wish the bag came with 3-4 big pockets instead on 22 individual ones so i could reuse it for other things. also the handles are not pink, they&#x27;re actually like a pinkish brown, not my favorite color, but thats ok.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. So many to work with.</li>
    <li> the case that held the brushes was soft and beautiful, all the brushes were nice. this product was a perfect buy.</li>
    <li> Seroiusly, super fluffy. These brushes are so soft and feathery. They feel great on my skin. I love the stippling brush, my foundation looks fantastic. There was one problem with these brushes, however.. A few of the ends fell right off because they weren&#x27;t tightly secured to the handle. I&#x27;m not completely helpless, so that wasn&#x27;t even a problem for me.. I used superglue and popped them back on. No big deal, just mildly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course.. the pink is cute!</li>
    <li> The brushes were really soft as described by other users but I was kinda hoping that the large fan brush would be a little thicker and I also wanted more round tipped eyeshadow brushes got quite a few flat top brushes. All in all pretty pink and very girlie.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift.  My daughter said it stunk and the hairs fell out.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so so cute and have so many variety to use. Their EXTREMELY soft which was a surprise because of their price. They are actually a little bit if not equal to the softness of ecotools brushes. I love all the brushes they give in the bundle. The large brushes at first may be a scary take on, but they&#x27;re perfect for powder and blending heavy blushes :)&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with loose strands falling off the brush. The bristles stay put even after weekly washes. Their still pink and soft and fluffy! A great bargain for the price you pay. Perfect for ANY beginner or even experiened make up lover.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! So soft ,so cute and cheap ...need I say more ?</li>
    <li> so soft and adorable!</li>
    <li> Awesome quality! I clean my brushes everyday and my makeup goes on problem free. I work at Sephora and these brushes are just as good. Very soft.</li>
    <li> The smell of the material of the pouch was quite choking when I got my package but it did not last very long, plus I washed the brushes so now I can appreciate doing my make up easily with just what I need and more. I&#x27;m not a professional but I would recommand this set.</li>
    <li> Not sure if they are professional but for the price and amount of brushes, I am so happy with my product </li>
    <li> In love with my brushes. They came quick &amp; there was no problems with the packaging. They are soft, haven&#x27;t experienced any shredding yet. Once I got them I washed them &amp; let them air dry which also got rid of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell which you always smell when you buy new stuff. I give the brushes a thumbs up b/c there pink &amp; cute &amp; affordable.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes. Honestly not sure about the quality. I mean they feel really good to the touch, but I honestly bought these to decorate my vanity. They are so pretty I might not use them for a while.</li>
    <li> Love the make-up brushes</li>
    <li> Great product! Had a funny smell when I first opened them but I am 100% sure it from the packaging...I washed them the night before using them and that took away the smell from the packaging. Bristles are Very soft and I love the long brush handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the great color! I am not very girly but I love the case and color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product! deff. recommend for those who are good at applying make up and those who are just learning!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m soo mad there soon bad and they came out broken Do not buy them!!!! I will not recommended there soo bad!!!! I will naturally even want to give one start</li>
    <li> Super cute but most of them barley work... I mean good for beginners though!</li>
    <li> I loved this product!! So pretty worth every penny</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice and soft! It&#x27;s a great product, I just wish that the brushes were labeled (maybe on the handle) because some of them I&#x27;m not sure what to use them for! Also maybe some care instructions on how to clean, dry and store the brushes!</li>
    <li> waw these brushes are very cute and professional. I definitely recommend it to anyone. i bought 2. :)</li>
    <li> The handles were brown instead of pink, but otherwise ok</li>
    <li> Big brushes were ok the small ones were hard couldn&#x27;t use much for applying eyeshadow but great for creams/liquids</li>
    <li> Really nice soft brushes! Great quality. Wish some of the eye brushes were a little fluffier, and one of the brushes kept popping off of the handle but nothing a little glue can&#x27;t help. So cute and pink!</li>
